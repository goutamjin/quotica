  "It does not pay away a penny from you to say \"am sorry\", \"I won't do that again\"! It does not take away your integrity to appreciate the very little that you have obtained from someone, even if it's not much! True humility speaks \"little is enough if God is in it.": "Israelmore",

He strongly believed in racial equality and denounced the horrors of people having to live under a dictatorship.In 1878, Mart\u00ed was allowed to return to Cuba under a general amnesty, but was once again banished from Cuba after being accused of conspiracy against the Spanish authorities. From 1881 to 1895, he lived and worked in New York City. Moving to Florida, he organized forces for a three-pronged attack supporting the smoldering Cuban War of Independence.

  "Encouragement, Love, HopeThere was a man that struggled with every step and walked each step with fear. As we all know when you walk and pave a path of fear, the steps slow down and the true light of faith dims. His family did, however, stand behind him. Though his steps were slow and not going far, his family followed covering each of those steps with encouragement and hope. As he kept walking and turned his head, the people who cared most weren't clear. His fear had taken over and there was uncertainty that slowed him down even further. The family that stands behind you is the one who gives you the push you need to keep going.The man was saddened with fear and started to sob. Mystery of the unknown was the overwhelming door he wasn't ready to open. His family followed right behind him, saying, \"We are there for you, you are strong; you can make it through the toughest path with the strongest light of hope.\"It seemed he couldn't hear all that was said. It was as if he wasn't truly listening to the strongest words, but to the heavy negativity that kept drowning him in his fear. His steps slowed down even further. He cried some more and was shaken even more by the unknown that was ahead. It was that he didn't want to take a chance of what could come ahead, what could be the most enlightening and most life changing steps he could take to better himself in the future.His family still stood behind him with every step he took. Every time he looked back it was getting dimmer and dimmer, but they were still there. They spoke softly to him, \"Everybody has risks in their lives, even obstacles they must over come. It will only make you stronger in the end, without risks in life, there is no chance.\"He didn't hear them speak; he heard it as if it was another language, something so far from understanding.The man found a bench and sat down. He was tired and didn't want to walk any further. His eyes filled with tears that streamed down his cheeks. His hands starting to cover his face, drowning in the fear that was overwhelming him. Again his loving family was there, but he couldn't see. They were around him with heart-filling encouragement and love, and best of all, that blessedness of hopeThe man lay down on the bench; his tears had soaked his cheeks and palms of his hands and fell asleep. When he awoke, his eyes slowly opened, trying to look around, finding that he was in an unfamiliar place. His vision was a bit fuzzy. He looked down and started to realize he wasn't on the bench anymore.He saw his legs and started to look up further; he was in a hospital gown. The man's eyes grew even more confused.

Teach him there is no shame in tears. Teach him to scoff at cynics and to beware of too much sweetness.Teach him to sell his brawn and brain to the highest bidders; but never to put a price tag on his heart and soul.Teach him to close his ears to a howling mob\u2026 and to stand and fight if he thinks he\u2019s right.Treat him gently; but do not cuddle him because only the test of fire makes fine steel.Let him have the courage to be impatient, let him have the patience to be brave.

However, I have come to learn at this time in my life, that such an attitude is all good for a while, but then there does come a point where you must see and identify yourself; also see and identify others! You have to be able to identify yourself as someone who is made happy by this and as someone who doesn't like that; then when you meet people, discern if those same things are the things that make them happy and if those same things are the things that they don't like, because at a point in time it becomes beneficial to you, to not waste time on blending in behalf of virtue but rather it becomes beneficial to you, to see yourself and go into the direction that makes you happy, taking people with you that are already going in that same direction and who also do not like the things that you do not like.

My heart fought and pleaded, saying it wasn't true, that I was German, and only in Germany would I be content. In one of the few times in my life, intellect overruled emotion.

He gazed at the air as he spoke, as if lecturing an invisible audience - as perhaps he was. \"It certainly is not a passive recording mechanism, like a digital disc or a tape. It is more like a story-telling machine. Sensory information is broken down into shards of perception, which are broken down again to be stored as memory fragments. And at night, as the body rests, these fragments are brought out from storage, reassembled and replayed. Each run-through etches them deeper into the brain's neural structure. And each time a memory is rehearsed or recalled it is elaborated. We may add a little, lose a little, tinker with the logic, fill in sections that have faded, perhaps even conflate disparate events. \"In extreme cases, we refer to this as confabulation.

Thus the grains of sand multiplied, little by little, until they filled the cell and I was dying beneath that hemisphere of sand. I realized that I was dreaming; with a vast effort I woke myself. But waking up was useless\u2014I was suffocated by the countless sand.

Now she had a new project that consumed her every waking moment- the cooking school. It was true that she didn't have the official certification from a prestigious institute, but she had something that couldn't be taught- a God-given talent in the kitchen.She clung to that gift, grateful to let the passion consume her and fill her days with a joyous pursuit.

  "Merleau-Ponty's painting inhabits the same rhetoric as early cinema: it makes the invisible visible, or rather it makes visibility visible; it forms from the thresholds of the visible and invisible world, an order, mode, or aesthetic of visuality. Not only of the small or fast, but of visibility as such. The visuality of the visible and the invisible is found in the mixture of the body and its world, of your body and your world, all your worlds, all your bodies in this world and all those others. Painting is the process by which the visuality of the visible and invisible is made manifest: \"Painting mixes up all our categories in laying out its oneiric universe of carnal essences, of effective likenesses, of mute meanings.\" Each painting is a universal archive, a picture of the universe, a universal image\u2014and like a dream.": "Akira",

  "March 1898What a strange dream I had last night! I wandered in the warm streets of a port, in the low quarter of some Barcelona or Marseille. The streets were noisome, with their freshly-heaped piles of ordure outside the doors, in the blue shadows of their high roofs. They all led down towards the sea. The gold-spangled sea, seeming as if it had been polished by the sun, could be seen at the end of each thoroughfare, bristling with yard-arms and luminous masts. The implacable blue of the sky shone brilliantly overhead as I wandered through the long, cool and sombre corridors in the emptiness of a deserted district: a quarter which might almost have been dead, abruptly abandoned by seamen and foreigners. I was alone, subjected to the stares of prostitutes seated at their windows or in the doorways, whose eyes seemed to ransack my very soul.They did not speak to me. Leaning on the sides of tall bay-windows or huddled in doorways, they were silent. Their breasts and arms were bare, bizarrely made up in pink, their eyebrows were darkened, they wore their hair in corkscrew-curls, decorated with paper flowers and metal birds. And they were all exactly alike!They might have been huge marionettes, or tall mannequin dolls left behind in panic - for I divined that some plague, some frightful epidemic brought from the Orient by sailors, had swept through the town and emptied it of its inhabitants. I was alone with these simulacra of love, abandoned by the men on the doorsteps of the brothels.I had already been wandering for hours without being able to find a way out of that miserable quarter, obsessed by the fixed and varnished eyes of all those automata, when I was seized by the sudden thought that all these girls were dead, plague-stricken and putrefied by cholera where they stood, in the solitude, beneath their carmine plaster masks... and my entrails were liquefied by cold. In spite of that harrowing chill, I was drawn closer to a motionless girl. I saw that she was indeed wearing a mask... and the girl in the next doorway was also masked... and all of them were horribly alike under their identical crude colouring...I was alone with the masks, with the masked corpses, worse than the masks... when, all of a sudden, I perceived that beneath the false faces of plaster and cardboard, the eyes of these dead women were alive.Their vitreous eyes were looking at me...I woke up with a cry, for in that moment I had recognised all the women. They all had the eyes of Kranile and Willie, of Willie the mime and Kranile the dancer. Every one of the dead women had Kranile's left eye and Willie's right eye... so that every one of them appeared to be squinting.Am I to be haunted by masks now?": "Jean",

  "He hoped and feared,' continued Solon, in a low. mournful voice; 'but at times he was very miserable, because he did not think it possible that so much happiness was reserved for him as the love of this beautiful, innocent girl. At night, when he was in bed, and all the world was dreaming, he lay awake looking up at the old books against the walls, thinking how he could bring about the charming of her heart. One night, when he was thinking of this, he suddenly found himself in a beautiful country, where the light did not come from sun or moon or stars, but floated round and over and in everything like the atmosphere. On all sides he heard mysterious melodies sung by strangely musical voices. None of the features of the landscape was definite; yet when he looked on the vague harmonies of colour that melted one into another before his sight he was filled with a sense of inexplicable beauty. On every side of him fluttered radiant bodies, which darted to and fro through the illuminated space. They were not birds, yet they flew like birds; and as each one crossed the path of his vision he felt a strange delight flash through his brain, and straightaway an interior voice seemed to sing beneath the vaulted dome of his temples a verse containing some beautiful thought. Little fairies were all this time dancing and fluttering around him, perching on his head, on his shoulders, or balancing themselves on his fingertips. 'Where am I?' he asked. 'Ah, Solon?' he heard them whisper, in tones that sounded like the distant tinkling of silver bells, \"this land is nameless; but those who tread its soil, and breathe its air, and gaze on its floating sparks of light, are poets forevermore.' Having said this, they vanished, and with them the beautiful indefinite land, and the flashing lights, and the illumined air; and the hunchback found himself again in bed, with the moonlight quivering on the floor, and the dusty books on their shelves, grim and mouldy as ever.'(\"The Wondersmith\")": "Fitz-James",

There were orange traffic cones and beautiful lapis lazuli insects with mandibles of gold. A young girl was being led through the streets. She was taken to a pyre where she was wound in a sheet and placed up on a platform built from sticks. The bright fire that consumed her brought my mother into that deep, light, dreamlike bliss.

  "The finished clock is resplendent. At first glance it is simply a clock, a rather large black clock with a white face and a silver pendulum. Well crafted, obviously, with intricately carved woodwork edges and a perfectly painted face, but just a clock.But that is before it is wound. Before it begins to tick, the pendulum swinging steadily and evenly. Then, then it becomes something else.The changes are slow. First, the color changes in the face, shifts from white to grey, and then there are clouds that float across it, disappearing when they reach the opposite side. Meanwhile, bits of the body of the clock expand and contract, like pieces of a puzzle. As though the clock is falling apart, slowly and gracefully.All of this takes hours.The face of the clock becomes a darker grey, and then black, with twinkling stars where numbers had been previously. The body of the clock, which has been methodically turning itself inside out and expanding, is now entirely subtle shades of white and grey. And it is not just pieces, it is figures and objects, perfectly carved flowers and planets and tiny books with actual paper pages that turn. There is a silver dragon that curls around part of the now visible clockwork, a tiny princess in a carved tower who paces in distress, awaiting an absent prince. Teapots that pour into teacups and minuscule curls of steam that rise from them as the seconds tick. Wrapped presents open. Small cats chase small dogs. An entire game of chess is played.At the center, where a cuckoo bird would live in a more traditional timepiece, is the juggler. Dress in harlequin style with a grey mask, he juggles shiny silver balls that correspond to each hour. As the clock chimes, another ball joins the rest until at midnight he juggles twelve balls in a complex pattern.After midnight, the clock begins once more to fold in upon itself. The face lightens and the cloud returns. The number of juggled balls decreases until the juggler himself vanishes.By noon it is a clock again, and no longer a dream.": "Erin",

  "Candice had been writing for two days\u2019 straight, working on her publisher\u2019s book deadline, when she wrote the end, smiled, and set the book aside. She would start proofing it tomorrow after she\u2019d given her brain a break. Now she\u2019d do what she always did when she finished a book, or reached a good stopping point in one. Clean house. Check her backlog of emails. Pick up some more groceries. And take a run on the wolf side.She finished vacuuming and dusting, swearing every window must let all the outdoors in, and then started a batch of gingerbread cookie cutouts to celebrate finishing another book and the Christmas holiday season. While they were baking, she finally settled down to check her emails. Fan mail always came first, and one from her website got her attention right off. She opened it up and read: Hello, I\u2019m Owen Nottingham, private investigator for White River Investigations, White River Falls, Minnesota and my client, Strom Hart, hired me to locate you. Your parents, John and Cynthia Hart, left you an inheritance and you need to see the lawyer about it so that you can claim it. I need to verify that you are the right woman first. Is there any way that we can possibly meet and get this taken care of so you can collect your inheritance? Strom Hart will be the one to receive it by the end of the month otherwise. His assistant, Jim Winchester, said Mr. Hart is your uncle.\u201dShe reread the message again, not believing her eyes, tears filling them. She quickly looked at the date of the message. Two days ago! She knew she shouldn\u2019t have neglected her emails, but when she was into the story, she couldn\u2019t break away.She ground her teeth, raised her fingers to respond, and heard a knocking at her door. No one came here. Never. Ever. Not even salesmen.She glanced at her phases-of-the moon calendar. The waxing gibbous was just beginning. She should be fine. Just to be on the safe side, in case the person at the door was trouble, she pulled a can of mace from her desk drawer and headed for the door. She peered through the peephole. A handsome black-haired man waited at the door, with rugged features and intense blue eyes. He was dressed in a black suit, a red shirt, and a dark purple tie covered in red, purple, and gold Christmas balls. She raised her brows.\u201cI\u2019m Owen Nottingham,\u201d he said to the door, holding up his PI license and driver\u2019s license. He couldn\u2019t know that she was watching him, so he must have hoped she was there, observing him. \u201cI tried getting hold of you on your contact form on your website about your inheritance. Your contact form might not be working, so I had to locate you in person.\u201dSo this was the man who had sent the message. But was he for real? He had to be. He wouldn\u2019t have come all this way to see her if he wasn\u2019t. But how had he found her? She opened the door, the bells jingling on her Christmas wreath, and he glanced down at the can of mace in her hand. He smiled, his gaze holding hers with such intensity, it was as though he could see clear through to her soul. \u201cReally, just a PI doing my job.\u201dA chilly breeze carried his scent to her. Wolf scent. She felt so lightheaded all at once, she grabbed the door to keep herself upright, and dropped the can of mace on the tile floor. It clattered, but she couldn\u2019t reach for it if her life depended on it. Oh. My. God.This couldn\u2019t be real. He couldn\u2019t be real. No wonder he was talking to the door. He must have heard her footfalls as she\u2019d approached.He took a deep breath at the same time and his eyes widened in surprise when he smelled her scent. His hand shot out to grab her arm and steady her. For a minute, as she tried to control her breathing, her heart rate, neither of which she could steady. She felt like she was going to pass out.\u201cHell, you\u2019re the wolf I saw across the White River, aren\u2019t you?": "Terry",
  "Owen couldn\u2019t believe his luck. Candice Mayfair was the beautiful white wolf he\u2019d seen that day so long ago. Not that she looked like a wolf right now. He only knew she was the wolf, unequivocally, because he recognized her scent. After the initial shock of seeing an unfamiliar and intriguing Arctic she-wolf, he\u2019d gone after her.The whole pack had gone on a run that night, but they knew to stay far away from any campsite. He and the other guys had swum across the river to explore a bit. Cameron and his mate had stayed on the other side with the kids. He\u2019d even swum back across the river to find her and discovered her scent had led right to one of the tents. Since she had moved into the tent, he knew she had to be one of their shifter kind. He\u2019d even hung around the next day, waiting to catch a glimpse of her, but there were several women, and he had no idea which one had been her. Two blonds, a couple of brunettes, and a red-haired woman\u2014none of whom looked like the picture he had of Clara Hart, though.Being a white wolf in summer had made it difficult to blend in, so he\u2019d had to keep well out of sight.Candice Mayfair was definitely the author of the books on the website, though she didn\u2019t look like the photo her uncle had of her, if she was Clara Hart. She had the same compelling eyes, different color, but they got his attention, grabbed hold, and wouldn\u2019t let go.He carried her to her couch and set her down, staying close, his hand still on her arm until she seemed to regain her equilibrium.\u201cThe wolf pup was yours,\u201d she accused, jerking her arm away from him.\u201cWolf pup?\u201d\u201cYeah, wolf pup. Don\u2019t pretend you don\u2019t know about your own wolf pup.\u201dThen all the pieces began to fall into place. Campers. Campfire. Food. Corey, the wolf pup she had to be referring to, hadn\u2019t just found the food like they\u2019d thought. Candice must not have been a wolf until that night.\u201cYou fed him? Corey? His mom wondered why he smelled of beef jerky that night. We thought he\u2019d found some at the campsite. Don\u2019t tell me\u2026he bit you.": "Terry",

  "Why did you turn me?\u201d she\u2019d screamed in his face, close enough for saliva. \u201cYou didn\u2019t know me. You didn\u2019t owe me anything. I don\u2019t deserve this. Why didn\u2019t you leave me in the coma? Why didn\u2019t you let me die?": "Alix",

  "Look, at those foolish men in my day we did it the proper way!\u201d he started to say as if he was looking deep within his memory.": "Nicole",
  "Did you\u2026 need something?\u201d he asked in a tight voice.\tI swallowed hard, my mind racing with a million things to say. The fear pricking at me, telling me I had one last chance to wimp out. To walk away.\tBut I shook my head. No. Not this time.\t\u201cYes,\u201d I said simply. \u201cI need something.\u201d\t\u201cAnd what, may I ask, do you need?\u201d\tI met his eyes. \u201cYou.": "Mari",

  "She hesitated. \"You know I'm older than you, right?\" Richard stared down at her and forced himself not to laugh at the irony. He may be over two hundred years old, but he looked as if he were in his late twenties, thirty at the most. And Jenna was worried that her being thirty-seven would be a problem?A hint of insecurity entered her features. \"I don't mean to press this, but... I dated a guy once--- very briefly---who said the same thing until his friends found out and started to razz him about it. I'm thirty-seven. Are you sure that isn't a problem?\"\"I don't know why his friends would tease him about dating you unless they were envious. You look like you're in your twenties, Jenna. Not much older than your son, in fact. And, if you looked like you were in your forties, guess what.

The attentions she\u2019d given herself had never felt that good. In her dreams, it had never felt that good. But then, it wasn\u2019t him in the flesh. Not like now.Nikolai removed his fingers, then placed a gentler openmouthed kiss on her sex, licking slowly with the flat of his tongue. Sienna whimpered and scooted up the bed, far too sensitive there now.He gazed up and grinned, licking his bottom lip before he sucked the two fingers he\u2019d had inside of her with a long slide from his mouth. \u201cI could taste you forever.\u201d\u201cMy heart would give out in a day,\u201d she panted, incredulous he would do and say something so naughty. \u201cPerhaps in an hour.\u201dHe chuckled and launched himself up and over her. \u201cI like seeing that flush in your cheeks.\u201d He nipped her lips. \u201cAnd hearing that smile in your voice.\u201dShe wondered how he could see anything, but then again, he was vampire. \u201cWell, I like breathing.\u201d She panted heavily still. \u201cSo give me a moment to catch my breath.\u201dHe settled beside her, pulled the covers over them, and wrapped a strong arm around her waist, pulling her over till her head rested on his chest. \u201cTake all the time you need.\u201dHis voice was light and airy, unlike his usual brooding self.She tilted her head toward him. \u201cYou\u2019re happy with yourself, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cQuite.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve never experienced something like that before.\u201dShe had no experience with men, but she thought she knew enough from watching farm animals. Apparently not.\u201cI am certainly glad to hear that,\u201d he said only slightly more serious. \u201cIf another man tried to do that to you, I\u2019d have to rip out his tongue.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re very territorial.\u201d\u201cVery. Glad you\u2019ve noted.\u201dStrange how that act of intimacy had washed away the angst and tension from before. Then she realized that was exactly what he was trying to do. He\u2019d wanted her pleasure alone, he\u2019d said. He\u2019d certainly gotten it.\u201cIs it always like that?\u201d she asked, almost too shy, but enjoying the intimacy that had grown between them in the dark.\u201cNo.\u201d He flatted his palm, fingers spread, over her abdomen under the covers. \u201cIt will be better next time.\u201d\u201cBetter?\u201dHe laughed and lowered his head, sweeping his lips across hers. Not a kiss, but a reminder that they\u2019d knocked down a wall between them and there was no rebuilding it.Then he whispered, \u201cWait till you see what it feels like when I\u2019m buried deep inside you.": "Juliette",

Which is why I\u2019m here.\u201d He turned to Colton again. \u201cI can use my contacts to locate the group holding the Holy Grail, but the American government can\u2019t be tied to the recovery effort in any way.\u201d\u201cSo what are you sayin\u2019?\u201d Colton held his breath.\u201cI\u2019m saying who better to steal it back than a band of pirates?": "Lisa",
  "As soon as the garage door lowered, he slid his hand into her hair, drawing her in for another kiss. Her mouth tasted like sweet brandy and spice. Damn, she was delicious.She ran her hands down his chest and tugged his shirt free from his jeans. He groaned as her cool hands explored his bare abs. His other hand wandered up from her waist, enjoying her curves until he was cupping her breast. She moaned into his mouth and arched her back into his touch, and he just about lost it right there.He pulled back, his voice a husky whisper. \u201cI need more room and fewer clothes.": "Lisa",
  "He sighed, breaking the eye contact. \u201cI just wanted you to know why I\u2019m cautious. When the divorce was final, I swore I\u2019d never let another woman into my heart.

  "Her roommate was at the table with a grin that was all trouble. \u201cSo you\u2019re not going to tell me about last night?\u201dErica rolled her eyes and went about getting her breakfast. \u201cYou saw Reed. How do you think it went?\u201dShe chuckled. \u201cBeing hot doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re good in bed.\u201dErica peered over her shoulder. \u201cWe never even got to the bed.\u201dTrin\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cOh gods!

  "She wet her lips. \u201cAnd she didn\u2019t warn you about me?\u201d\u201cShould she have?\u201dErica finished her drink, relishing the burn in her belly and the flush of heat in her cheeks as she nodded. \u201cDefinitely.\u201dHis gaze smoldered. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing danger is my calling, then.\u201d\u201cGood to know,\u201d she said with a sly smile.": "Lisa",

  "For what felt like hours, we sucked on each other\u2019s tongues while his hands seemed determined to search out and skillfully caress every spot on my body within reach that made me shudder and moan, his rock-hard erection equally determined to stimulate me into a frenzy as he sensually rubbed himself almost teasingly against my pelvis. Then before I knew it, his considerable girth was inside me,": "Cristina",
  "What did that mean,\u201d I asked softly.He didn\u2019t pretend to misunderstand. \u201c\u00cd\u2019m not certain,\u201d Sethian admitted, his eyes staring intently at my own. \u201cIt could be nothing; or everything.\u201d Slowly he withdrew from me and rolled over to his side, pulling me into a tight embrace as if reluctant to have me even an inch away from him. As I lay silently in his arms, a maelstrom of emotions swept through me. Curiosity, puzzlement, excitement, worry, fear; and I realized they were not my own. Confusion and anxiety were the only emotions I felt in any large quantity. Those other emotions seemed almost alien, except that they left the feel of Sethian in their wake. I glanced at Sethian and found him looking down at me. It was apparent that he had been staring down at me for some time. \u201cWhy are you afraid,\u201d I asked on a whim.": "Cristina",
  "She shivered as a blustery wind rushed past. She\u2019d made a mistake in returning to the city. She should\u2019ve stayed in the castle with Antoine. She\u2019d be warm in his arms right now, instead of being held prisoner.": "Lisa",

  "My new elf husband wasted no time in carrying me to the bed, then tumbling us both onto the coverlet.": "Cristina",
  "It could have been a second, an hour, a year, a hundred millennia; all were correct. The first thing I saw when my wits returned was the utter shock in Sethian\u2019s eyes.

  "My face was burning so hotly that I imagined flames were consuming my cheeks.

  "That kiss...\"\"You've already given me better than I've ever had.": "Lisa",

  "His enormous cock slid into my slick passage once again, stretching my delicate tissues to the brink of what I could comfortably handle, and my feelings of excitement and arousal exploded exponentially. I moved to wrap my legs around him, but before I could, he dug his arms beneath my back and lifted us both up until he was sitting back onto his haunches and I was straddling him across his lap, his cock reaching even deeper into me so that I felt that it was almost splitting me in two.": "Cristina",

With plaited coils of dark luscious hair, lips like the petals of a rose, and large, deep eyes that contained all the delight of her passion. She was the loveliest girl I have ever seen in all my life. Then she spoke. I have never heard such a voice before. It seemed she was instantly Juliet. From deep tones to flute-like music like the lark, she spoke and sang her parts with an excitement that stirred the whole audience. She concluded to thunderous applause and I could barely contain my own appreciation.": "Brian",

There were books written about lips that kissable.": "Paige",
  "She tilted her head up to look him in the eyes. \"No diseases, right?\" she asked, before she lost all reason. \"No weird shifter thing I should know about beforehand?\"\t\"All human normal,\" he said, his eyes dark and intense as he looked at her.

  "A roll of five condoms unfurled from her hand. \"I found these in your bathroom.\"\t\"Did you check the expiration date?\" God knew it had been a while since he'd needed one of those.\tShe nodded. \"We're okay, if you're okay.\"\t\"Baby,\" he growled. \"We're headed for something exponentially better than just okay.": "Kathy",
  "If that\u2019s what you want, I\u2019ll give that to you. However, I need you to know that my heart, my mind and my soul belong to you. No one else can touch them like you because you and I both know that we are mates.": "Brey",
  "If he'd cut off his right arm to make her happy, then how much harder could it be to cut out his heart?": "Kathy",
  "Sweetheart, this is not a race to the finish line. It\u2019s you and me, spending time together and getting to know each other better. Just that simple.": "Brey",

He leaned back to tear his clothes off. \u201cMy mind hardly works at all when you are near.\u201d She chuckled leaning back on her elbows, enjoying the view of naked flesh being revealed. She rose up on her knees and traced the ridges on his chest and abdomen. As her fingers trailed down toward his proud shaft, he captured her wrists.\u201cBe careful.\u201d He smiled down at her. \u201cI\u2019m loaded and might go off any minute.\u201dShe laughed. \u201cYou\u2019ve been watching too many old Western movies with Harold.": "Asa",
  "Can\u2019t a girl wear something pretty without you getting ideas of bedding her?\u201d Naya reached up, putting her hand behind his neck to pull him down for a kiss. She\u2019d never get enough of touching him. Of trusting him.": "Asa",
  "Why are you walking through the wood alone?": "Lisa",
  "The tree witches kept to themselves, a self-sufficient coven specializing in certain skills. The witches sang, played music, and danced at the gatherings around the fire, but nothing like what she'd experienced when the gargoyles transformed. After the first night, she was hooked.It was a risk to return but one she was willing to take. She'd ventured to that different world to hear the unique groups, especially to watch the guitarist with hair as black as midnight.": "Lisa",
  "The five statutes loomed above the crowd, still and timeless. The last light of the setting sun cast an eerie glow around them. When she fixed her gaze on Mason's stone form, her heart thumped. She scanned every inch of his silhouette, wondering about the spark of life within the stone that would animate him into flesh. A warm-blooded male with a heated touch and sensuous lips that made her melt.": "Lisa",
  "I'm consumed with thoughts of you. Have you bewitched me?": "Lisa",
  "They soared past the dark shapes of animals, grazing in the fields.\"What are they?\" she asked.\"Sheep,\" Mason replied. \"I once heard someone describe them as floating like clouds across the hills.": "Lisa",
  "Heat radiated from him, penetrating her like the sun warming her on hot midsummer days. It coiled inside her, low in her belly, and sank lower. She recognized it, the magic between lovers. Intoxicating and intense. An all-consuming attraction. The air between them shimmered with energy, an irresistible force connecting them.": "Lisa",
  "In decades past, the three clans of the island - tree witches, gargoyles, and wolves, had cloaked their land with many layers of protection. Their combined magic had created such a powerful force it had remained undetected by human technology. When a feud erupted between the witches and gargoyles twenty-five years ago it led to a division of land. Without reinforcements from the clans' combined magic, the protection seeped away.": "Lisa",
  "Sam held one of the mice up by its tail over the box and then hesitated. \"Her, you want to have a go?\"...\tIf Sam thought she was going to squeal at the sight of nature in the raw, he had a lot to learn.\tBella fed the owlet, cheering as he gulped down his food with a greedy intensity that bode well for the little guy's future recovery. And she grinned to herself when she heard Sam mutter under this breath. \"This has got to be the weirdest first date in history.": "Deborah",
  "Bella laughed, her head thrown back to expose the smooth line of her throat, and Sam suddenly lost his train of thought. While they'd been eating, the sun had set, and the sight of Bella standing in the moonlight laughing took his breath away. He didn't think he'd ever seen anything so beautiful in his life.\tAnd that was more terrifying than any fire.": "Deborah",
  "You know, like Prince Charming. Because you never know, maybe he's an enchanted prince under an evil spell.\"\t\"Life isn't a fairy tale, you know,\" Sam said.\t\"Wanna bet?\" The teen smirked at him.": "Deborah",
  "You're welcome to join us again sometime,\" Bella said....\t\"Right. Well, I don't know.\" Sam looked at the ground. scuffing one boot in the dirt. \"I'm usually not very good company.\"\t\"I'm hanging out with a teenager and a temperamental cat.\" Bella said with a small smile. \"The bar is set very low around here.": "Deborah",
  "Son, if you were any farther from fine you'd be in Nebraska.": "Deborah",
  "You say wicked like it's a bad thing.": "Deborah",
  "You should stay,\" he repeated. \"The worst of the storm may be over, but it is still raining. It's pitch-black out there, and you're already tired and soaked to the bone. \"Not exactly great conditions for riding a dirt bike. I wouldn't want you to get hurt.\"\tBella took another small step toward him, tilting her head up so she could look into his eyes.\t\"And that's the only reason you want me to stay?\" To keep me safe?\"\tSam shook his head. \"No. Not the only reason.\" And he leaned down to kiss her, suddenly realizing he'd been wanting to do it since the day he met her.": "Deborah",
  "I have no clue what happened to my best friend, the one who played with me on the playground when no one else would. But this Logan\u2026\u201d She gestured from my shoes on up. \u201cThis Logan can kiss my ass.": "Lisa",
  "You made me feel like I was the most important person in the world to you, and then you showed me I never really mattered at all.\u201d I stood up. \u201cI hate you for that, Log": "Lisa",

Giving her up the first time nearly killed me, and hurting her again wasn\u2019t an option.None of it would matter if I couldn\u2019t convince her to give me another chance. While she said she hated me, her body told another story. Her pulse had raced, and the scent of her arousal haunted me.Plus, she kissed me back.": "Lisa",
  "She shook her head, her smile fading a little. \u201cI forget you\u2019re a rock star now. To me, you\u2019re just Logan.\u201dI took her hand. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want to be.": "Lisa",
  "You want to prove you never stopped loving me?\u201d She got up and stared down at me. \u201cStart by trusting me with the truth.": "Lisa",
  "Enough.\u201d I rolled my eyes and would\u2019ve smacked him with my laptop if I wasn\u2019t worried his hard head would break my computer. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make me throw up.\u201dHe finally glanced my way, the corner of his mouth quirked up into a crooked smile. \u201cGod, I\u2019ve missed you.": "Lisa",
  "Props?\u201d\u00a0 She was almost afraid to ask.\u201cJust the usual.\u00a0 Stethoscope, tongue depressor... scalpel, bone saw, rib spreaders\u2026 just the normal stuff.\u201d\u201cMaybe in future you should ditch the props, be less Nurse Ratched and more soft porn first day on the job candy striper.\u201dDarcy look genuinely puzzled for a brief moment. \u201cWhere would the fun be in that for me?": "Jane",
  "Katarina wasn\u2019t afraid of Baden. Not anymore.He took a step to the side, intending to move around her. Oh, no. She flattened her hands on his shoulders, keeping him in place.\u201cI want to know what\u2019s wrong with you.\u201d She said. \u201cTell me.\u201dHe snapped his teeth at her in a show of dominance. \u201cYou think you want to know my problem. You\u2019re wrong.\u201dHer tone dry, she said, \u201cI\u2019m so glad you know my mind better than I do.\u201d\u201cVery well. I need sex.\u201d He threw the words at her as if they were weapons. \u201cBadly.\u201dWhoa. Blindside!Heart pounding, she jerked her hands away from him. \u201cSex...from me?\u201d\u201cYesss.\u201d A hiss. \u201cOnly from you.\u201dOnly. Amazing how one little word could send pleasure soaring through her, warming her. \u201cYou told me never to touch you.\u201d Which she\u2019d just done, she realized. My bad.\u201cI\u2019ve changed my mind.\u201d His gaze dropped, lingered on her lips.Burning her... \u201cBut you and I...we\u2019re a different species.\u201d As if that mattered to her body. Gimme!\u2028He took a step closer, invading her personal space. \u201cWe\u2019ll fit, I promise you.\u201d\u2028Tristo hrmenych! The raspy quality of his voice, all smoke and gravel...she shivered with longing. Must resist his allure.But...but...why? Before she\u2019d committed to Peter, she\u2019d dated around, had made out in movie theaters, cars and on couches. She\u2019d liked kissing and touching and \u201criding the belt buckle,\u201d as her friends had called it. Then, after committing to Peter, she\u2019d gifted him with her virginity. At first, he hadn\u2019t known what to do with her\u2014he\u2019d been just as inexperienced\u2014and she\u2019d left each encounter disappointed. When finally she\u2019d gathered the courage to tell him what she wanted, he\u2019d satisfied her well.She missed sex. But connection...intimacy...she thought she missed those more.The dogs barked, jolting her from her thoughts. They\u2019d cleaned their food bowls, and now wanted to play. She clasped Baden\u2019s hand to lead him out of the kennel. He jerked away, severing contact.One action. Tons of hurt.\u201cI\u2019m allowed to touch you and you want to have sex with me, but you\u2019re still disgusted by me.\u201d She stomped outside the kennel, done with him. \u201cWell, I\u2019m leaving. Good riddance! Your do-what-I-say-or-else attitude was annoying, anyway.\u201dHe darted in front of her, stopping her. Breath caught in her throat as sunlight streamed over him, paying his chiseled features absolute tribute, making his bronzed skin glimmer.So beautiful. Too beautiful.\u201cI\u2019m not disgusted by you. You need me. I\u2019ve come to accept it,\u201d he admitted, looking away from her. \u201cBut being skin-to-skin with another is painful for me. We\u2019ll have to proceed carefully. And you\u2019ll get over your annoyance.\u201dAnother order! She would show him the error of his ways.": "Gena",
  "Hey, what are you doing with your hand?\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0Eli\u2019s voice came out high pitched in surprise, as she clutched at Rafe\u2019s shoulders.\u201cIt\u2019s the best place for leverage if you\u2019re going to make that ladder.\u201d\u201cMy ass?\u00a0 Really?\u201d \u201cWhat can I say, I\u2019ve done the math, factored in the weight and height ratios and your ass is definitely where I will gain the most leverage in lifting you.": "Jane",

  "Love and hate aren't as far apart as you think.": "Lisa",
  "I never thought my life would end like this. Being hunted by mythological creatures in my pajamas. Honestly, it never entered my mind.": "Amanda",
  "I ordered a hot chocolate and Chandler got a black coffee. He smiled over at me. \"Still no love for coffee?\"I shook my head. \"Nah, why have bitter and gross when I can have sweet and delicious?": "Lisa",
  "Come closer.\" His voice was more of a growl than a whisper. Hot.": "Lisa",
  "His deep voice rumbled. \"You are all that ever mattered to me.": "Lisa",
  "They say past performance is indicative of future behavior. If there was any truth to that statement, then I knew I had to be careful of the choices I made. My decisions were much more crucial now, as they affected the entire human population. One wrong move, and I could possibly wipe out the world. That was one thing I definitely didn't want on my shoulders.": "Christine",
  "She went on tiptoe and pecked his cheek with a kiss. Daring of her, she knew.\tHis green eyes went dragon-gold and sharp, the bones of his forehead morphing slightly to suggest the crowned brow of the dragon inside. At least he was smiling, though it was the kind of greedy grin that would send most people running in the opposite direction.\tNot her.\t\"Let's just get this over with,\" she said.\t\"Yes.\" His voice had gone rumbly. \"And then on to something else.": "Erin",
  "Nothing can age a dragon, but you just might be the exception.": "Erin",
  "I'm glad you turned cartwheels here.\"\tSamantha heard the note of loneliness in his voice. \"You did hear me say back tuck? Because that was my coolest move.\"\tHis arm came around her shoulders, and they started across the space again. \"Back tuck. Coolest move. Got it.": "Erin",
  "Two human families have died out on me in the past century alone.\"\tWarrick inclined his head. \"It might help if you didn't eat members of your staff when you're displeased.": "Erin",
  "She'd survived Brandon. Just to die all over again. \"Well, hell.\"\tHe smiled wanly at her. \"Indeed.": "Erin",
  "Heat roared within him. Greedy heat. He wanted her....\tShe was in over her head, and it seemed... so was he.": "Erin",
  "The dragon in him didn't want to give her a choice. Just wrap around her and smolder smugly, daring anyone who came near to cross him. Mine.": "Erin",
  "It'll all be over soon, and you can go back to ruling the world.\" She slid off her stool....\tHe watched her go. Felt unaccountably lonely.\t\"When did I stop ruling the world?\" he called after her.": "Erin",
  "OMG I just saw Warrick Voclain on 5th Ave! #DragonSighting #DragonInMyPants #Dragons #RuinedForAllOtherMen.": "Erin",
  "He gaped at her. \"You want me to wear it?\"\t\"Yes. That's what a chain of diamond is for....Wear it. Wear it all the time, even when you sleep. I need you to wear it. I got it for you.\"\t\"You've had it for twenty years.\" At least.\t\"I was trying it on.": "Erin",
  "What happened?\"\"I f***ed Titan.\"\"Ah.\"\"Actually, it was more like 'Yes, please, may I have another?": "Misty",
  "Humans don't leap buildings. Stuntmen with harnesses do. And won't my crashing eight stories to the ground be detrimental to the mission? The dark elves will swarm me and take me hostage instantly.\"\t\"That might be true, but you're not going to fall,\" he said.": "Amanda",
  "Yes,\" he replied. \"We are --- how do you say on Midgard -- between a hard place and tree.": "Amanda",
  "He kissed her softly. \"I think we both need time to get to know one another before we make love again. I don't want to rush things.\"\"But mating us so we're connected for all eternity isn't rushing things?": "Carrie",
  "Some things were only possible in fairy tales. And not the kind of fairy tales that Baba Yagas featured in": "those",

There weren't any manuals for this sort of thing....": "Carrie",
  "You scared the life out of me.\"\"Good thing cats have nine lives, then,\" she teased.": "Carrie",
  "He wouldn't grovel, wouldn't fall to his knees and beg forgiveness. He was the son of the Leo, the King of all lions. He would, one day soon, be the Leo and reign over his people. He couldn't fall for her more than he already had, but he could hope she could see how he felt.Because if she didn't, he wasn't sure what he would do next.": "Carrie",
  "Chewie gave a bone-scented sigh and rubbed his jowl affectionately against her leg. \"I can't tell you what to do, Beka. I can just tell you that I would be very sorry if you weren't my Baba. I've kind of gotten used to having you around.\"Beka blinked back unexpected emotion. \"Thanks, Chewie. That's really sweet.\"He was quiet for a moment, and then said. \"You know what's really sweet? S'mores, that's what.\" He gazed up at her with an innocent expression. \"Just sayin'.": "Deborah",
  "Er, hello, Chewie,\" he said politely.\"Woof,\" the dog said back.\"Chewie is a Newfoundland,\" Beka explained. \"They're great water dogs. They swim better than we do, and even have webbed feet. They're often used for water rescue, and the breed started out as working dogs for fishermen.\"\"Uh-huh... Chewie - I guess you named him for Chewbacca in Star Wars. I can see why; they're both gigantic and furry.\"Beka giggled. \"I never thought of that. Actually, Chewie is short for Chudo-Yudo. Also, he chews on stuff a lot, so it seemed fitting.\"\"Chudo what?\" Marcus said. The dog made a snuffling sound that might have been canine laughter.\"Chudo-Yudo,\" Beka repeated. \"He's a character out of Russian fairy tales, the dragon that guards the Water of Life and Death. You never heard of him?\"Marcus shook his head. \"My father used to tell the occasional Irish folk tale when I was a kid, but I'm not familiar with Russian ones at all. Sorry.\"\"Oh, don't be,\" she said cheerfully. \"Most of them were pretty gory, and they hardly ever had happy endings.\"\"Right.\" Marcus looked at the dog, who gazed alertly back with big brown eyes, as if trying to figure out if the former Marine was edible or not. \"So, you named him after a mythical dragon from a depressing Russian story. Does anyone get eaten in that story, just out of curiosity?\"Chewie sank down onto the floor with a put-upon sigh, and Beka shook her head at Marcus. \"Don't be ridiculous. Of course people got eaten. But don't worry. Chewie hasn't taken a bite out of anyone in years. He's very mellow for a dragon.": "Deborah",
  "The boy stuck his hand out politely and shook hers, then extended it to Fergus, his eyes bright as stars in the night sky. \"That's cool,\" he said, looking down at Fergus's hand and turning it sideways so he could get a better look. \"You have little webs between your fingers. Does that hep you swim?\"Marcus cleared his throat, looking embarrassed. \"Tito, dude, it's not polite to comment on people's, um, oddities.\" He shrugged an apology at Fergus, who just laughed.\"I do not mind,\" Fergus said, grinning at the dark-skinned boy. He leaned down and whispered. \"Can you keep a secret? I am actually a Merman from an undersea kingdom; that is why I have webs between my fingers.\" He held up one bare foot and said in a more normal tone, \"Toes, too, see?\"Tito's face was a study in conflicting awe and disbelief. \"I never heard of a Merman,\" he said, dubiously. \"I thought there were only Mermaids. And they're made up.\"Fergus snorted. \"If you do not have any Mermen, how would get more Mermaids, eh?": "Deborah",
  "Telling a male lion not to be a lion wasn't exactly the easiest thing in the world.": "Carrie",
  "Marcus gave her a slow, wicked smile, feeling the smoldering heat rise to the surface like molten lava, irresistible as a force of nature. \"If you insist,\" he whispered, and bent his head to capture her lips with his own. He put all his yearning, all his gratitude for the gifts she'd given him, all that heat bubbling up within him into the kiss, feeling her lips yield beneath his.She returned his fire with fire, kissing him back with a wild abandon that left them both trembling and enraptured, wrapped around each other in the midst of a crowd, focused only on each other.Overhead, fireworks lit the sky, but neither of them noticed.": "Deborah",
  "You know, sometimes love can be staring you right in the face, and you can be too blind to see it.": "D.F.",

  "She'd been the one to push him away this time, yet it hurt just as much as it had before. The door clicked closed behind him, and she gasped out a sob, her body shaking. Why had she said what she'd said? Why had she pushed him away like that?It made no sense. The only thing she wanted was to wrap her arms around him and never let him go.And that was why she didn't do it.Because once she did, she'd never let go. And she wasn't sure she'd survive if she had to watch him leave her again.": "Carrie",
  "Hello, lover,\u201d whispered a sexy feminine voice in his ear as hands wound around him from behind.Talin smiled, unable to help himself. He looked over his shoulder at Neve. She raised a black brow, her silver eyes searching his.Desire struck him quickly, making him instantly hard. Neve managed to bring such a reaction from him every time he heard her voice, felt her touch, or looked at her.": "Donna",

  "I'm Kyran. I'm usually the one who keeps him in line,\" he said as he motioned to Talin.\tThat made Neve's smile widen. \"You need to keep a better eye on him.\"\t\"I know,\" Kyran replied wryly.": "Donna",
  "Where she ended, he began.": "Donna",
  "The carnal way their bodies slid against each other, the decadence of how he felt moving inside her made her blood race and her heart swell with love.\tBecause he was hers.\tAnd she was his.": "Donna",
  "For Death's life to be extinguished... now that was something to truly dread.": "Donna",
  "The Light Fae. As a race, they were supposed to be all about good and decency, but there wasn\u2019t a shred of either emotion within the walls of Usaeil\u2019s castle.Neve observed Talin examining everything around him \u2013 from the castle, the Fae walking outside, the trees, and even the sky. His pale silver eyes missed nothing. She wondered what he saw, and how he catalogued things.His long, black hair had the barest hint of a wave to it as it hung to the shoulders of his pale blue shirt. He shoved one side behind an ear and tilted his head as if listening.She didn\u2019t think he realized she was still beside him, not that she minded. It gave her a chance to fill her gaze with his sharply chiseled features.The hard planes of his jaw and chin were in direct contrast to his wide lips and thick eyelashes. It was difficult to look at Talin and notice anything but those beautiful eyes.Except when she did look down, she saw a body that made her hands itch to touch him. His shirt barely contained wide shoulders that tapered to narrow hips where navy pants encased his legs. Every muscle was honed and defined.As eye-catching as Talin\u2019s personal package was, it didn\u2019t hold a candle to what drew her interest \u2013 his bearing. The way he stood, walked, talked.In a castle full of Light who believed themselves above others, the only one who had the attitude and demeanor to carry it off was Talin.": "Donna",
  "I nodded to Sam. \"I'll just clean up these boxes and meet you out on the floor.\" Macy's didn't mess around their shoe department in New York. It spanned two floors, and it was always busy.\t\"Okay,\" she relented. \"If you're not out in ten minutes, I'm coming back to find you.\"\t\"Got it. I was relieved when she finally walked out of the stock room. I wanted to forget this craziness had ever occurred.\t\tTom bent over to help me as I gathered up the errant shoes. \"Dude,\" he said, \"can I touch your arm?

  "Fen looked mildly amused by my antics. In fact, he was just short of full-on laughing. \"Don't snicker at me, wolf. Being naked in your arms...\" As I said those words out loud, a kernel of heat seared through me, heat that had nothing at all to do with the scalding temperature of the water. \"Well... let's just say it surprised me, okay? I wasn't expecting to be ... unclothed or ... alive, for that matter.\"\t\"Valkyrie, your nakedness does not bother me in the least.\" Did his eyes just flare a teensy bit? \"It would've been counterproductive to heal you with your clothes on.

  "My name is Phoebe Meadows.\" I covered my nakedness again with my arms. \"I know it's a little late for this, since I'm currently lying butt naked in your arms, and you've already saved my life three times, but now is better than never. You can call me Phoebe if you like.": "Amanda",

  "What do you mean 'has to be?' and what are you smiling at?\" I stopped contributing to this ridiculous dance. I grabbed the teapot and began to fill it with water in the sink.

  "Barbara felt lightheaded, almost dizzy with what she was about to say. But she said it anyway. \"As you wish, Your Majesty. In that case, I am afraid I must resign my position as Baba Yaga. If I am forced to choose between the work I was destined to do and the man I was destined to love, I choose the man.": "Deborah",
  "His jaw clenched and he wanted nothing more than to shake sense into her. Or just kiss her and give her as many damn orgasms as it took for her to see reason.": "Katie",
  "Anyone who discounts you is a dumbass,\" I muttered as the golf cart jerked forward.\"And are you a dumbass?\" the Pigeon inquired as she peeked under the tarp.\"Absolutely not...I'm a smartass.": "Robyn",
  "I don't put bad people in the Void, Blayne. Only the guilty ones.": "Caroline",
  "I know you want me, Jenner,\" Bria said in a breathy tone. \"Why don't you do something about it?": "Kate",
  "This is mine,\" he growled, fangs bared. \"You are mine.\"Bria met him stare for stare. \"Prove it.": "Kate",
  "What\u2019s the worst that could happen?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t say that!\u201d Bess and Corwin yelled at the same time.\u201cYou two are so superstitious.": "Georgette",
  "I don't want you two hurt because of me.\"...\"At least try, sweetling. Please.\" At her slight nod, he did what came natural and lowered his head. She gasped into his mouth, and he pressed his lips to hers. The electric shock between them only pushed him to kiss her deeper....\"I think I can try if you're going to keep kissing me like that,\" she finally said, and he grinned.": "Carrie",
  "As soon as she was ready for work, she called out to Eric's closed door. \"Anything in particular you want for breakfast?\"\t\"Yeah,\" he said, heading for the door. \"But I don't think it's on the menu.": "Terry",
  "They toasted each other, then after she sipped hers, she ate some of the bisque - creamy, a little buttery, with lots of big chunks of lobster and a hint of garlic. It was so good that she asked him for the recipe. He gave it to her and added,\" But I'll fix it for you anytime.": "Terry",
  "His mouth was on hers, the champagne flavoring his tongue and lips, his sexy scent reaching her over the warm, bubbling water. She stroked his arms, loving the feel of his mouth against hers, hot and hungry. Just like hers was, unable to get enough, not wanting to give this up, wanting to kiss him until the sun rose in the morning.": "Terry",
  "Time changed in an instant. One minute, you\u2019re drinking a beer with your friends, talking about the increasingly scary storm outside; the next, you\u2019re flying through the air with your body slamming into the nearest wall when lightning strikes. Or rather, when lightning strikes inside the room and hits you and six of your friends dead center.Eliana Sawyer\u2019s life changed the moment she felt the energy of the gods ricochet through her body. The world as she knew it became grey, and the things that went bump in the night became all too real. The paranormal world wasn\u2019t that of fiction anymore; now, she lived it. The way she saw the world, the way she saw life and fate changed. She couldn\u2019t plan a future the same way she had. She couldn\u2019t fall in love the way she\u2019d thought to in the past.After the lightning strike, six of her friends had found out the hard way what happened when they fell in love with someone paranormal\u2014they became paranormal themselves.Now, years later, here Eliana was\u2014alone, all too human, and on the outside looking in.Of course, she wasn\u2019t that alone anymore. She never would be again. While her friends had fallen for angels, demons, dragons, and wolves, she\u2019d fallen for a mere human. A human that had taken her heart and shattered it into a thousand pieces, all the while leaving her with nothing but an echo of what he had once been, what they had once been together.That wasn\u2019t the only thing he\u2019d left her with.He\u2019d also left the life currently growing in her womb.": "Carrie",
  "So,\" Tristan said with an odd grin. \"This is my home.\"Seth looked at Armara, who blinked at him. \"It's ...big,\" Seth said slowly.Armara laughed quietly and bumped her should against his arm. \"It is that.\"...Tristan snorted and shook his head. \"I'd make a joke along the lines of, 'well if you think this is big,'\"...Nothing like a dick joke to bring people together.": "Carrie",
  "Sitting in a bar for hours on end wouldn\u2019t help matters, but Tristan Archer figured he might as well try it out. It may take him far longer to get drunk than it would if he were human, yet he figured he\u2019d give it a go. After the hellish few months he\u2019d had, he would try anything at this point.He ran a hand through his short, auburn hair that tended to look brown in the bar\u2019s lighting and sighed. He shouldn\u2019t have accepted his friend Levi\u2019s invitation to dinner and drinks at Dante\u2019s Circle in the human realm. He should have rejected the offer and gone back to the thousand other things he had to do within the fae realm and inside the Conclave.Tristan wasn\u2019t just any fae. He was a nine-hundred-year-old fae prince with responsibilities that lay heavily on his shoulders. He was also a Conclave member, where he helped govern every paranormal realm in existence with another fae member and two others from each race. That was how he\u2019d become friends with Levi, a wizard and prince in his own right.So here he was, in Dante\u2019s Circle, a bar owned and named after a royal blue dragon; the meeting place of seven women and their mates with a history he couldn\u2019t immediately comprehend.Of course, it was because one of those women that he\u2019d rather be in the fae realm instead of the dark bar with oak paneling and photos on the walls that spoke of generations of memories and connections. He\u2019d been here a few times in the past, always on the outside of the circle of lightning-struck woman and their mates, but never fully excluded.They\u2019d welcomed Tristan into their fold, even if they didn\u2019t understand why it hurt him so to be that close to what he couldn\u2019t have.Or maybe they understood all too well. After all, one of their own was the reason for his confusion, his torture. The object of his desire.\u201cIf you keep glowering at her over in the corner, you\u2019ll end up scaring her more than she already is,\u201d Seth said from his side.Tristan closed his eyes and took a deep breath, immediately regretting the action as soon as he did. The man next to him smelled of the sea. And hope. His heart ached and his dick filled.Seth Oceanus was a merman, a friend, and his mate.His true half.Or at least one of them.Not that he or Seth could do anything about it when the other part of their triad didn\u2019t feel the same way.": "Carrie",
  "No, it\u2019s fine. I know you\u2019re late. Maybe we can talk tomorrow, but I\u2019m going to be in and out all day.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s what he said,\u201d she purred.": "Dannika",
  "She was the last lightning-struck without a mate, and therefore, human.": "Carrie",
  "Pain is mostly mind over matter: if you don't mind, it doesn't matter.": "Deborah",
  "Sweetheart, no one needs coffee, I just like the taste. Almost as much as I like the way you taste.": "Katie",
  "My face flushed scarlet. I was a stranger in my own skin. I had ever felt this kind of anger in my life. Fort and confusion grew. Its sensation was an overwhelming concoction of hate. The only things I knew - the only things keeping me remotely calm- was the following litany.My name is Eleanora Ada Stone. I was moved from home to home for seventeen years. I am now living on this god-forsaken island in Maine. I was being kept from a world of secrets. I have abilities. I am not human. I do not know what I am.": "Jes",
  "That dress makes me want to do bad things to you.\"\tThere was a long pause in which her sweet honeysuckle scent grew, twisting around him. Finally she spoke, her voice low. \"What kinds of things?": "Katie",
  "What do you mean 'has to be?' and what are you smiling at?\" I stopped contributing to this ridiculous dance. I grabbed the teapot and began to fill it with water in the sink.Suddenly I felt the slight weight go this body against my back and the corner of his mouth brushed adjacent my ear.\"How human you are,\" he whispered.": "Jes",
  "Uh, hi,\" she said, lifting a hand in greeting.\t\"Hi yourself,\" Liam said, feeling remarkably calm, under the circumstances. \"Did you just walk out of that closet?\" He looked her over, taking in her unusual attire, jewels, sword, and all. She looked exotic, stunningly beautiful, and in some intangible way, more herself than he'd ever seen her.\t\"Nice outfit. Special occasion?\" He was fairly certain she hadn't just come from a costume ball. Unless it was one that involved some kind of giant pumpkin and a fairy godmother.": "Deborah",
  "She certainly hadn't planned to sleep with anyone. But Mr. Tall, Dark, and Sexy had approached and it had been over for her.": "Katie",
  "I love you,\" he said, holding her close and running his fingers through her tangled hair as if he couldn't believe she was still in his arms. \"I think you've cast a spell on me, wicked witch that you are.\"\tBaba thought that if this is what it meant to be wicked, she was all for it.": "Deborah",
  "Dragons loved treasure, that was not a myth about his kind, and Rhea was the greatest treasure of all.": "Katie",
  "What do you envy?\"\tLiam gestured around the Airstream. \"All this. You travel around the country , no roots, no ties, having all sorts of adventures and meeting new people. It must be nice not to constantly have folks tugging at you, expecting you to solve all their problems for them, knowing everything about you down to whether you wear boxers or briefs.\"\tBaba raised an eyebrow, and he flushed a little.\t\"Briefs. But that's not my point.": "Deborah",
  "You were thinking about the hunky sheriff. I don't blame you. If I weren't a dragon, and a male one at that, I'd be drooling over him myself.\" He lifted his muzzle to look at her. \"So what are you going to do about him?\"\tBaba sighed. \"Probably something truly unwise.\"\t\"Excellent,\" Chudo-Yudo said. \"About time. No one should be wise all the time. Not even a Baba.": "Deborah",
  "It's about damned time,\" he said in a husky voice. \"If I had to wait five more minutes to kiss you, I think I probably would have turned into a dragon myself.": "Deborah",
  "So, Sheriff,\" she said. \"How do you feel about a life of crime?": "Deborah",
  "She'd seen what was between his legs and she wasn't ashamed to admit she wanted to see it again. More than just see it. Touch and taste would be a good start.": "Katie",
  "I do want you. More than my next breath.": "Katie",
  "Stu looked over his shoulder at the trailer. \"She seems like a nice old lady, but jeez, that's a big dog.\"\t\"Yes,\" said Liam. \"But a small dragon.": "Deborah",
  "The most possessive part of Conall didn't want another male to even look at Rhea.": "Katie",
  "I feel like my life started the moment I met you,\" he murmured.": "Katie",
  "Bang, bang, bang. On it continued, the knocking incessant and aggravating.\tConall growled, baring his canines as if ready to attack. She felt the feral dragon rippling under the surface, felt the exact same way right now.\t\"Someone better be dead,\" she muttered.\t\"I can arrange that.\" By his dark expression, she didn't think he was kidding.": "Katie",
  "I have a present for you,\" he murmured, still stroking along her spine. He loved the way she felt curled against him. Like she'd been made for him.\tLaughing lightly, she laid her head back on his chest. \"Pretty sure you just gave it to me.": "Katie",
  "One night of hot sex should have been easy enough to forget, but she couldn't get the images of their intertwined, naked bodies or his intoxicating scent out of her head.": "Katie",
  "Liam jumped. \"Jeez --you can talk!\"\tChudo-Yudo rolled his eyes. \"Right. So a talking dragon is okay, but a talking dog freaks you out? Dude, you're going to have to adjust to this crap a lot faster than that if you're going to be any help.": "Deborah",
  "Mrs. Ivanov's gentle face was pale and bewildered, her wrinkles falling in on themselves as though they'd given up trying to hold on to any expression other than sorrow.": "Deborah",
  "He quirked a brow. \u201cWhat the hell are you playing at, anyway?\u201dShe lifted her chin. \u201cCamouflage.\u201d\u201cDeus, woman.\u201d His gaze raked down her body. They were in a bar full of shifters one inch away from a full-out brawl, but damn if that hot, dark look didn\u2019t send a thrill shooting straight to her womb. \u201cIf that\u2019s camouflage, then I\u2019m king of the faeries.": "Rebecca",
  "Don\u2019t worry, I\u2019m the business expert here, and when I make my first million, I\u2019m going to sue those werewolves\u2019 asses off,\u201d Priscilla said cheerfully.\u00a0 \u201cThey\u2019ll have no ass left. They\u2019ll be ass-less. They\u2019ll look ridiculous.": "St.",
  "I\u2019m brutally honest.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cNo kidding. Sometimes a little too honest. There\u2019s this word called tact, it\u2019s in the dictionary under the letter T.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t believe you, I think you just made that word up.": "St.",
  "And now,\u201d he said, \u201cYou\u2019re all sticky. You really need a shower. I happen to have a shower.\u201d\u201cYou do?\u201d her voice rose in a squeak.\u201cYes, I do. And if you\u2019re wondering if that was just a transparent excuse to get your clothes off, then yes, it was. Because I really want to fuck you. I\u2019m sorry, was that too crude?\u2019\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u201cOh, no.\u201d Her voice was faint, and her heart hammered against her chest. \u201cNot at all. It\u2019s just crude enough.": "St.",
  "Oh my,\" she said as though to herself. \"The rumors are true, you have been kept in the dark.": "Jes",
  "Warm lips met her shoulder where he placed a light kiss. \"Doona be afraid of me. I'll always protect you.\"\tKinsey moved back against him, allowing her shoulder to rub against his bare chest. Heat radiated from him, cocooning her in everything Ryder.": "Donna",
  "Only light comes out of darkness,\" she whispered.": "Donna",
  "Don't blink. Don't even blink.\" she whispered.\"What in the hell are you talking about?\" Aiden looked around trying to identify a hidden threat.\"You blink and you're dead.\" Meryn stared at the two large stone angels on either side of a heavy looking wooden door unblinking. Aiden's hand went to his sidearm.\"Meryn, that is just a statue.\"\"But what if it isn't? I mean up until this week I didn't think paranormals existed and now you're all over the fucking place. I can't take the chance.": "Alanea",
  "Do you always drink from a glass?\" she finally exploded. Gavriel shook his head. \"Over my lifetime, I have fed in nearly every way imaginable. Drinking from a glass is tame is comparison.\" Meryn started to grin. \"Would you drink from a man?\" Gavriel nodded. \"Would you drink in a van?\" she asked, her eyes dancing. \"I don't see why not,\" he replied. Elizabeth stared as Meryn continued. \"Would you drink from an actor?\" Again, Gavriel nodded. Laughing, Elizabeth shook her head at Meryn. \"Would you drink on a tractor?\" Meryn could barely get the words out she was laughing so hard. Gavriel frowned. \"Maybe from a farmer if the need were dire.": "Alanea",
  "What man didn't enjoy a beautiful woman curled up in his lap, even if she did treat him like a scratching post every time she woke up?": "Paige",
  "Did you see that bison on the wall there? He\u2019s so big. And so cute.\u201dAngelo grinned. \u201cI thought you might say that. That\u2019s why I got a smaller version.\u201d He took the plush animal from inside his jacket, where he\u2019d been hiding it, and placed it on the table. \u201cThis is Ted.\u201dMinka\u2019s eyes glistened with tears as she stared at it. Crap, what had he done wrong? He\u2019d thought she\u2019d love it.But then she grabbed the toy in one hand, threw her arms around Angelo, and squeezed him so hard his ribs creaked.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said against his chest. \u201cHe\u2019s perfect.": "Paige",
  "Do you have any idea how beautiful you are?\" he asked hoarsely.\tMinka didn't answer. She simply reached up and tangled her fingers in his hair, urging him down for a searing kiss.": "Paige",
  "Angelo pulled his uniform overshirt over his head without undoing the buttons, which she thought was a pretty impressive feat. Then she saw what he was hiding under there and decided the view was much more impressive. Technically, he was still clothed, but the light tan T-shirt was really tight, and she didn\u2019t have to use her imagination very much to figure out there were a lot of muscles under it. Just the sight of his big arms rippling as he moved was enough to make Minka catch her breath.When he reached behind his head to pull off his T-shirt, Minka found herself licking her lips in anticipation. She felt bad for watching him like this, but she couldn\u2019t help herself. Then she looked up and saw Angelo regarding her with an amused expression on his handsome face.\u201cI understand why you want to keep the door open, and I\u2019m okay with that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut you might want to look the other way for this part.\u201dMinka felt heat rush to her face. She nodded and stepped out of the doorway, turning to sit down on the floor beside the bathroom like Angelo had done. Her fingers dug into the stuffed sloth\u2019s fur. She was glad he couldn\u2019t see her face because it was probably bright red. Why had she been staring like that?": "Paige",
  "I realized my sorrow, the regret of a restless, doomed spirit, rang in my voice. For the first time I wondered if my fate was to helplessly watch violence until I became as mad as the men who committed the murders.": "Christina",
  "She didn't know why being near him made the beast inside her go away, and she didn't care. She was Minka in his arms and a monster out of them. That was all that mattered to her.": "Paige",
  "What could possibly go wrong with faking love with a stranger on national TV?": "Zoe",
  "How can the daughter of an whore ever think to hold the heart of a King?": "Jen",
  "So what did you and Landon do this afternoon?\u201d Minka asked, her soft voice dragging him back to the present.Angelo looked up to see that Minka had already polished off two fajitas. Damn, the girl could eat. \u201cLandon gave me a tour of the DCO complex. I did some target shooting and blew up a few things. He even let me play with the expensive surveillance toys. I swear, it felt more like a recruiting pitch to get me to work there than anything.\u201dMinka\u2019s eyes flashed green, her full lips curving slightly. Damn, why the hell had he said it like that? Now she probably thought he was going to come work for the DCO. Even if he wanted to, he couldn\u2019t, not after just reenlisting for another five years. The army wasn\u2019t the kind of job where you could walk into the boss\u2019s office and say, \u201cI quit.\u201dThinking it would be a good idea to steer the conversation back to safer ground, he reached for another fajita and asked Minka a question instead. \u201cWhat do you think you\u2019ll work on next with Ivy and Tanner? You going to practice with the claws for a while or move on to something else?\u201dAngelo felt a little crappy about changing the subject, but if Minka noticed, she didn\u2019t seem to mind. And it wasn\u2019t like he had to fake interest in what she was saying. Anything that involved Minka was important to him. Besides, he didn\u2019t know much about shifters or hybrids, so the whole thing was pretty damn fascinating.\u201cWhat do you visualize when you see the beast in your mind?\u201d he asked.\u201cBefore today, I thought of it as a giant, blurry monster. But after learning that the beast is a cat, that\u2019s how I picture it now.\u201d She smiled. \u201cNot a little house cat, of course. They aren\u2019t scary enough. More like a big cat that roams the mountains.\u201d \u201cMakes sense,\u201d he said. Minka set the other half of her fourth fajita on her plate and gave him a curious look. \u201cWould you mind if I ask you a personal question?\u201dHis mouth twitched as he prepared another fajita. He wasn\u2019t used to Minka being so reserved. She usually said whatever was on her mind, regardless of whether it was personal or not.\u201cGo ahead,\u201d he said.\u201cThe first time we met, I had claws, fangs, glowing red eyes, and I tried to kill you. Since then, I\u2019ve spent most of the time telling you about an imaginary creature that lives inside my head and makes me act like a monster. How are you so calm about that? Most people would have run away already.\u201dAngelo chuckled. Not exactly the personal question he\u2019d expected, but then again Minka rarely did the expected.\u201cWell, my mom was full-blooded Cherokee, and I grew up around all kinds of Indian folktales and legends. My dad was in the army, and whenever he was deployed, Mom would take my sisters and me back to the reservation where she grew up in Oklahoma. I\u2019d stay up half the night listening to the old men tell stories about shape-shifters, animal spirits, skin-walkers, and trickster spirits.\u201d He grinned. \u201cI\u2019m not saying I necessarily believed in all that stuff back then, but after meeting Ivy, Tanner, and the other shifters at the DCO, it just didn\u2019t faze me that much.\u201d Minka looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cYou\u2019re a real American Indian? Like in the movies? With horses and everything?\u201dHe laughed again. The expression of wonder on her face was adorable. \u201cFirst, I\u2019m only half-Indian. My dad is Mexican, so there\u2019s that. And second, Native Americans are almost nothing like you see in the movies. We don\u2019t all live in tepees and ride horses. In fact, I don\u2019t even own a horse.\u201d Minka was a little disappointed about the no-horse thing, but she was fascinated with what it was like growing up on an Indian reservation and being surrounded by all those legends. She immediately asked him to tell her some Indian stories. It had been a long time since he\u2019d thought about them, but to make her happy, he dug through his head and tried to remember every tale he\u2019d heard as a kid.": "Paige",
  "Do you have any idea how maddening it's been envisioning you in the lingerie that matches those shoes?\"...\t\"Corbin, I'm serious.\"\t\"I'm sure you are but that is my final offer. Take it or leave it and if you chose the latter, I will let this home sit empty and fall into disrepair until you finally come around.\"\tI closed my eyes and sighed, \"That's really not fair.\"\t\"Anything is fair when I'm trying my level best to get you to fall in love with me....\"\tI kissed him gently on the lips and walked away from him but just as I reached the hall, I turned back to see him watching me. \"Oh, and if we're NOT playing fair, then maybe you should know I'm not wearing any underwear.": "Brynn",
  "Dark Fae are evil. They do evil things to each other, but there is an unspoken rule that you never harm family.\"\tShe held him tighter, wishing she could take away his pain with a hug. \"Families hurt each other all the time.": "Donna",
  "Kyran stretched his legs out and crossed them at the ankles. \u201cYou\u2019re needed, River. It\u2019s not by accident that you know what you do about the Fae and were put in our path. You\u2019re destined to aid us in this.\u201dWhen she didn\u2019t respond, he tried again. \u201cThink of all the innocents, like your family and Jordyn\u2019s, who were killed. You have a chance to help us put an end to such things for everyone. The half-Fae will no longer need to fear for their lives. And I promise you I\u2019ll figure out who has hunted your family and end it.\u201dHer resigned look cut through him. \u201cYou can\u2019t do that. You work for Death. I doubt you\u2019ll be given leave to help me.\u201d\u201cLet me deal with that. Whether you help me or not, I\u2019m going to find out why the Dark are hunting your family. And then I\u2019m going to make sure it never happens again.\u201dRiver swung her gaze to him. She tucked a long length of hair behind her ear. \u201cDo I have your word you\u2019ll stop whoever is after me?\u201d\u201cAye.\u201d Kyran held out his hand.River stared at it a moment before she leaned up and took it. They shook, her small hand in his. \u201cThen I\u2019ll help you.": "Donna",
  "Death's head cocked to the side. \"I can be very ... persuasive ... when needed.": "Donna",
  "Her eyes opened and clashed with his. Kyran had the insane urge to lean down and kiss her. Twice in a matter of hours. If he were smart, he'd put some distance between them.\tThen again, only a fool would walk away from someone like her.\tAnd Kyran wasn't a fool.": "Donna",
  "If you want me, take me,\" she dared him.": "Donna",
  "Kyran was a Dark Fae, but that's not what she saw when she loo9ked at him. She saw a man who was devoted to his friends and his cause. She saw a man who was haunted by his past.\tShe saw a man who made her think of the future.": "Donna",
  "The orgasm came upon her unexpectedly. It slammed into her with the force of a tidal wave. Her breath locked in her lungs as the climax swept over her, lifting her up and carrying her to untold heights.": "Donna",
  "As he stared down at River's lips, swollen from his kisses, there was no question she would be his. The fire within her matched his.": "Donna",
  "If a relationship crumbles in the universe, does anyone hear it fail?": "Cheryl",
  "Time slowed. He was thinking in colors and sensations now, not words. The curve of her breast. The shimmer of her skin. The way her breath caught when he touched her\u2014there.": "Rebecca",
  "Gabe ran his hand through his hair and suppressed sending an entreaty to God. It wouldn\u2019t do any good. The motley crew before him could only have been sent by the devil himself.His long lost sister, a hippie vampire, an angry Italian cop, and a tattooed man with no last name. It was as if Central Casting had thrown up its hands and sent over whomever had walked in the door.": "Cheryl",
  "I didn\u2019t argue. Anybody who that drove a Hummer and carried a Glock, let alone had the audacity to wear white after Labor Day, wasn\u2019t to be trifled with.": "Cheryl",
  "I will do what I must to protect you. If you were seriously hurt\u2026Don\u2019t make me live with that. Don\u2019t make me have to survive your death.": "Zoe",
  "There's more to life than...\" Her eyes darted to the shore where Shannon had found a decent place to film them. \"Jumping into the sack.\"\t\"Not much,\" he muttered. \"There's a lot to be said for a good fuck.": "Zoe",
  "He groaned and murmured, \"If I didn't think I was going to die, I'd have you right here.": "Zoe",
  "At the rate the Kings were finding mates, they were going to have to take turns eating supper because not everyone would fit at the table.": "Donna",
  "I woke in his arms and I knew I'd never be happier than I was in this moment. I watched his chest rise and fall as he slept peacefully next to me. As I relished in this tranquility, the sight of his body stirred me once again. My heart was attached and I knew I was ruined. It was a lesson I knew all too well, when you love, you hurt... they were two sides of the same coin.": "Brynn",

  "Erith,\" he said and bowed his head.\tHer blue-black hair hung to her hips in soft waves.": "Donna",

  "I watched the colored lights and sparkles coming off of Sebastian in the dark water, as the ocean began the process of rebuilding his tail. I longed to join him in the water, to wrap my arms around him and let him carry me under the sea; but I wasn't ready. For him, the ocean was a home; for me it was death. Without being able to transform, the ocean depths would suffocate me, the pressure collapse my bones and flesh.": "D.S.",
  "She looked Con up and down. ... \"I went to do your stupid ass a favor. Next time I'll decline.\"\tShe started to turn away when his hand wrapped around her arm to hold her. Rhi looked down at his fingers, then at his face.\t\"I doona trust you.\"\t\"You never have,\" she responded coolly. \"This is nothing new.\"\tHe yanked her close so that their faces were inches apart. \"If you betray us, there's nowhere you can hid where I won't find you. And kill you.\"\tShe smiled, briefly debating putting her lips to his and seeing his reaction. Right before she teleported away, she said, \"Kiss my grits.": "Donna",
  "She turned off all the lights in the duplex and peered out the windows, moving from one room to the next to see if she could catch sight of the a black sedan. Security lights and streetlights in her complex cast a strange orange glow on the misty snow. It looked like the perfect night for a murder.": "Terry",
  "He chuckled. She turned to see what was funny and nearly had a heart attack.\tHe was holding one hot-pink-and-white mug while reading it, the other sitting on the counter: 'Men should be like my curtains, easy to pull and well hung.": "Terry",
  "Wait\u2014what?\u201d He\u2019d said the last statement so casually, I almost didn\u2019t grasp its significance. \u201cThere are merrow who want to destroy the human race?\u201d I pictured a hundred thousand Sebastians, capable of punching through picnic tables and moving faster than we could even see them. It would be a slaughter. A mermaid apocalypse. I almost laughed at the thought, but the impulse died in my throat. I felt sick. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d wanted to kiss him just a few moments ago.": "D.S.",
  "I know you're more than fae.\"\tShe just grinned. \"It's true, I'm part fae, part awesome.": "Katie",

  "You\u2019re mine,\u201d he growled. He hoped she really understood that too. That she was his in every sense of the word. And vice versa. The female completely owned him. Until the day he died, he would be hers.": "Katie",
  "They wanted to stick her on a spit and roast her --- after doing some horrible things to her.": "Katie",
  "She watched him for a long moment, an adorably annoyed frown wrinkling her forehead. \"You're obnoxious when you're right.": "Katie",
  "It happened as it always did, swallowing her swiftly and completely. Intense. Painful. Quick, vivid colors spun beneath her eyelids. Sounds were sharp inside her skull. Fire shot up through her bones. She may have been screaming and she wouldn\u2019t have known. There was smoke in her nose, thick and black, and she couldn\u2019t breathe. It stung her eyes and licked at her skin. Wood and metal crashed down as skin blistered and popped and she knew this wasn\u2019t her, knew it was someone else, someone with a bigger body, bigger boots and darker jeans, and big ol\u2019 hands with scars on the fingers. Men\u2019s hands. Nails blunt and dirty with oil and grease and burning and- The cars were on fire. Paper burned and curled and rags ignited, the cement floor pockmarked by flash fires.

  "Uh...are we going to talk about what just happened?\" Victoria asked as Drake stepped over to Finn's desk to look at the map layout of the cemetery, seemingly calm about the fact that Bo and Nyx had just disappeared into thin air.": "Katie",
  "Drake, her sexy mate, just lifted a big shoulder. \"Bo clearly does not know how to act around his female. Once he figures out how to, they will be mated soon.\"\t\"No doubt,\" Finn murmured.": "Katie",
  "I smell?\"\t\"You smell...\" He flicked a glance at Bo, who was growling. \"You tell her then.\"\tBo's jaw tightened, but he looked at her with a rawness on his face that completely undid her. \"Like roses and sunshine. It makes them want to kill you or eat you or...\" He cleared his throat, not needing to finish because she knew what he meant. \"It's very enticing.": "Katie",
  "Even though she was terrified she'd somehow get Bo killed because he'd gotten trapped here with her, she was still glad to have him here. In that moment she realized there was no one else she'd rather have by her side.\tThat scared her more than anything because Bo was the one male she shouldn't want.": "Katie",
  "Do you realize that you gave me the best orgasm of my life and we haven't even kissed?": "Katie",
  "He pulled out a couple of mugs while she warmed up the cocoa. He chuckled and she turned to see what was funny and nearly had a heart attack.He was holding one hot pink and white mug while reading it, the other sitting on the counter: Men should be like my curtains, easy to pull and well hung.Her lips parted, she had to have turned cherry red, and she turned away quickly before she burned the cocoa. Now what? Explain that a friend had given them to her when her last boyfriend and she had parted company? Or just ignore the fact that they were drinking out of those cups while she was having hot cocoa with him and pretend she wasn\u2019t embarrassed to the tip of her toes?He brought the mugs over. \u201cAnything else?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s a can of whipped cream in the fridge, if you want some.\u201d\u201cReal cream,\u201d he said, eyeing the can. \u201cLooks good.\u201d He gave it to her, and he lifted the mugs.She shook up the can and pointed it at the right mug, pushed the nozzle, and the cream dripped and fizzled. Not to be thwarted, she shook it again, hoping that it wasn\u2019t defective. And then the whipped cream swirled around with perfect ridges in a twirl on top with a cute little pointy peak. Perfect.Then she turned to the other mug, shook the can again, and pushed the nozzle. It was working great until halfway through her little mountain of whipped cream twirling to perfection, when the nozzle malfunctioned again and spewed whipped cream everywhere.In horror, she stopped what she was doing and stared at the white cream splattered all over Allan\u2019s chest and a few that had dotted his boxer briefs. Her mouth agape, she glanced up at him.His eyes sparkled with mirth and he laughed.\u201cOh, oh, let me get something to wipe it up,\u201d she said, belatedly, and set the can of whipped cream on the counter.She grabbed some paper towels and wetted them, then rushed back to wipe the mess up. He was still holding onto both hot pink mugs of cocoa. She had every intention of taking one of the mugs and letting him clean himself, but he just moved his arms apart as if to say she made the mess, she could wash it up.She thought she was going to die. Yes, he was totally hot. And yes, she\u2019d fantasized about making love to him\u2014since they were both unattached, and she truly liked him. But in her wildest dreams she would never have imagined making him cocoa in the middle of the night in her duplex while he stood in sexy silk briefs, not baggy, but nice and form fitting, and then she proceeded to splatter him with whipped cream. All over his tanned chest and those black briefs.": "Terry",
  "What do you want for her?\"\t\"Dragon bones.\"\tThe leader's eyes narrowed even as his pupils turned to vertical slits.

It would be a slaughter. A mermaid apocalypse. I almost laughed at the thought, but the impulse died in my throat. I felt sick. I couldn\u2019t believe I\u2019d wanted to kiss him just a few moments ago.": "Derek",
  "Dude, we gotta work on your material. Hell, all you need is a little black moustache to twirl and go \u2018Muahahahaha\u2019 while you\u2019re at it.": "Tessa",
  "Aye, I loved you. I love you still. I'll always love you.": "Donna",
  "Banan gave her an appreciative once-over before he leaned close and whispered, \"Lovely gown. It'll look even better puddled next to the bed.": "Donna",
  "You want to give the biggest klutz who ever walked the earth a sailboat? I might run over someone.\"\"Just make sure they deserve it,\" he answered without missing a beat.": "Donna",
  "What would you say, Jane, if I told you the Dragon Kings had the ability to rule the world?\"\"I don't know.\"\"What if I told you they once ruled the world? What would you say then?\"She shrugged... \"I'd say you're a half bubble off plumb.": "Donna",
  "By all that was holy, he wanted to kiss every inch of her at least a thousand times.": "Donna",
  "With a grin like Banan's directed at her, for the first time in her life she didn't feel like a Plain Jane.And she had managed to walk to the car and get in it without incident. Maybe the day was looking up.": "Donna",
  "He's British,\" she replied in a whisper. \"He thinks he's perfect.": "Donna",
  "Each male dragon has one female, the other half of his soul, the light to his dark. She has been fashioned by the Universe especially for him. Dragons mate for life. Once we find our one perfect mate, there will be no other.": "Julia",
  "The guy's light eyes sparkled as he gazed at her, the weight of his body pinning Kade to the floor. \"Are you trying to get us both killed?\" His voice came out low, deadly. \"Or is this how you usually meet people?\" Glancing toward Kade's chest, flush against his, he smirked. \"Because I'm not going to lie...it's effective.": "Laney",
  "Who are you?\" she asked.\"A man who will do anything for another kiss.\"\"Just a kiss?\"\"Nay. I want it all, but I'll take whatever you give me.\"The world faded away as his head bent to her. A dark lock of hair fell forward and tickled her cheek. Hal's pale blue eyes ensnared her, trapped her. Captured her.And then his lips were on hers.": "Donna",
  "Almost as if speaking to herself, she continued, I would love to fly. I've always wondered what it be like to have that sense of freedom.A wistful note in her voice tugged at something deep inside him.He replied. I couldn't conceive of living without it. I can't imagine being forever grounded.": "Thea",
  "London was littered with social clubs and houses of chance, but Malfeasance was not just any gaming hell. It was located in the most notorious part of London and, Graydon had heard, was run by a pariah Djinn named Malphas.": "Thea",
  "He had not become a sentinel by worrying about what he should or shouldn't do. He would live or die as he always had, by making decision he knew to be right...Graydon didn't hide from life. He flew at it with everything he had.": "Thea",
  "He\u2019s hot. Too hot for me. Jeez, if he said the word sex to me I would probably pass-out.": "LeeAnn",
  "If you feel you must become a 'dragon man',\" she chuckled as she spoke. \"Then I will be by your side every step of the way.": "Julia",
  "Is bre\u00e1 liom t\u00fa le mo chro\u00ed go, anois agus go deo.\u201d \"And I love you with all my heart, now and forever, Manus O'Brien.": "Julia",
  "Eternity might be captured in a single kiss.": "Thea",
  "He closed his eyes. Swiftly like a predator, the vision of his death struck. This time it would not be denied.The white ground, black rocks, and red drops of his heart's blood growing on the ground like blooming roses. He lost himself in the sensation of liquid warmth flowing between his fingers.When he could finally see again, he found himself kneeling on the floor, shoulders hunched. That damned scene hung like an albatross around his neck, until he almost wished it would go ahead and happen, just so that he could get it the fuck over with.He had carried that albatross for almost two hundred damn years - exactly from the moment when he had responded to a damsel in distress and had embroiled himself in another man's curse.": "Thea",
  "Giving him a grateful nod, Graydon turned away.A heavy hand fell on his shoulder, causing him to stop in his tracks. Dragos' grip clenched, almost to the point of pain.Normally, Dragos was not demonstrative with anyone other than Pia and Liam. Moved, Graydon angled his face away. After a moment, he reached up to grip the other man's hand in return. Only then did Dragos' hold ease and allow him to continue on his way.": "Thea",
  "Placing his mouth next to her ear, he breathed. \"I want to be alone with my wife, Lady O'Brien.\" He felt the goose bumps rise on her skin and the shiver his breath caused.She let her head fall back and the lust-filled look in her eyes made him weak in the knees. \"And I with my husband, Lord O'Brien.": "Julia",
  "I don't believe I've ever truly appreciated flowers before tonight.": "Julia",
  "I have loved your daughter from the first time I saw her. We were young. I had no clue what love was, but over the years she has never left my heart. I know with all that I am, I can make her happy.\"The lord chuckled, \"I believe so too, son. Now all you have to do is convince my daughter.": "Julia",
  "Laurie picks up a briefcase and places it on the table. He opens the lid and his head disappears under the top. Oh god. Is he about to introduce me to a cat of nine tails, or some bizarre tickling stick? Brace yourself Liz. Cate told you to always carry your pepper spray, you fool.": "LeeAnn",
  "Elizabeth, when you look into the darkness you have two choices. You either fall into it, so you\u2019ll never fear the unknown again. Or you stay on the ledge, always wondering what\u2019s there. Torturing yourself over it. Elizabeth, I live in the abyss, and would like you to leap into the unknown with me. Will you join me?": "LeeAnn",
  "Watch out for your daughters.The man is coming.He\u2019ll promise you the world.But if you accept, there\u2019s no turning back.Watch out for your daughters.Because here comes Jack.": "Nancy",
  "Layla had always just been there. In my life. I wasn't sure who said, 'hi,' first, or maybe who smiled at who first\u2014all I really remembered was staring at her, and her staring back at me, neither of us looking away. Both of us standing frozen, and life falling into the background with a distant hum. As if the world had stopped spinning. Just for us.I remembered not caring if it had. She'd seemed so familiar, and even as a little kid, I'd known she was special. Like something bigger than me, older than me, had taken over my emotions in a way I didn't understand. She just felt like ... home. I could have gazed into her eyes forever. Happy to stand in that powerless state for the rest of my life": "Laney",
  "She paused and unexpectedly stroked her fingers down the feathers of his neck.He froze. She couldn't know how intimate that seemed, or how sensitive he was to her touch even through the sleek covering of eagle feathers. Pleasure at being petted ran down his spine.He should say something or step away. He did neither. Instead, ever so slightly, he leaned into her touch.It was wrong of him, but his wrong button seemed to be broken, and he didn't care.": "Thea",
  "I can't mate with you and hope to live.": "Thea",
  "Suddenly Hal burst through the nearby trees and came to an abrupt halt when he saw her. \"Cassie, are you hurt?\"He asked it so casually, as if he came upon women being held at sword point by nude men all the time.": "Donna",
  "He held the sword as if he's used one before,\" Rhys said.The stranger snorted. \"Of course I've used a sword. What kind of Highlander can no' wield a blade?": "Donna",
  "There are things about me I can no' tell you, Cassie, no matter how much I want to. Can you accept that?\"\"Are you married?\"He shook his head.\"Are you some kind of criminal?\"This time he gave a slight smile as he shook his head...\"Then I can accept it,\" she whispered.": "Donna",
  "The knight knew he was of good breeding and noble blood, that his reputation was sterling. He had no dalliances. He was a highly decorated Knight of the Round Table.": "Julia",
  "Even sporting a frown, his upper lip was full with a pronounced 'Cupid's bow' that inspired the image of her nibbling his tender flesh to manifest in her mind. At the thought, her cheeks heated with a blush she knew he saw by the smirk that lifted the corner of his mouth.\"What are ya thinkin' about?\" He winked, adding insult to injury where her pride was concerned.Taking a step back and turning on her heel, Abigail growled, \"I was thinking you have the manners of a stable boy but are dressed like knight.": "Julia",
  "Guy's only thought was to help her. It wasn't until he'd shoved aside the curtain and held her very wet, very naked body against him that he realized what he'd done.Her sage green eyes were wide as she stared at him. For long moments, they simply looked at each other.\"I heard you cry out.\"\"My... my ankle,\" she said after clearing her throat. \"I put too much pressure on it.\"\"A bath would have been better.\" He was valiantly trying to keep his gaze on her face, but it was difficult with her pert breasts against him and her bare ass beneath his hand as he held her up.\"Probably,\" she whispered.": "Donna",
  "Don't stop,\" she pleaded with swollen lips. \"Please, Guy, don't stop.\"The same hunger that ran through him had taken her as well. What kind of man would he be to leave her with such need?": "Donna",
  "Elena rolled her eyes. \"Oh, please, Guy. Everything immortal has to be killed somehow. I mean, you can't survive if they cut off your head.\"\"Want to give it try?": "Donna",
  "Writers are alphabet artists. The blank page becomes their canvas as they paint pictures with words.": "Barbara",
  "He grinned. \"Some guys like to work on cars or do woodworking. I search for beautiful women who might want to bite me.": "Paige",
  "Why don't we leave this pot on to simmer for a while?": "Paige",
  "Gage sighed. \"This team was a whole hell of a lot easier to run before any of us had ever heard about The One. You know that, right?\"\tMaybe.\" Becker grinned. \"But it wasn't nearly as interesting.": "Paige",
  "Sleeping with a guy isn't the same thing as opening your heart to him.": "Paige",
  "As engine vibrated under him, he tried to tell himself it was all going to work out. It had to. Now that he\u2019d found The One, there was no way in hell he was letting her get away. If that meant he had to move heaven and earth to find a good life for her and her pack mates here in the city, he\u2019d do it. If being with Jayna meant he had to empty out his bank account and sell everything he owned, he was okay with that too.He had friends in other places he could turn to, Family too. His parents owned a huge house and a lot of land outside of Denver. If he showed up with Jayna, her pack, and no job, his family would welcome them with open arms. Okay, maybe his mom would be a little shocked when she found out his girlfriend came with an extended family, but she\u2019d overlook it if there was a possibility of a grandchild in the near future.Becker was still daydreaming about kids with Jayna someday when headlights suddenly appeared in his rear- view mirror. He glanced over, swearing when he saw two vehicles speeding up behind him and closing fast.": "Paige",
  "He opened his mouth to order her to drop the MP5 she had aimed at him, but nothing would come out. It was like she'd robbed him of the ability to speak. Shooting her wasn't an option, though. And the idea of arresting her didn't make him feel any better.": "Paige",
  "Why aren't you turning me over to your cop friends right now?\" she demanded.\tHe shrugged. \"To tell the truth, I have absolutely no idea. But let's talk anyway.": "Paige",
  "The odds were incredibly stacked against a werewolf ever meeting his one-in-a-billion soul mate. There was no way Becker could have met his in the midst of an armed robbery. That kind of crap didn't happen in the real world.": "Paige",
  "Kissing her mouth, I plunged deep inside of her. I shivered and it had nothing to do with the cool breeze coming through the windows. Her body was made for me. Perfect. And I wanted this moment to last forever.": "Lisa",
  "You killed me.\u201d My voice was unsteady.He held me close again. \u201cI brought you back.\u201d\u201cPlease tell me we only have to do that once.\u201dHe whispered against my ear, \u201cI swear I won\u2019t kill you again. Cross my heart and hope to die.\u201d It was a bad joke": "Catrina",
  "I stared down into her eyes, my voice barely a whisper. \"If I stay here any longer, I'm not going to be able to stop myself from kissing you.": "Lisa",
  "Jared led me to the floor where I suddenly remembered an important detail. \"I don't know how to dance.\"\tHe didn't laugh at me. Taking my hand in his, he moved his other arm around my waist and leaned in close by my ear. \"Then you better let me lead.": "Lisa",
  "My mama always said, You can always ask. The worst they can do is say no. But I don\u2019t think Mama was thinking about revenge and murder when she dealt out that piece of homespun advice": "Catrina",
  "Don\u2019t worry about paying me. Stay alive, child. You must save yourself. And, whatever you do, don\u2019t forget who you are": "Catrina",
  "I put what was left of the ice cube into my mouth. Her lips parted, watching my every move. I didn't hesitate, diving back in to feed on my mate, my tongue cooling the fire and heating her desire all at once.": "Lisa",
  "A bedroom is not necessary for me to demonstrate my womanliness!": "Sidney",
  "You've got an empire to run, I'm just your arm candy.": "Lisa",
  "This zipper only comes down for you.": "Lisa",
  "I'd kiss you if I could,\" I whispered.\tJared's breath caressed my skin. \"I have other shirts.\"\tI smiled and kissed him.": "Lisa",
  "It's about your mom.\"\t\"She's not mad at your again, is she?\"\t\"No.\" I set the drill aside. \"\"In fact, I wanted to ask you for your permission to court your mom.\"\t\"You're taking her to court?": "Lisa",
  "I'm a pretty patient guy when it's something worth waiting for.": "Lisa",
  "Taryn? Are you all right?\" I nodded, pushing away the doubt. My fingers laced with his. \"I've never been swept off my feet before. Sounds a little... terrifying.\"\tHe laughed, and I drank in the sound. \"Terrifying is not what I'm shooting for.\" He kissed me, his lips caressing mine over and over until my pulse was thrumming, warming my whole body. He stared into my eyes. \"Breathless maybe...": "Lisa",
  "---\t\"That first day when we met, when I gave you my estimate for the deck project and you wouldn't shake my hand...\" I laced my fingers with hers. \"There was something sad and lonely in your eyes. I knew all about your reputation, your nickname the Ice Queen, but that wasn't what I saw that day. When I looked into your blue eyes, I saw a princess locked away in a tower, a prisoner. I wanted to set you free.": "Lisa",
  "I'm not hurting you?\"\tHe shook his head with a crooked, very sexy smile.\t\"Not yet.": "Lisa",
  "Almost forgot. Can you stop by and feed my fish every few days? And talk to them too. They get lonely when I am not home.\u201dCooper made a face \u201cWho the hell talks to their fish?\u201d\u201cMe. You\u2019ll feed them, right\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019ll feed them. But I am sure as hell not talking to them,\u201d Cooper said\u2026..": "Paige",
  "Each would treasure going to hell if it would keep the other safe!": "Sidney",
  "I felt absolutely nothing, and that frightened me even more than the darkness of oblivion": "Catrina",
  "Great, numbskull. Just bloody great. You've already managed to piss off the Queen. What's next on your agenda, setting fire to Disneyland?": "Thea",
  "For many minutes, we did nothing but touch each other and absorb the sensation into our skin, as if love itself were a tangible blanket wrapping us in an unbreakable bond.": "Juliette",
  "She was so wound up that she reacted before she thought twice about it and stabbed him. \"Damnit\" he said between clenched teeth. His fingers tightened around her wrist. \"Stop doing that.": "Donna",
  "The Light Fae had sacrificed so much for the Kings. She had been a true friend and ally to them in the past, but she was changing rapidly. Balladyn was chasing her, and it now appeared that Ulrik was as well. If her King didn't step up and set things right, Rhi would be lost to them forever.": "Donna",
  "He didn\u2019t miss them. He didn\u2019t miss any of his life, really, especially the last year. Time had simply been a bookmark. Something that held his place while he waited to finish the story.": "Mary",
  "She was so wound up that she reacted before she thought twice about it and stabbed him. \"Damnit\" he said between clenched teeth. His fingers tightyened around her wrist. \"Stop doing that.": "Donna",
  "I could forgive you anything but taking my memories. You stepped over the line.": "Donna",
  "They are like fucking roaches,\" Darius grumbled.\"The more you kill,the more you find.": "Donna",
  "I can't watch you die tonight.": "Zoe",
  "She wielded the ultimate weapon against him, his kryptonite - her touch.": "Zoe",
  "He'd been born into duty. As a demigod descendant, a death reaper, his first commitment was to serve the god of the underworld. Hades, as a conduit to usher evil souls to hell.": "Zoe",
  "Just this once, be the stubborn bastard I know. Don't die.": "Zoe",
  "You should've run faster, Lexi. You should've stayed far away from the Dark. But most of all, you should never have fallen for your Dragon King. It'll only bring you misery and death. Humans and Kings were never meant to mix.": "Donna",
  "She wanted to lick her way across the sexy lettering on his chest just to hear his breath catch and feel the pounding of his heart beneath her tongue.": "Zoe",
  "If I walked in there right now, you would beg me to make you scream.\"\"Oh, please,\" she said sarcastically.\"We wouldn't make it to a bed before I would be deep inside you.": "Zoe",
  "You don't have any weaknesses.\"\"I have one.\" He glanced at her.": "Zoe",
  "He crowded her against the wall. \"I'll fuck you until you admit there will never be anyone else who can bring you pleasure.\"A low and husky laugh erupted from deep in her chest. She trailed her hand down beneath his tuxedo jacket, over sculpted abs, to cup her hand around the hot length of him pressing against the tux trousers. She stroked him. \"Promise?": "Zoe",
  "Shall we take it slow this time? Maybe I'll make you beg me to let you come.\"\"I don't beg.\"He laughed wholeheartedly. \"We'll see about that.": "Zoe",
  "Games can sometimes be fun.\"He smiled and lifted his wineglass. \"A toast.\"She lifted hers. \"To dangerous games.\" He smiled.\"To winning.\" She clinked her glass against his.": "Zoe",
  "You are tougher to kill than Steven Seagal...": "Zoe",
  "He pushed a finger through the surface of the water to trace the outline of her mouth. Ethereal bits of flesh floated loosely about his knuckle and nail. Then, calmly, he pulled her body up out of the tub and into his arms. He placed his lips on hers, now as cold and dead as his own.": "P.J.",
  "I was going down and hard. There are a few things in life that suck really badly. Loving someone who doesn't love you back is one of them.": "Donna",
  "The sizzle I felt being near him was so intense, but I couldn't figure out if they were fireworks or warning flares.": "Donna",
  "I was flipping back and forth between do and don't quicker than they were serving up flapjacks down at the diner, he was getting closer to me.... close enough that I could smell him.... smell the heat that he threw off and that other certain energy that was pouring off of him right now at levels I'd not seen since Chernobyl. If I didn't move soon, I'd be in trouble... or ecstasy.": "Donna",
  "For all that my co-workers put such stock in not being a transfer, we had a definite edge in one area. As a human, you were born knowing that you were going to die.": "Donna",
  "We weren't a couple, but friends didn't spoon every night. Fate and I were officially in relationship-no-man's-land.": "Donna",
  "What? A big boy like you couldn't handle a little distraction?\"\"Little distraction? You had your hand on my cock and your tongue down my throat. I call that a pretty big distraction.": "Zoe",
  "She stepped back, staring up into my eyes. \u201cYou\u2019ve given me hope.\u201d She ran her hand up my chest. \u201cI don\u2019t know how to thank you for that.\u201dI grinned. \u201cYou can start by taking my calls.": "Lisa",
  "A shard of glass cut my belly as I slid into the battered SUV, but I managed to keep the family jewels intact. I\u2019d be counting every small victory tonight.": "Lisa",
  "Once we were on the road, I glanced at my passenger. \u201cIf you\u2019ve got any ideas about how I can get this shit storm cleared up, I\u2019m all ears.\u201dTank snorted, sneezed, and lay down on the bench seat, plopping his head on my leg. I rested my hand on his back, eyes glued to the winding two-lane highway. \u201cYeah, I don\u2019t have a goddamn clue either.": "Lisa",
  "My pulse pounded in my ears, heat smoldering deep in my belly. I\u2019d never been so tempted. \u201cThis is a dangerous game.": "Lisa",
  "His barely there smile warmed me. \u201cYou try really hard to hide behind that Ice Queen disguise, but that\u2019s not who I see. I see a girl who had to grow up fast, and a mom who would sacrifice everything for her son. You\u2019re beautiful, Taryn, inside and out, and I want to get to know the woman you keep hidden away.\u201d He lowered his hand and my body ached at the loss. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, I\u2019ll walk through the fire with you.": "Lisa",
  "Have ye ever known a female who wasna a bit of a witch in her own sweet way?": "Vonnie",
  "A bear! I've landed on a wild and wicked bear!": "Vonnie",
  "Do ye always drool like that? Is it a family trait, lass?": "Vonnie",
  "She placed her fingertips on her forehead as if trying to gather her thoughts on how to handle this unexpected scenario. \"Do not run from a bear. Make yourself a large target and yell to scare the bear away. Bears are easily frightened unless it's mating season.\" \"Oh, wouldn't it be just my horrible luck to fall on a horny bear?": "Vonnie",
  "Months ago, he'd told Effie, grandmother to his eldest brother's wife, that he was too busy to find a woman. He went on to brag he was quite happy being alone. That the only way he'd even consider a woman was if she dropped from the feckin' sky.He groaned and downed his first cup of coffee. Him and his big whisky loosened tongue.": "Vonnie",
  "What the feckin' hell is PMS, I'd like to ken?\"\"Petty Male Shit,\" she yelled.": "Vonnie",
  "Driving a stolen plane will be nothing compared to the ride with a fired-up Scot.": "Vonnie",
  "He was so damn hard, he could chip the ice from his truck's windshield with his rigid pecker.": "Vonnie",
  "I think...I shall call ye Beauty, for I shall be yer beast.": "Vonnie",
  "His head lowered as he brushed his nose against hers. \"Tell me to stop. Please, Lexi, because I can no' do it on my own.\"\tShe put her hands on each side of his face. \"Don't ever stop.\"\tHe issued a groan before he took her mouth again.": "Donna",
  "Have you asked yourself why you protect me? Are you as messed up about all this as me?": "Zoe",
  "He held his crotch, his knees bent and his kilt showing he wore nothing beneath it.She shuffled from one foot to the other as she stared at his Scottish bagpipe. Bet he could hit a lot of high notes with that thing. \"You...you startled me when you grabbed me like that.\"\"Well, ye needna be afraid now. I couldna molest ya, even if I wanted to, which I dinna.I'm betting foreplay with ye would be like grabbing hold of an electrical wire while sitting in a tub of water.\" He groaned and cussed some more. \"Hell, I bet yer vagina is lined with shark's teeth.": "Vonnie",
  "She leaned her uninjured shoulder against his plump, furry behind and shoved while she bitched to herself, \"Four years at the military academy, two years at Kansas State University, survival camp in the swamps of Alabama, more schooling in Florida, and then torture endurance training with the Mossad and all so I could heave a bear's ass into a helicopter. Unfreaking real.": "Vonnie",
  "The little woman, wearing a pink and black zigzag-striped pantsuit over a black turtleneck, resembled a skinny zebra who'd OD'd on Pepto-Bismol.": "Vonnie",
  "In all my years, there was only one time I felt fear. That's when I had to send my Clarets away. I never experienced it again. Until you.": "Donna",
  "The humans had killed a dragon here or there for food. Just as a dragon had killed a human here and there for food. The dragons had never been told there was a being on this realm that wasna to be eaten.\"\tLexi twisted her lips in revulsion.\t\"You eat nearly every animal on this planet, do you no'?\"\t\"That's different.\"\t\"Hardly,\" he stated.": "Donna",
  "Ye have taught me something I never understood.\"\"What? How to get rid of Parisian Pink Pecker Disease?": "Vonnie",
  "I'll help you, Ulrik, King of Silvers, if you'll help me,\" she purred and ran her hand up his chest.\tHe grasped her wrist, halting her arm. Then he bent his head until their lips were nearly touching. \"Shall we seal the deal with a kiss?\t\"I thought you'd never ask,\" she said huskily right before she put her mouth to his.": "Donna",
  "A love of the ages.": "That's",
  "Lexi glanced around the studio. She heard him in the bathroom. The door was slightly ajar, but she couldn't see him.\t\"A pity,\" she whispered.": "Donna",
  "Lexi looked him up and down and laughed. \"I'll fight every one of you. I'll make it my goal to slice off every Dark Fae dick. I'll make sure that you can't harm another human again": "Donna",
  "Look at me,\" she demanded.\tHe whirled around and held out his arms. \"What do you want me to say? Aye. I'm a dragon!": "Donna",
  "Tiago turned to survey the large, crowded ballroom. \"Good job not killing anybody.\"\"That's what Pia said,\" Dragos told him. \"Night's not over yet.": "Thea",
  "Do you have to take note of every little thing I do? I mean every tiny, little thing, Dragos?\"\"Yes,\" he said simply. \"When I look at you, even when things are going to hell, somehow everything is all right.": "Thea",
  "Jason lifted me up, and I wrapped my legs around his waist. His forehead rested against mine. \"I've never liked dancing.\" He started to sway with the music and the tide, turning us slowly. \"But maybe I just never had the right partner.": "Lisa",
  "Her dark eyes sparkled in the sunlight as she stared up at me. \"You are a moon child. She calls to you.": "Lisa",
  "I buried my fingers in her thick, silky hair. Her teeth brushed my neck, her scent filling my lungs, and I tightened my grip, growling against her ear. \"Dream come true.": "Lisa",
  "You're playing dirty,\" she whispered.\t\"Did you want me any other way?": "Lisa",
  "Against my mouth she groaned. \"I hate being quiet.\" \tA breathless chuckled escaped me.\t\"Me too. Once we're home...\"\t\"Lots of noise.": "Lisa",
  "You sure you don't want me to come over? We could make a snowman in the garden, or one in front of the hotel for the guests' arrival tomorrow. Or we could build snow forts and have a snowball fight. Surefire way to wear you out and make you sleepy. Then we could have cocoa with marshmallows on top. And I've been dying to have a piece of that seven-layer chocolate cake. I can't quit thinking about it.": "Terry",
  "Let me get this straight. You didn\u2019t feel it would be acceptable to enter my home without permission, but taking my clothes was just fine and dandy?\u201d -Marin": "Tracey",
  "Thank God I didn't have to see his smug face. Sometimes, I wished I had a pie that I could smash into it. Well, if by pie I meant anvil, then yes. I smiled at the visual. I really was sick.": "Emily",
  "Nope. Too Much,\u201d Marin said, and tossed the little man out of the hospital window. She needed coffee. Either that or a large dose of Thorazine.": "Tracey",

  "Mate. He\u2019d told Hayden he would stick to his routine. That meant watching the game at her apartment on Sunday and maintaining their friendship. His logical mind fought against his growing urges. Last night, he couldn\u2019t have a simple conversation without touching her. And she didn\u2019t make things any easier. He could smell the desire pouring out of her. It took every ounce of his self-control to hold himself back. At times, it was painful. \u201cI know what I\u2019m doing. I\u2019ve got the situation under control.\u201d\tCam laughed. \u201cLike you did yesterday? Dude, we both know it\u2019s only going to get worse.

He had to hide who he was from the world. A life with him meant Annabelle would have to lie to her friends and family about their relationship. He would never be able to marry her or give her the children she wanted. They\u2019d talked about her dreams for a white picket fence and a family. Even if she were willing to give up those things, wouldn\u2019t he be putting her life in danger? A dull ache formed in the pit of his chest. \u201cYou know that\u2019s not possible.\u201d\tIf he could somehow push away these human emotions of his, maybe he stood a chance of keeping her in his life.

Before he knew what was happening, he'd gone inside and sat down in the same booth he sat in now. And when she came to the table to take his order, she'd bit down on her bottom lip.

  "A rush of cold air blew against his face as he left her bakery. While he walked, Kaden tried to convince himself the date wasn't a big deal, but it was.

His brothers had one-night stands, not dates. There was no way he could ask them. They'd never let him live it down. Perhaps he could find the answer on Google?\tWith all he had learned since his arrival, he was confident he could figure this out.

I think he finds me irritating and a nuisance.\u201d Mac gave her a dubious look. \u201cIf you say so. But either way, you\u2019d better be careful. If being with Gage has taught me anything, it\u2019s that werewolves are extremely affected by certain pheromones. If you go walking around lusting over Xander, he\u2019s going to pick up on it\u2014 and so is every other guy on the team. Then things will get really complicated. I learned that the hard way. Those guys can pick up on arousal like it\u2019s barbecue and they aren\u2019t shy about letting you know it.\u201d Khaki groaned as she grabbed a plate from the cabinet. \u201cOh, God.

What do you think is going to happen to if all the guys on the team pick up on the fact that the one and only female werewolf on the team is aroused? You\u2019ll find yourself getting chased by fifteen out-of-control, horny werewolves going crazy with lust. And while there are some women who might find that entertaining, something tells me you wouldn\u2019t.\u201d Khaki set the plate on the counter with a thud. \u201cOh, crap.

Not only had it been six centuries since he had been in human form, but there was a war the Dragon Kings were involved in.Con and the others were waiting for him to join in the war. Every King had been woken to take part. After all the wars they had been involved in, Arian wasn\u2019t happy to be woken to join another.Because of Ulrik. The banished and disgraced Dragon King hadn\u2019t just made a nuisance of himself, but he somehow managed to get his magic returned.Which meant the Kings needed to put extra magic into keeping the four silver dragons sleeping undisturbed deep within the mountain. They were Ulrik\u2019s dragons, and he would want to wake them soon.But it wasn\u2019t just Ulrik that was causing mischief. The Dark Fae were as well. It infuriated Arian that they were once more fighting the Dark. Hadn\u2019t the Fae Wars killed enough Fae and dragons?Then again, as a Dragon King as old as time itself, they were targets for others who wanted to defeat them.For Ulrik, he just wanted revenge. Arian hated him for it, but he could understand. Mostly because Arian had briefly joined Ulrik in his quest to rid the realm of humans.Thoughts of Ulrik were pushed aside as Arian found himself thinking about why he had taken to his mountain. When he came here six hundred years earlier, it was to remain there for many thousands of years.The Dragon Kings sought their mountains for many reasons. Some were just tired of dealing with mortals, but others had something they wished to forget for a while. Arian was one of the latter.There were many things he did in his past when the King of Kings, Constantine, asked. Not all of them Arian was proud of. The one that sent him to his mountain still preyed upon him.He didn\u2019t remember her name, but he remembered her tears. Because of the spell to prevent any of the Dragon Kings from falling in love with mortals, Arian had easily walked away from the female.Six centuries later, he could still hear her begging him to stay with her, still see the tears coursing down her face. Though he hadn\u2019t felt anything, it bothered him that he had so easily walked away. Because Con had demanded it.Loyalty\u2014above all else.The Dragon Kings were his family, and Dreagan his home.

(with Reference to the character, Cain, from Dormant Desires, Book 4; CAIN.In the oddest, surreal moment, I look out and see one lone face. It\u2019s Cain, the chimera by curse and not birth. He\u2019s been welcomed into Demon-kind as one of them. Almost a treasured being for all his uniqueness. In all reality, he is the most divine among us. The product of an angel and a Neanderthal. A very son of the first Eve. It is he alone who is not prostrate before me. Our eyes lock and my vision goes wonky. I can see details and colors and etched outlines like I never imagined. I see Cain\u2019s magnificent aura as it embraces him like a full-body halo. He is watching the spectacle that is me with detached interest. It\u2019s as if he has truly seen everything there is too see and this is nothing more than a repeat of some long forgotten original episode. He is unafraid. I can feel how calm he is.

He needed to get her,and her car, far from this place so neither he nor Kate would beimplicated in any way with the gruesome murder site.It also meant he would have to drive.In all his years, he had never driven an automobile. The closest hehad come was watching various assistants through the years as theychauffeured him. He wasn\u2019t sure he could even remember how tostart the car, but right now he had no choice.Grudgingly, he got into the driver\u2019s seat, and finding the leverunderneath, he pushed it back so he sat comfortably behind thewheel. After trying three different keys, he found one that slipped intothe ignition.From what he had seen over the past hundred years, driving wasnot a complex operation, and he was an immortal with reflexes farmore keen than a human man.How difficult could it be?He turned the key and nearly jerked the wheel off the steeringcolumn when the car surprised him by lurching forward. The car wentsilent. The engine wasn\u2019t running. What was he doing wrong?He stared at the gearshift, wondering if he should move it. Hisfrustration reared up, but his agitation would not make the car driveitself. He had to keep a cool head.Not knowing what else to try, he pushed one of the pedals at hisfeet to the floor and turned the key again. This time the car didn\u2019tmove, and it roared to life. Grasping the gearshift, he jammed it intothe first position and glanced over at Kate.Why couldn\u2019t she have owned a car with an automatictransmission?Shaking his head, he put some pressure on the gas pedal andslowly released the clutch. Thankfully the car rolled a few feet, butwithout warning it jumped forward. He pressed the clutch back to thefloor before the engine lost power again.Calisto slammed his hand against the wheel, muttering under hisbreath in Spanish. At this rate it would take him all night to drive herhome.The faded yellow convertible pitched forward again, threateningto stall as he continued out of the parking lot, thankful it was late. Thestreets were fairly empty. At least he wouldn\u2019t get into an accidentwith another car.

  "He groaned, \"Goddamn, you're so hot.\"\"I know,\" she whimpered as she moved restlessly under his weight. \"I'm burning up.\"At that, he had to lift his head and grin down at her. \"No, baby,\" he said gently, rocking his hips to begin moving in her. \"That wasn't what I meant.

Pulling back, she muttered, \"Sorry.\"Incredulity sharpened his gaze, \"You're sorry?\"Her shoulders crept up to her ears. \"I just grabbed hold and started sucking.

Now that is the question.\tWynn took in the Guardian's human form and hoped her eyes were not literally bulging out of her head, because they sure as heck felt like they were.

  "Lynetta bared her wickedly sharp pointed canines and hissed. Her long black hair hung wildly to her hips, tangled and teased by the breeze. She was petite like me but as strong as a male body builder. Her grip on Dominic remained iron tight. Her soul-less black eyes, vacant and without a care, really ate away at my heart. I surveyed the yard for any kind of weapon I could use against the vampire. My heart surged when I spied a colorful whirligig attached to a wooden stake embedded in my mother's pampered pansy garden nearby. Without a second's hesitation, I dashed for it and yanked it out. Running at the vampire, I screamed at the top of my lungs, \"Death to the blood sucky vampire!\" which gave me some courage. It wasn't every day I had to beat one vampire off of another when they didn't even really exist!": "Terry",
  "A Guardian lover is the last thing you need, Wynn Myfanwy, she told herself sternly.\tToo bad it was the very first thing she wanted.": "Christine",
  "You know, in human society, it's considered impolite to molest a sleeping person. In fact, it's seen as pretty creepy.\"\tHis gaze shot to her face and found her regarding him through dark eyes heavy with sleep but lit with amusement rather than indignation. He felt himself relax slightly and continued to explore the fascinating contours of her calf and thigh. \"Then as you are now awake, I may continue without fear.": "Christine",
  "He wanted to claim her, to possess her and be possessed, to sink into her soul until neither of them could tell their own being from the other.": "Christine",
  "She tilted her head to glare up at him. \"There you go with the 'little witch' thing again. What did I tell you about that?\"\tKnox grinned unrepentantly. \"What can I say? You have bewitched me.": "Christine",
  "I do not doubt your intellectual or spiritual equality with me, mate. When I saw you belong to me, it is only because I belong so utterly to you, as well.": "Christine",
  "When he expressed his feelings for her - always here like this, while he touched her or made love to her - he used words of possession and passion. He told her they belonged to each other, that she was his, that he was her mate. And he made love to her like a starving man, as if he couldn't get enough of her.": "Christine",
  "She'd grown up hearing about epic battles between Guardians and demons, of legendary Wardens and their brave fight to keep the nocturnis at bay. To her, it all had the air of fairy tales, history through the lens of the Brothers Grimm. She listened to the tales the same way she listened to Beowulf, and had the same expectation of ever featuring in one of those famous battles as of facing Grendel's mother in a Scandinavian swamp.\tYet here she was, not just fighting the forces of evil but somehow tied to her very own Guardian, acting for all intents and purposes like the Warden she had once dreamed of becoming.": "Christine",
  "Her eyes scanned the room and spotted her cell phone lying on the coffee table at least three whole feet away from her hands. She groaned. This was when she didn't want to be a witch, she wanted to be a Jedi, so she could use the Force to make her phone fly right into her hand.\tWhat the hell, right? Lifting one arm she reached out an open hand toward the small electronic device. Use the Force, Wynn, she thought and had to stifle a slightly punch-drunk giggle.\tFrom his seat in the oversized chair, Knox eyed her strangely. After a moment, she gave up and dropped her hand to her side, rolling her head along the sofa cusions to meet her mate's gaze. \"What were just doing?\" he asked warily.\t\"Using the Force.\"\tHe looked from her to the table and back again. \"Did you do this successfully?\"\tShe shook her head and grinned. \"The Force is weak with this one. I'll never be a Jedi Master.": "Christine",
  "Why do you cry?\"\"I almost lost you...\"\"You cannot lose me, not when you are part of me...You cannot lose has become part of you.": "Christine",

  "I had always heard rumors of her, Nanook thought, she who can control the wind, the water, the earth, and fire ... she who can talk to time. But those were old myths of a woman who lived many thousands of years ago, the first daughter of the Earth. There is a prophecy that she will return again, during the end times -- every religion has someone like that, someone to wait for and put your faith in, but my culture had mostly covered up her existence. We had a god of the sea, a god of the land, a god of the air, a god of fire, but no one who could control all of the elements. We spoke, only in whispers, of the ancient bloodline -- the descendents of the Great Mother. Too many superstitious minds, too many men concerned only with their own power and position, had heard these whispers in the past and taken gruesome steps to erase the descendents. The lineage was said to be broken, the blood of the Great Mother spilled for the last time.": "Sarah",

His tanned skin and taut muscles tempted her, luring her to touch him. Turning around to give him privacy seemed like the right thing to do, but there wasn\u2019t a hint of modesty in this Mayan god, and if he could handle getting this personal, then she could, too.When he unzipped the wet pants, she held her breath. Would an ancient guy wear underwear? She was about to find out. He bent over to lower the wet slacks. When he straightened up, she realized he\u2019d been talking, but she didn\u2019t have a clue what he had said. Instead, all her attention was focused on a fine trail of dark hair leading from just below his navel and disappearing under the low-slung elastic band of his boxer briefs.\u201cMuriah?\u201dHer gaze snapped up to meet his. Thank the universe he couldn\u2019t read her thoughts. \u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cDid you hear my question?\u201dHe stood two feet from her in only his underwear, and he thought she was listening? He was either completely unaware of his sex appeal, or he was way too accustomed to being obeyed.Probably both.She cleared her throat. \u201cI must\u2019ve missed it.\u201dA spark lit his eyes that told her he might have more than a clue to his sex appeal.He picked up the T-shirt and pulled it on. \u201cI asked if you knew of another hotel closer to the airport so we can get out of New York as soon as the sun sets tomorrow.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m sure I can find one.\u201d She pulled out her phone, grateful to have something to pretend to focus on besides him tucking his package into the new khakis she pulled off the rack for him.\u201cI probably should\u2019ve grabbed some dry underwear, too.\u201d\u201cThey are nearly dry now. I will be fine.\u201d He popped the tags off, and she glanced up from her hotel search. \u201cThey\u2019re not going to like you taking the tags off before you pay.\u201dThe corner of his mouth curved up. \u201cThey will be honored to take my money.\u201dShe groaned and rolled her eyes. \u201cDo you ever not get your way?\u201dHe stepped closer to her, his chest an inch from hers until her back pressed against the modular wall of the fitting room. \u201cRarely.\u201d His dark gaze held hers, and the deep rumble of his voice sent heat through her body. \u201cBut some things are worth the extra effort.": "Lisa",

  "He kissed the cord running between her shoulder and neck, his teeth grazing the skin. Clamping her thighs together, she struggled to breathe through the wave of desire.

  "I shook my head, smiling in spite of myself, and gave him a kiss on the cheek. Adrian. My husband. If anyone had told me a year ago that I'd be married, I would've said they were joking. If they'd told me I'd be married to a vampire, I would've said they were delusional. Looking at Adrian now, I felt a surge of love well up within me, despite our earlier tension. I could no longer imagine a life without him in it. It was impossible. Could I imagine a life with him that didn't involve us being trapped in a suite of rooms with his mother while both our people reviled us and made plans against us? Definitely. There were any number of futures I'd love to have for us, but his was our current path until something spectacular happened. Outside, the Court's gates, my people wanted to imprison me. Inside them, his people wanted to assault him. At least in this suite, we were safe. Most importantly, we were together.": "Richelle",
  "We don't really have a song or anything.\" I pondered that for a second. \"I guess we've failed as a couple in that regard.\"She scoffed. \"If that's our biggest failing, then I think we're doing okay.": "Richelle",
  "Well? Are you going to crouch there and gawk at me or explain yourself?\"Instead of answering, the girl frowned and asked, \"Why can't i read you?\"A short disbelieving laugh slipped from Sherry, but when the girl simply stared at her with bewilderment, she said reasonably, \"Maybe because I'm not a book.": "Lynsay",

  "So, why are you in Biloxi?\" ...Bran didn't move, but there was a subtle change in him as he watched her. \"I thought the reason I was here was obvious.\"\"Do you mean because of me?\" Asking that left her feeling exposed even if she'd made it clear that things between them were just about having fun.\"I am here because of you.": "Katie",
  "Before she could move or even think, the male shifted to his human form. Bran stood there, all six feet four inches of sexy, pissed off male. His expression was one of pure rage as he stepped toward her. Not that this stopped her from checking out every single naked inch of him. And the man was built. All those hard lines and striations looked as if he'd been carved from marble.": "Katie",
  "I will not interfere with a male dragon while he is rutting.": "Katie",
  "I'm just sorry your dragon is so hell bent on mating with someone as fucked up looking as me,\" he murmured, keeping his voice light even though he wasn't joking at all. God, everything about her was perfect. It was no surprise she was so resistant to mating with him....To his surprise, she snorted and smacked his stomach. \"Bran Devlin, you're the sexiest male I've ever met. If you want me to stroke your ego you're out of luck.\"Then, to his utter fucking surprise, she slid her hand lower and grasped his already hardening cock before looking up at him. Her smile was an erotic mix of uncertainty and wickedness.\"But I don't mind stroking this.": "Katie",
  "She saw Bran step through the heavy gate. A big smile spread across her face at the sight of him.Unable to stop herself she drank in the way his broad shoulders stretched out his long-sleeved shirt and the way his thick thigh muscles flexed and strained under his cargo pants. The male was walking, talking sex and he was all hers.": "Katie",
  "He slid a hand over her stomach and down to her mound. He cupped it possessively and was pleased when she sucked in a breath at her unmistakable wetness.\"This is mine too.\"She swallowed hard again but didn't respond. More importantly, she didn't argue.But it wasn't enough. \"Say it.\" He needed to hear the words. Needed to know she wanted him as much as he wanted her.She held his gaze, stared back at him in the mirror, her eyes dilated with arousal. \"I'm yours.": "Katie",
  "Bran had heard his brother's mate Fia call Keelin one of the great beauties of the dragon race and it was true. Dressed in what he considered battle gear, Keelin was a wet dream come to life.": "Katie",
  "Since I was a very young thing, others have told me that what I think, and the things I like, and the ideas I have, are bad. This has always been very puzzling to me. I understand in theory what the problem is, but in practice? I\u2019m not compelled to change my ways.": "Christina",
  "I am a woman of very few layers, and most of them are selfish and mean. My parents tried to make me a good girl, but I just wasn\u2019t having it.": "Christina",
  "She sensed her own power to enslave him. He would come willingly enough. No filthy atheistic beliefs she held were strong enough to douse what was crackling in the brief space between them. It would satisfy her on a hundred levels, to bring him to his knees.": "Christina",
  "I had no idea you could dance so well.\" Larissa linked her arm through Aiden's as they left the local pub.A few drunk men stumbled out behind them, singing offkey as they headed in the opposite direction.\"You shouldn't be so surprised considering how well I dance between the sheets,\" he murmured, his seductive voice wrapping around her like a warm caress.": "Katie",
  "Hello little one. Did you know you're on private property?\"\"Really? I had no idea.\" Meryn fudged. He raised an eyebrow. \"The ten foot fence right behind you didn't give it away?": "Alanea",

  "His smile was small and immediate, crooked, like I\u2019d put his whole world off its axis, but he was somehow okay with that.": "Shelly",
  "He Looked down at her gravely. \"In many ways, we are the most perfect match. We see each other as we are, but neither of us views the other as broken.": "Sylvain",

  "Larissa's father was Vlad Dracul? Vlad Tepes?

  "Aiden whirled on the tall cowboy. \"What the fuck's your problem? Teresa looks like sex on heels so pull that stick out of your ass.": "Katie",
  "You wish for what's called wooing. This customary game, where the man shows the woman that resistance is impractical, strikes me as quite pointless.": "Tara",

  "When he was rough, my body soared. When he was gentle, he slayed me.": "Juliette",
  "I let myself feel everything. Just this once, I wanted it all. I let him push our passion to the cliff, let my body synchronize to his in perfect harmony. Just this once, I let more than my body fall over the edge. With him.": "Juliette",
  "Sweetheart, I'll lift my kilt and show you what I've got between my thighs and if you still think it's lit(tle) ---": "Katie",
  "I felt him closing in on me. My insides twisted and my cheeks grew warmer with his approach as if I could feel the warmth of his shower radiating off him.\"All of a sudden, you're quiet and shy? You're not your usual pain in the ass self. I know you came here for a reason. What did you want to yell at me for this time?\" he stopped just a few feet from me.\"Do you think you could put a shirt on?

She couldn't even think of a decent lie.\"To kiss Ryan?\" the boy asked, all innocence.": "Katie",
  "May the judgment of the dead find you justified.": "Charity",
  "He chuckled. \"Come here.\"\tShe hesitated.\t\"We don't have to do anything.

Prowling through the dense, tropical rainforest as a jaguar, she listened for the human voices that would clue her in that her prey was nearby.\tWaves crashed onto the sandy beaches in the distance as she made her way quietly, like a phantom predator, through the tangle of vines and broad, leafy foliage, searching for any sign of the poachers. Humans wouldn't have a clue as to what she and her kind were when they saw her - apparently nothing other than an ordinary jaguar. And she and her fellow jaguar shifters planned to keep it that way.\tHer partner on this mission, JAG agent Huntley Anderson, was nearby, just as wary and observant.

  "At his booming voice, her eyes flew open. If he wasn't already on the ground, he would have fallen to his knees. Sebastian was instantly lost. The ship fell away and there was only her.

  "He kissed her more thoroughly, more deeply, more deliciously than she'd thought possible. Everything vanished for her. Nothing existed anywhere else. It was only the two of them. Lost in a time and place where no one could see them or touch them or harm them. The world as she knew it didn't matter. Nothing was as real as the two of them in each other's arms, Hugh kissing her like he might die without her.": "Robin",

  "Never try to stop me again,\" he told her. It was a sensuous command of a lover and brought a chill of excitement in Mahgen's spirit, spreading throughout every inch of her body.\"No, Kathel,\" she said, \"if that is my punishment, I shall always try and stop you.": "Madison",
  "He was smiling that smile I truly loved.": "Heather",

  "The marine underworld stretched below the ship and embodied many secrets. The disappearance of Olga had become one of the mysteries that would remain with Stefania and her family.

They would sing shanties and talk of the constellations, the sea, its creatures, and the legends.

  "He's definitely not one for negotiation, no matter how hard I've tried.\"\"You try asking him naked?\"Tess choked on her Irish coffee. \"I beg your pardon?\"\"Men can't think straight when a woman's naked.

  "I write books that I want to read. I write books that feature curvy heroines because I'm a curvy woman myself and it gets tiresome to read books about skinny women all the time.

  "Take this message to your people, you obsequious little worm,\u201d I murmured. \u201cAnyone who lays a hand on Jordan Amador will have to answer to me. Now do me a favor and go to hell.\u201dI removed my sword from his hand and then decapitated him. His severed head tumbled across the floor like a wayward bowling ball. Good riddance.I set my sword aside, found a stool in the corner, and climbed up in front of Jordan. Her handcuffs were attached to a huge meat hook bolted into the ceiling. I lifted her off of it with great care, unsure if she had the strength to stand. As soon as her arms were free, she looped them around my shoulders and pressed her face against my neck. She was trembling, but not crying. I sank to the floor and cradled her in my lap, breathing out the last of my anger now that she was safe. \u201c\u2018M sorry,\u201d she mumbled in a small voice. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry, Michael.\u201dI snorted. \u201cWhat the hell do you have to apologize for? You got kidnapped. Pretty sure that\u2019s not your fault.\u201dShe shook her head, her words partially muffled as she pressed her face against my shirt. \u201cShould\u2019ve been stronger. I could\u2019ve gotten you killed.\u201d\u201cBy Heckle and Jeckle here? Not likely.\u201dA shaky laugh rattled through her. She slid her fingers into the hairs along the nape of my neck and hugged me tighter. I knew from experience she didn\u2019t want me to see her face because she knew she was only seconds away from breaking down. No one would ever accuse Jordan Amador of being a crybaby, not if she could help it. It was a ridiculous notion at best, but I indulged her anyway. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cJust doing my job. But you\u2019re welcome.\u201dI smoothed the sweaty hairs away from her forehead enough to kiss it. She didn\u2019t move away.

  "The first thing that went through Mahgen's mind was how cold she'd become with the loss of Kathel, how insane it was that things could go from tender and warm, to cold and indifferent, in the matter of seconds.

  "She brought her hand to his chest. His chiseled musclesresponded to her touch, and a moan escaped her as he clutched hertighter.

  "So tell me, Thais, you say all things happen for a reason. What if I never found you wandering in the forest that day?\" he asked.

  "Thais looked up from the book. For a moment he considered telling Kathel he didn't really see anything, but knew it would do no good to lie. \"The book recognized me.\" Honesty won out. \"Of course it did,\" Kathel said sarcastically. \"Does it want a kiss hello?\"-Madison Thorne Grey, Sustenance": "Madison",

  "That's it, I'm going to beat you down and make you sorry.\"Xypher froze as he braced himself for her attack.But instead of her giving him pain, she tickled him. It took him several seconds before he realized her intent. By then she was pouting.\"You're not ticklish. Well, that stinks.\" She sat back and crossed her arms over her chest, hiding the breasts he loved to tease.\"I'm sorry,\" he said, trying to cheer her. \"If it'll make you happy, I'll pretend to be.\" \"No it's okay. Can't have everything, I suppose.\" She paused at the edge of the bed. \"But you come darn close.\"\"Close to what?\"\"Being perfect. Only you're more than that, Xypher. You're wonde": "Sherrilyn",

  "Part of her wanted to comfort him, to tell him everything was going to be okay. But the rest of her just wanted to throw him to the ground and rip those jeans off him. Funny how she could be so jealous of a pair of pants. They covered the sinfully male body she longed to explore.": "Rosalie",
  "Simone couldn't move as she caught the hot look in his eyes. This was it and she knew it. She was lost to him.

You two continue.\"Xypher let out a low, evil growl as he hung his head down and shook it over her. \"I don't know about you, but that just killed my mood. The only thing to do more damage would would be to see Jesse naked. That would probably make me impotent for eternity. I think we just found the perfect birth control.": "Sherrilyn",
  "Hey, look who's alive! I knew you were too tough to leave this f@$#ed up place without a fight, and you do realize that if you had wanted to get into Wharick's bed, there certainly would have been easier ways to get there than getting yourself poisoned,\" He smiled widely.": "Madison",
  "Surrounding the two of them was the love they shared but also an overwhelming feeling of fear--fear of a future filled with the emptiness which would consume them if they remained apart. A fear of a future of being separated forever, and it gripped both of their hearts, demanding preventative action.": "Madison",
  "Dillan didn\u2019t just kiss. He slow danced. We moved in sync. I wanted to lose myself in him. In his touch. Right then the world seemed like such a perfect place.": "Kate",

  "The angel\u2019s lower body was covered by a pair of faded jeans that showcased the strong muscles in his thighs\u2026along with a few other things she\u2019d only dared dream about. His upper body was bare, showing off honeyed skin, washboard abs, and a killer set of pecs.": "Rosalie",
  "I'll thank you now, Kathel,\" Keirah whispered. Placing a simple, soft kiss on Kathel's lips, she turned and walked away toward her cabin, leaving both men stunned in her wake.": "Madison",
  "Xypher flashed himself into Simone's bedroom, expecting to find her there.It was empty.Closing his eyes, he sensed for presences in the condo. There no Simone, but Jesse and Gloria in Jesse's room.Without thinking, he flashed in there to find the two ghosts naked on the bed. \"Oh g-ds, I'm blind.\" He spun around to give them his back.\"Don't you knock?\" Jesse said.": "Sherrilyn",

  "Their eyes drifted directly behind her. At the same time she felt the presence of a rather large, imposing figure, then the sudden heat permeated the air around her. He's behind me, isn't he?": "Madison",
  "Without even thinking about it, she reached out for warmth, reached out for acceptance. She was hurt and as much as she tried to build up the wall of protection and never let anyone in again, Wharick had changed her building capabilities. Wharick had changed her heart.": "Madison",
  "Even though he knew both of their hearts were taken by others, he recognized beauty when he saw it and appreciated it as any male would.": "Madison",
  "Kathel, you have the face of a scoundrel.\" Her eyes drifted slowly over his face and landed for a moment on his full lips. \"With lips created for sin.\"\"Keirah,\" he whispered, gently squeezing her hands. \"Talk like that is not helping matters.": "Madison",
  "Isn't he beautiful? His silky hair, his muscles so strong and powerful yet amazingly, he trembles slightly at my touch, and the more I stroke him, the more he leans into my hand,\" Keirah said her eyes remaining on the horse. Yes, Keirah, the horse is a fine one,\" Wharick said as he slowly walked closer to her. \"What I said was not to you, Gwarda,\" she teased, \"I was speaking to the horse.": "Madison",
  "You know you really have to beware of gypsies in these parts,\" he said teasingly, dismounting from his horse...Keirah gave him a small smile that she didn't quite feel. \"Good thing I have the Gwarda here to protect me,\" she teased back.": "Madison",
  "He was the most wickedly handsome creature she had ever seen in all her days. His hair was black as night, his stature large, his muscles were etched with precision into his smooth skin, every last ripple chiseled into wicked perfection.": "Madison",
  "One day, when you are sitting with my sister, Mahgen, around a fire, and you're feeling how perfectly right it is to be next to her, this moment, this tease of desire between us, will be long forgotten.": "Madison",
  "A warmth spread throughtout Keirah's body, in part from the closeness of Kathel, but mostly because she knew that he had meant Wharick. Kathel hadn't even spoken Wharick's name, but at the very inclination of her mate, Keirah's body had responded.": "Madison",
  "There are so many reasons why I should not kiss you right now. Believe me when I tell you that only moments ago those reasons played out in my mind, but for the life of me, at this very minute, I cannot recall even one of them,\" Kathel said.": "Madison",
  "If he sees you unclothed, I will have to kill him,\" he spoke in her ear. She didn't know if she should believe him or not, but she took no chances. \"Tell him to leave, then,\" she said calmly but sternly.": "Madison",
  "A slow, knowing smile came over Keirah's face. Her heart filled with happiness, believing the Gwarda gypsy sitting next to her at this very moment was worthy of her beloved sister.": "Madison",
  "Kathel did not back down at all. \"Well, Keirah told me she was suddenly unattached, if you know what I mean. And I figured, what the hell, why not have a go at her myself,\" Kathel said enthusiastically.": "Madison",
  "Even among the ugliness of evil that resonated throughout the green hills and flowering landscape, Northbrook was simply breathtaking to those who took the time to appreciate it.": "Madison",
  "I'm pleased to know you realize she is mine, gypsy. Care to explain why it is that I find you here in the Gwarda arena and touching what belongs to me?": "Madison",
  "You're causing the world to spin again, Keirah,\" Wharick teased about her druid gift with nature. \"You out of control? Do you need something to settle you down? he asked.": "Madison",
  "The fact that he got to save the Gwardian's mate and managed to piss him off at the same time, well that was just a bonus and pure luck of circumstance. After all, he had gypsy blood inside of him and could not stop the satisfaction he got from pissing people off.": "Madison",
  "You don't have a mommy,\" Gunnar proclaimed as he walked around Breccan. \"Ok, I want my surrogate,\" Breccan said as he sped up to catch the other men. Darius came forward to walk in step beside Wharick and whispered in a discreet tone, \"Please, let me kill him.": "Madison",
  "Kathel smoothed out his shirt in an exaggerated manner. \"It was the least I could do. I owed her one,\" he said referring to when Keirah saved Willow. He looked at Keirah and winked. Yeah, so not the thing to do right now, Keirah thought.": "Madison",
  "You may run from the calling, but, you will find no real peace until you fulfill your destiny.": "Madison",
  "Truth was she liked that he came after her. She liked the thought of being under submission to him in an intimate way. It was a welcome desire which Wharick alone sparked.": "Madison",
  "I do not belong to anyone! Certainly not to a self-centered, brute of man, err...being or whatever it is you are, person!\" she fumbled.": "Madison",
  "Darius did not take the bait, showing no signs of anger or irritation. \"So, what you're saying is that you ugly f@*ks are not half breeds and that makes you superior? Please, do wow me with your druid sorcery.": "Madison",
  "Oh, don't look at this frail, old druid like that, Solomon. I may be slow in my movements, buy my mind is sharp as a dagger's tip.\" Lazerin smirked.": "Madison",
  "You will answer this day for your treason.\" Then he added solemnly, \"You break my heart, brother.\" Before Eyramus could blink Thristan was gone.": "Madison",
  "Had Keirah and her sisters known what was set in motion the day their stones appeared and how personally they would be affected by it, they would have still fought the darkness, still battled for what belonged to them.": "Madison",
  "The new race of warriors would be their hope, their salvation, their loves' destiny. But they too could be tainted. They too could be seduced by the black forces they had been created to fight against.": "Madison",
  "Love knew no bounds, knew no limitations. It looked beyond the unseen realm and reached in for a taste, for a moment of regenerated happiness, and in that moment fate was altered and the destinies of many were changed. Their land, their Northbrook, they discovered, was a very magical place.": "Madison",

It looked beyond the unseen realm and reached in for a taste, for a moment of regenerated happiness, and in that moment fate was altered and the destinies of many were changed. Their land, their Northbrook, they discovered, was a very magical place.": "Madison",
  "She knew from her visions that she would be one of them, one of the chosen, set apart and marked for her mate. Unlike her, the other chosen women lived on earth, regenerated from the soul of a lost love, the most cherished of the heart, a Destoul.": "Madison",
  "That\u2019s what brave is, you know. Doing what needs to be done when you\u2019re scared shitless.": "Jacqueline",
  "I don\u2019t know if I can shoot a man.\u201dThe old woman cackled. \u201cCan\u2019t shoot \u2018em, but you can wallop \u2018em to death with a poker.\u201dElizabeth blanched. \u201cThat was before I knew they were men.\u201d\u201cMan, beast, don\u2019t matter. Something aims to kill you, your kin, your friends, you kill it first. You weren\u2019t carrying that poker to protect yourself against no wolf.": "Jacqueline",
  "His shoulder-length hair was a rich, dark-brown color with a slight wave to it and it flowed behind him as he ran into the center of the gypsies. He was tall, muscular, and so beautifully handsome, yet primal. He looked magnificent.": "Madison",
  "Darius began to walk away, but as if he thought better of it, turned back to face Wharick. He stared into the Gwardian's eyes for a moment and then spoke quietly. \"If ever a blade comes that close to my neck brother, the only debt you owe me is to make sure it connects.": "Madison",
  "There were three, very large males standing above her, staring. She started from left to right. Big green-eyed male, big green-eyed male and, hey, lookie there, another big green-eyed male. Dear gods. Did I fall so hard that now I am seeing three of them?": "Madison",
  "Thank you, I think. And what is your name?\" Keirah called out a bit more loudly, as she watched Darius retreat...\"His name is of no consequence.\" A male's loud, booming voice came from behind the two men who remained. The sound of his voice was gritty, husky, and the sound brought a spark to Keirah's blood.": "Madison",
  "You and your sister will be going with us this day, and that is not up for discussion.\" He moved closer. \"Nor will it be an argument.\" He stepped even closer and leaned his head slightly downward, his lips near her face. \"If you have a problem with that, little girl,\" he commented at her display of stubbornness, \"then I will be more than happy to have Darius put you over his shoulder and carry you out of here. Either way, you will do as you are told, and behave yourself.": "Madison",
  "Bitterness filled his heart, and he learned to love the feel of its magic.(Darius)": "Madison",
  "It's not the having of the gift that makes the difference in life here or in another place. It's how we use that gift that shows the true heart. ~ Acronis": "Madison",
  "She looked up into Wharick's ethereal face, her eyes drifting across his features. Close your mouth, Keirah. Her brain finally caught up with her face's reaction.": "Madison",
  "Dammnnn,\" Breccan slowly spoke each letter with a grin on his face that spread from ear to ear. \"Impressive flames, guy.": "Madison",
  "The bantering between them only caused their connection to spark that much more. Instead of forcing them to be at odds with each other, arguing did the opposite. It caused the flame to rise on the existing fire which churned inside of them, and they knew it and relished in the burn it created. There was a storm coming. As their desire intensified so did the turbulence of passion grow increasingly wild, demanding nothing less than consumption.": "Madison",
  "Thristan looked at her with a bewildered look on his face. \"You think to bind me as the new race will be bound?\" he asked solemnly. Sorvus smiled. \"I do not think to bind you, my friend; I think to free you.": "Madison",
  "Sorvus's eyes widened then fell as she accepted whatever fate had in store for her. \"It will be as it will, Thristan.\" Thristan looked at her intently, bringing his head back with a frustrated sigh. \"Ah, this 'destiny' crap you all talk about!": "Madison",
  "We are immortal beings, Thristan. You cannot hate me throughout all eternity.": "Madison",
  "Wharick, on the other hand, remained there with his eyebrows raised slightly as he waited for her to complain about his behavior. \"You have no right, Wharick,\" she said sternly. And there it is, he thought feeling more than pleased that he knew her better than she thought.": "Madison",
  "We don't recognize those times in our existence, when fate rolls around to sever relationships, to remove an object of such immense magnitude from our lives. No, on a whim it robs us of our last goodbyes and forces us to try and recall the most irrelevant of things like what they were clothed it the last time we saw them, what the expression was on their face. ~Acronis": "Madison",
  "Your fiery spirit excites me, Keirah, like nothing I have ever felt before. Yet I have the overwhelming desire to put you over my knee when you don't do as you are told.": "Madison",
  "He was determined to stick with his plan, convincing himself to stay neutral and detached. That's the plan!Then she leaned over him.": "Madison",
  "There was no mistaking what the feeling of fullness in his heart meant. They were mates and were bound together. Forever. Wharick's green eyes closed for a moment as he absorbed the feeling of completeness their bond provided his spirit.": "Madison",
  "You know, Breccan, we were all born into this realm for a purpose. We were born to live in that forest,\" Gunnar said, pointing ahead. He swallowed deeply as he continued to take in the sight of Surchin. Breccan came up behind Gunnar. \"And you know, we are all gonna die there. How convenient. Yep, we are all gonna find finality before we've taken a woman. So not the way I wanted things to go.": "Madison",
  "Why aren't I seeing more tracks?\" After no reply he repeated himself. \"Helllloooo, why aren't there more tracks?\" His eyes examined the ground. Then he suddenly saw a foot?

  "Oh, now look what you've done. You've gone and pissed him off,\" Breccan said as he stood behind two of the gypsies, one of his large hands clamped down on each of their shoulders.": "Madison",
  "Breccan stood for a second, deep in thought of what Darius had just described. \"Dude, seriously, you gotta get a hobby. Oh, and anyone else want their mothers right now? Cause, damn, that was some scary shit,\" he added.": "Madison",
  "It was the simplest of acts, the smallest of gestures, yet no one had taken the time to do something kind for her in a very long time. No one had made her feel special. Unbeknownst to her, a single, unfamiliar tear fell down her cheek as her worn and wounded body fell into a deep, safe slumber.": "Madison",
  "So, Gwardian, are you going to stand there, or may I have some privacy so I can bathe? We aren't all as full of ourselves as you are.": "Madison",
  "I hadn't realized she could shrink... It makes sense now with the tricks Ari was able to perform with her.\"\"She wasn't born that way. Her mother was a scientist working to reduce subatomic particles.\"\"And whose mom isn't?\" Raven joked. \"Was Rick Moranis involved somehow?": "J.T.",

Did he just say what I think he did?He looked back up at me, taking my breath. \"What are we gonna do?\"I knew what I was gonna do\u2014hyperventilate.": "Janae",
  "Myths tend to spiral out of control. Do you howl at the full moon and steal maidens to devour?\"\"Depends on the maiden,\" he said.Was he flirting with me? Devouring didn't really go with flirting, but his tone of voice did. Was this how werewolves flirted? Hey, baby, if I had to kill any girl and eat her flesh, it would be you...clean sweep": "Ilona",
  "What do you do when you\u2019re in a room of vampires and the most dangerous one tells you that youknow too much? You bolt. What did I do? I hyperventilated.": "Tijan,",

  "She\u2019d die before she let that demon touch her again. But maybe that was his plan all along.": "Lisa",
  "I wanted to hug him, tell him it was gonna be alright. Tell him I'm not as fragile as I look. But I can't hug him. I can't even hold his hand. I can't tell him it's gonna be alright, because it\u2019s not; not as long as he's dead and I'm alive.": "Janae",
  "There, amongst the angry water was the glow of green eyes, hundreds of them encompassed the entire area...We were completely and totally surrounded. They all hung just below the water waiting for a sign to attack. There was no hope. We would all perish...": "Meredith",

  "After Nick rescued Kate from an attack at the football game they talk as he drives her home. \"I said that because I really did see a monster.\" I looked at Nick as we turned a corner in the road. \"You don't think I'm crazy do you?\"I like that quote because it symbolizes the transition in Kate's life.

  "He hadn\u2019t been able to help himself, couldn\u2019t have stopped himself from kissing her even if he\u2019d tried. Fighting with her was a million times better than dreaming, and the fight had conjured his soul to act, to kiss her. And that kiss was nothing like anything he had ever experienced before.He knew if he would die then, he\u2019d die a happy man because it meant he\u2019d savor her forever, relish her passion among his.

  "Shit. Shit. Shit. He\u2019d known he couldn\u2019t save her. He\u2019d known he was too far away. Knowing didn\u2019t prevent the bare-knuckled punch to his heart, though.": "Dani",
  "When we get there, don\u2019t go in huffing and puffing like the big bad wolf.": "J.L.",
