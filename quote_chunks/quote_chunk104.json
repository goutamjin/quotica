  "For a man to strike any women is most brutal, and I, as well as everyone else, think this far worse than any attempt to shoot, which, wicked as it is, is at least more comprehensible and more courageous.": "Queen",
  "Fashion is always of the time in which you live. It is not something standing alone. But the grand problem, the most important problem, is to rejeuvenate women. To make women look young. Then their outlook changes. They feel more joyous.": "Coco",
  "Part of it went on gambling, and part of it went on women. The rest I spent foolishly.": "George",
  "Most women don't like good men. They say they want a good buy, but most women always wind up with the bad boy.": "Stephanie",
  "I wish I could just go tell all the young women I work with, all these fabulous women, 'Believe in yourself and negotiate for yourself. Own your own success.' I wish I could tell that to my daughter. But it's not that simple.": "Sheryl",
  "I want people to be afraid of the women I dress.": "Alexander",
  "I'm not convinced that women have the education or the sense of their own history enough or that they understand the cruelty of which men are capable and the delight that many men will take in seeing you choose to chain yourself - then they get to say 'See, you did it yourself.'": "Alice",
  "Women. They are a complete mystery.": "Stephen",
  "Well, the terrible thing right now, and I don't know the statistics, but there's a growing concern in some communities about how rapidly people are sent from school to jail, how quickly they're put into the criminal justice system. And of course the rapidly growing number of brown people, both men and women, in prison. And this is terrible.": "Anna",
  "I always thought of my mother as a warrior woman, and I became interested in pursuing stories of women who invent lives in order to survive.": "Lynn",
  "I'm very comfortable in my own skin now. I started just being myself more and more. For women, this happens as you get older. I loved my 40s - I thought they were fantastic. And I'm loving my 50s. I'm going to love everything because you're either older or dead!": "Gloria",
  "The problem for all women is we're identified by how we look instead of by our heads and our hearts.": "Gloria",
  "I think if women are visible in the media, truly visible, in an empowered role, it empowers us to be more visible in any area of our lives.": "Gloria",
  "Insomnia is a very prevalent issue. It's a women's health issue, and I chose to talk about it because so many people have experienced it to varying degrees. For me, I'm doing great now, but it took a lot of work to figure out how to get back to sleep. I had to change some of my habits. I developed some pretty bad sleep ritual habits.": "Jenny",

  "Bachelors know more about women than married men if they didn't they'd be married too.": "H.",
  "A man who pretends to understand women is bad manners. For him to really to understand them is bad morals.": "Henry",

  "No nation, savage or civilized, save only the United States of America, has confessed its inability to protect its women save by hanging, shooting, and burning alleged offenders.": "Ida",
  "It is women who love horror. Gloat over it. Feed on it. Are nourished by it. Shudder and cling and cry out-and come back for more.": "Bela",
  "A large part of the present anxiety to improve the education of girls and women is also due to the conviction that the political disabilities of women will not be maintained.": "Millicent",
  "It is only in the fundamentalist religions that women are relegated to second class. Radical Evangelicals, Muslims, and Jews all have the same view of women.": "Sally",
  "Guys are simple... women are not simple and they always assume that men must be just as complicated as they are, only way more mysterious. The whole point is guys are not thinking much. They are just what they appear to be. Tragically.": "Dave",

  "Women, by their nature, are not exceptional chess players: they are not great fighters.": "Garry",
  "Lesbian existence comprises both the breaking of a taboo and the rejection of a compulsory way of life. It is also a direct or indirect attack on the male right of access to women.": "Adrienne",
  "If any come to my house to be instructed in the ways of God what rule have I to put them away? Do you think it not lawful for me to teach women and why do you call me to teach the court?": "Anne",

  "I decided blacks should not have to experience the difficulties I had faced, so I decided to open a flying school and teach other black women to fly.": "Bessie",
  "Although we have, in theory, abolished human slavery, recognized women's rights, and stopped child labor, we continue to enslave other species who, if we simply pay attention, show quite clearly that they experience parental love, pain, and the desire for freedom, just as we do.": "Ingrid",
  "The battle for the individual rights of women is one of long standing and none of us should countenance anything which undermines it.": "Eleanor",

  "Rules like 'don't wear white after Labor Day' or 'shoes matching the handbag' are antiquated. Modern women should feel free to experiment.": "Stacy",
  "When I was growing up, you didn't know there was a women's national team. Now girls grow up dreaming of playing for Canada.": "Christine",

  "The especial genius of women I believe to be electrical in movement, intuitive in function, spiritual in tendency.": "Margaret",

  "Women think with their whole bodies and they see things as a whole more than men do.": "Dorothy",
  "Women must pay for everything. They do get more glory than men for comparable feats, but, they also get more notoriety when they crash.": "Amelia",
  "Feminism has never been about getting a job for one woman. It's about making life more fair for women everywhere. It's not about a piece of the existing pie there are too many of us for that. It's about baking a new pie.": "Gloria",
  "I realize now that I've hoped to be great - as an actress, as a mother - because I want to embody the greatness of women who didn't get to be all they could have been. Their dignity, their courage, and their brilliance make me strive to be better. They're a part of me.": "Salma",
  "Reproductive choice has to be straightened out. There will never be a woman of means without choice anymore. That just seems to me so obvious. The states that changed their abortion laws before Roe are not going to change back. So we have a policy that only affects poor women, and it can never be otherwise.": "Ruth",
  "Women always want to be what they're not: If you're the pretty girl, you want to be the quirky girl. If you're the smart girl, you want to be the pretty girl.": "Jordana",
  "On Memorial Day, I don't want to only remember the combatants. There were also those who came out of the trenches as writers and poets, who started preaching peace, men and women who have made this world a kinder place to live.": "Eric",

  "Smart women love smart men more than smart men love smart women.": "Natalie",
  "Are some women and children going to die? Yeah. But it's doing the right thing. You got money, you sit around talking about peace. People who don't have money need some help.": "Kid",

  "Mr. President how long must women wait to get their liberty? Let us have the rights we deserve.": "Alice",
  "Today, most women are surrounded by ingenious gadgets. They don't grow the peas or raise the chicken that they serve for dinner; instead they hunt and gather in the grocery store. They go through catalogs or department stores to buy clothes instead of shearing sheep, carding wool, and weaving cloth for skirts and coats and blankets.": "Helen",
  "It is capitalist America that produced the modern independent woman. Never in history have women had more freedom of choice in regard to dress, behavior, career, and sexual orientation.": "Camille",

  "My mother told me two things constantly. One was to be a lady and the other was to be independent, and the law was something most unusual for those times because for most girls growing up in the '40s, the most important degree was not your B.A. but your M.R.S.": "Ruth",
  "Women don't take enough risks. Men are just 'foot on the gas pedal.' We're not going to close the achievement gap until we close the ambition gap.": "Sheryl",
  "Above all, we must realize that no arsenal, or no weapon in the arsenals of the world, is so formidable as the will and moral courage of free men and women. It is a weapon our adversaries in today's world do not have.": "Ronald",

  "My advice to women in general: Even if you're doing a nine-to-five job, treat yourself like a boss. Not arrogant, but be sure of what you want - and don't allow people to run anything for you without your knowledge.": "Nicki",
  "Aviation offered such fun as crossing the continent in planes large and small, trying the whirling rotors of an autogiro, making record flights. With these activities came opportunity to know women everywhere who shared my conviction that there is so much women can do in the modern world and should be permitted to do irrespective of their sex.": "Amelia",
  "Women are most fascinating between the ages of 35 and 40 after they have won a few races and know how to pace themselves. Since few women ever pass 40, maximum fascination can continue indefinitely.": "Christian",
  "People are more violently opposed to fur than leather because it's safer to harass rich women than motorcycle gangs.": "Alexei",
  "We as women, we have to understand that we know more, just even instinctively, than we think we do.": "Michelle",

  "The search for human freedom can never be complete without freedom for women.": "Betty",
  "Women love a self-confident bald man.": "Larry",
  "I love to wear lingerie. The problem is that men always rip it off too quickly. When women are dolled up in lingerie they feel sexy. So let us wear it for five minutes.": "Karen",

  "The religious superstitions of women perpetuate their bondage more than all other adverse influences.": "Elizabeth",
  "We Abolition Women are turning the world upside down.": "Angelina",
  "It is generally recognised that women are better than men at languages, personal relations and multi-tasking, but less good at map-reading and spatial awareness. It is therefore not unreasonable to suppose that women might be less good at mathematics and physics.": "Stephen",
  "I believe that Brazil was prepared to elect a woman. Why? Because Brazilian women achieved that. I didn't come here by myself, by my own merits. We are a majority here in this country.": "Dilma",
  "There is no such thing as low maintenance or high maintenance, just a bunch of women hoping for a capable mechanic.": "Liz",
  "The worst enemy women have is in the pulpit.": "Susan",
  "Over the years, I've interviewed thousands of people, most of them women, and I would say that the root of every dysfunction I've ever encountered, every problem, has been some sense of a lacking of self-value or of self-worth.": "Oprah",
  "All Americans should take great pride in the men and women serving our nation in Iraq and in the courage, determination, resilience and initiative they demonstrate each and every day. It remains the greatest of honors to soldier with them.": "David",
  "The men and women in the Armed Forces, that's what I always think about and what I teach my kids about. We're getting ready to sit down at the table and have Thanksgiving, and there's people that are not with their families.": "Guy",
  "Because I am a woman, I must make unusual efforts to succeed. If I fail, no one will say, 'She doesn't have what it takes'; They will say, 'Women don't have what it takes.'": "Clare",

  "Can you not see that women could do and would do a hundred times more for the slave, if she were not fettered?": "Angelina",
  "With women, I've got a long bamboo pole with a leather loop on the end. I slip the loop around their necks so they can't get away or come too close. Like catching snakes.": "Marlon",
  "No one wants to see curvy women.": "Karl",
  "Motherhood has brought me many joys and insights, but the new perspective it granted me on the role I had inadvertently played in young women's lives for the 2 decades I spent in the modeling industry was downright sobering.": "Carre",
  "People always say that Californian women are obsessed with their appearance but I think you've got to take good care of yourself, for yourself.": "Linda",
  "Every principle of liberty enunciated in any civilized country on earth, with very few exceptions, was intended entirely for men, and when women tried to force the putting into practice of these principles, for women, then they discovered they had come into a very, very unpleasant situation indeed.": "Emmeline",
  "When one begins, as I did, to analyze men after a fairly long experience of analyzing women, one receives a most surprising impression of the intensity of this envy of pregnancy, childbirth, and motherhood, as well as of breasts and of the act of suckling.": "Karen",
  "People say Malala's voice is being sold to the world. But I see it as Malala's voice reaching the world and resonating globally. You should think about what is behind Malala's voice. What is she saying? I am only talking about education, women's rights, and peace.": "Malala",
  "I care very much about women and their progress. I didn't go march in the streets, but when I was in the Arizona Legislature, one of the things that I did was to examine every single statute in the state of Arizona to pick out the ones that discriminated against women and get them changed.": "Sandra",
  "Investing in women's lives is an investment in sustainable development, in human rights, in future generations - and consequently in our own long-term national interests.": "Liya",
  "Women with low self-esteem love bad boys. Women who have work to do love bad boys. Women who love themselves love good men.": "Tracy",

  "To me, my brand is luxury, it's art, it's women, it's raw, it's urban.": "Theophilus",
  "Since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963, the gap between men and women's earnings has narrowed by less than a half-cent per year. At this rate, American women will have to wait until 2062 to bring home the same salary as their male counterparts.": "Jackie",
  "Men and women who decide to flirt with adultery just once can become enmeshed in misery and unhappiness for themselves and their precious families.": "Joseph",
  "Others have said it before me. If you don't have a seat at the table, you're probably on the menu. And so it is important that we have women in the United States Senate - strong women, women who are there to help advance an agenda that is important to women.": "Elizabeth",
  "Financial inclusion matters not only because it promotes growth, but because it helps ensure prosperity is widely shared. Access to financial services plays a critical role in lifting people out of poverty, in empowering women, and in helping governments deliver services to their people.": "Sri",

  "Every argument for Negro suffrage is an argument for women's suffrage.": "W.",
  "Sometimes when we think about femininity, we think also fragile. But I think you can be feminine and very strong. I think make-up goes with that femininity. I think it's a natural gesture for women and one they do more for themselves than for others.": "Monica",
  "Women feel empowered when they can do the things that are supposed to be only for men, you know? It breaks boundaries, it's liberating, and it's empowering when you feel like, 'Well, I can do that, too.'": "Rihanna",

  "There are two kinds of women, those who want power in the world and those who want power in bed.": "Jackie",
  "I have lived and slept in the same bed with English countesses and Prussian farm women... no woman has excited passions among women more than I have.": "Florence",

  "The truth is, I often like women. I like their unconventionality. I like their completeness. I like their anonymity.": "Virginia",

  "A women under stress is not immediately concerned with finding solutions to her problems but rather seeks relief by expressing herself and being understood.": "John",

  "Any one must see at a glance that if men and women marry those whom they do not love, they must love those whom they do not marry.": "Harriet",
  "The sum and substance of female education in America, as in England, is training women to consider marriage as the sole object in life, and to pretend that they do not think so.": "Harriet",
  "Money and women. They're two of the strongest things in the world. The things you do for a woman you wouldn't do for anything else. Same with money.": "Satchel",
  "As the French say, there are three sexes - men, women, and clergymen.": "Sydney",
  "One of the sad commentaries on the way women are viewed in our society is that we have to fit one category. I have never felt that I had to be in one category.": "Faye",

  "Henceforth the leaves of the tree of knowledge were for women, and for the healing of the nations.": "Lucy",
  "I like working with actresses, and I like women a lot, not for obvious reasons, but just in that that there's so much about what they bring to the scene that keeps it so interesting. Their instincts are so different, and they never explain them to you.": "Ryan",
  "The workingmen have perceived that women are in the field of industry to stay; and they see, too, that there can not be two standards of work and wages for any trade without constant menace to the higher standard.": "Florence",
  "It's amazing to me that, in the 42 years since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act into law, women today still receive fewer wages than men for the same work.": "Mike",
  "Through persistent dedication, Susan B. Anthony, and other remarkable leaders, women were finally granted the right to vote in 1920.": "Louise",

  "I feel sorry sometimes for these sportsmen and women who put in just as much effort as the footballers. For example, athletes train at least as hard as footballers but have to be happy if they can earn enough to finance a decent education.": "Angela",
  "To generalize on women is dangerous. To specialize on them is infinitely worse.": "Rudolph",
  "Women's Wear Daily can do more than any other publication to establish a designer.": "Calvin",

  "Single women have a dreadful propensity for being poor. Which is one very strong argument in favor of matrimony.": "Jane",

  "Kindness is the essence of greatness and the fundamental characteristic of the noblest men and women I have known.": "Joseph",
  "I always encourage women to let their individuality show by not covering up what they perceive as flaws. When I see a woman with the natural wrinkles of time on her face, I do not see the wrinkles at all, but when I see a woman trying to cover them up with too much foundation or concealer, all I see are her wrinkles.": "Isabella",
  "All of the women on The Apprentice flirted with me - consciously or unconsciously. That's to be expected.": "Donald",
  "The issue is not abortion. The issue is whether women can make up their own mind instead of some right-wing pastor, some right-wing politician telling them what to do.": "Howard",
  "Yet consider now, whether women are not quite past sense and reason, when they want to rule over men.": "John",

  "A great city is that which has the greatest men and women.": "Walt",
  "Feminism is hated because women are hated. Anti-feminism is a direct expression of misogyny it is the political defense of women hating.": "Andrea",
  "A pessimist is a man who thinks all women are bad. An optimist is one who hopes they are.": "Chauncey",
  "The serious problems facing the world today will never be solved until women are able to use their full potential on behalf of themselves, their families, and their global and local communities, as the World Bank and others have discovered.": "Jenny",
  "If women can be railroad workers in Russia, why can't they fly in space?": "Valentina",
  "Every woman is sexy in her own way. It is up to men to step up and make women feel like they are No. 1 on that list. There is no such thing as perfection.": "Kendra",

  "Women, can't live with them, can't live without them.": "Desiderius",
  "Youth is impulsive. When our young men grow angry at some real or imaginary wrong, and disfigure their faces with black paint, it denotes that their hearts are black, and that they are often cruel and relentless, and our old men and old women are unable to restrain them. Thus it has ever been.": "Chief",

  "I don't know why women want any of the things men have when one of the things that women have is men.": "Coco",

  "My father respected and admired my mother and was a person who was always standing by my side, encouraging me to do more and believed in my capacity. So in that sense, my own experience was very good in becoming an empowered woman. From early on, I carried that strong message: 'You can do it.' So I never had any doubt that women can do a lot.": "Michelle",
  "Men make the moral code and they expect women to accept it. They have decided that it is entirely right and proper for men to fight for their liberties and their rights, but that it is not right and proper for women to fight for theirs.": "Emmeline",

  "At present, our country needs women's idealism and determination, perhaps more in politics than anywhere else.": "Shirley",
  "I think the men in L.A. are very rugged, good-looking. Men in New York look metro with their manis and pedis and their Bruno Magli loafers, but inside they're very masculine - aside from the Meatpacking District. The problem is the men in New York are five to one: five women to one man.": "Patti",
  "There's always a side of me that goes, 'I'm just a nerd.' I never look at myself and say, 'I'm beautiful.' Like anyone else, I see the flaws. Guys don't do that as much as women. But you have to learn to appreciate and accept and love yourself as you are.": "Heather",
  "I've had old people in my life that I really loved - especially women - so I'm not scared about getting old. It's what's inside that makes us beautiful on the outside.": "Monica",
  "The man who loves other countries as much as his own stands on a level with the man who loves other women as much as he loves his own wife.": "Theodore",
  "If we have a situation where a man is particularly graceful in a sport that rewards grace - say, for example, figure skating - why is it that we don't say to the man, 'Well, you're too feminine to compete?'... I don't understand why we don't find it offensive also to say to a women who's very strong, 'You're too masculine to compete.'": "Alice",
  "I like to think that I represent myself as a strong woman, so to work with other strong women I find very inspiring.": "Annabelle",
  "The use of slave women as day workers naturally broke up or made impossible the normal Negro home, and this and the slave code led to a development of which the South was really ashamed and which it often denied, and yet perfectly evident: the raising of slaves in the Border slave states for systematic sale on the commercialized cotton plantations.": "W.",
  "Indeed, the Muslims have all the social evils of the Hindus and something more. That something more is the compulsory system of purdah for Muslim women. These burka women walking in the streets is one of the most hideous sights one can witness in India.": "B.",

  "A world-class playboy once told me that the key to mesmerising women is to listen to them and look deeply into their eyes.": "George",
  "As a result of 50 years of emancipation, feminine qualities were dying out or being transferred to the males. Pansies of both sexes were everywhere, not yet completely homosexual, but confused not knowing what they were. The result was a herd of unhappy sexual misfits... the women wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied.": "Ian",
  "I have always felt strongly about empowering women. I'm living proof that, with confidence and by believing in yourself, you can accomplish any goal.": "Queen",
  "I think scent is sensual. I guess evoking a mood or a spirit is key, and I think with the women's fragrances we have evoked different types, moods or sensibilities of a woman - whether it's Daisy with the sweetness and the innocence or Lola which is more provocative, sexy and sultry.": "Marc",
  "When I look around at this world, we women need each other so badly, it breaks my heart. Sisterhood is dissipating, and we aren't doing nearly enough to salvage it. Eliminate the crazies in your life, yes. But also look again at those around you.": "Grace",
  "I'll take the stairs instead of the elevator, or when I'm on a phone call, I'll do squats or pace the room when I'm talking. We're modern women! We have to figure out how to make it work, right?": "Ivanka",

  "Men's memoirs are about answers; women's memoirs are about questions. Most male authors want to look good in their memoirs and have a place in posterity, while most women know that posterity is what happens when you no longer care.

  "But what of black women?... I most sincerely doubt if any other race of women could have brought its fineness up through so devilish a fire.": "W.",

  "It's rather splendid to think of all those great men and women who appear to have presented symptoms that allow us to describe them as bipolar. Whether it's Hemingway, Van Gogh... Robert Schumann has been mentioned... Virginia Woolf, Sylvia Plath... some of them with rather grim ends.": "Stephen",
  "I'm supportive of women, absolutely, and it's so gratifying to have girls come up and say, 'I'm really inspired by your guitar playing.' I mean no disrespect to the sisterhood, but musically I feel more drawn to things like Dirty Projectors, the National and Grizzly Bear.": "St.",
  "The idea that women are innately gentle is a fantasy, and a historically recent one.

  "Not all single women want to be married. Not all boys like football. Not all homemakers like to cook. Not all messy people are lazy. And not all the obese are gluttons.

  "There's competition among women everywhere you go. But back home, we understand that you can look like a variety of things and still be from the same culture. What I'm saying is that I've never felt like I was a light-skinned black woman. Never felt that way because we shared the same culture back home.": "Grace",
  "Women are tough, but sometimes women present toughness in different ways.": "Katherine",

  "Honor your daughters. They are honorable.": "Malala",
  "My mistake in my relationships has been to feel that I can do it all on my own: 'I don't need a man.' That is definitely a mistake. Women generally want to feel loved and appreciated. It's something that I am working on every day, trust me! It's a challenge for me to do that.": "Miranda",
  "Long before history began we men have got together apart from the women and done things. We had time.": "C.",

  "I see women in their 30s getting plastic surgery, pulling this up and tucking that back. It's like a slippery slope - once you start you pull one thing one way and then you think, 'Oh my God, I've got to do the other side.'": "Halle",
  "When I go through the airport and see white women walking through the airport barefooted, like athlete's feet don't exist, there's something wrong.": "Dick",

  "Well, guys are better at mechanical stuff and women are better at emotional stuff.": "Adam",
  "How do you give smart, accomplished, ambitious women the same opportunities as men to reach their goals? What about universal preschool and after-school programs? What about changing the corporate mind-set about the time commitment it takes to move up the ladder? What about having more husbands step up and take the major load?": "Gail",

  "A series of studies in the 1990s and 2000s revealed that as women gained more access to education, jobs, and birth control, they had fewer children. As a result, developed countries in western Europe, Japan, and the Americas were seeing zero or negative population growth.": "Annalee",

  "I vividly remember watching women in films when I was nine or 10, picturing them being what I'd be like as an adult. I had these real female crushes on certain actresses. And I'd watch them, thinking, 'One day, I'll be that. One day I'll be a woman.'": "Alicia",
  "Society tends to pin women against each other, but we need to treat each other with kindness and compliment one another instead. Because women's voices are the strongest when they're together.": "Normani",

  "Women now have choices. They can be married, not married, have a job, not have a job, be married with children, unmarried with children. Men have the same choice we've always had: work, or prison.": "Tim",
  "I like women who look like women. I hated grunge. No one's more feminist than me, but you don't have to look as if you don't give a - you know. You can be smart, bright, and attractive aesthetically to others - and to yourself.": "Catherine",

  "Now is the most exciting time in fashion. Women are controlling their destiny now, the consumer is more knowledgeable, and I have to be better every single day.": "Oscar",
  "Women of the working class, especially wage workers, should not have more than two children at most. The average working man can support no more and and the average working woman can take care of no more in decent fashion.": "Margaret",

  "Years ago women of my size were considered royalty.": "Camryn",
  "I will say that the idea of a woman being deceptive came from that original discussion with critics and reporters about if woman could do that kind of thing. Evelyn, herself, grew out of the discussions about how capable women are of deceit and lying and manipulation.": "Neil",
  "Women priests. Great, great. Now there's priests of both sexes I don't listen to.": "Bill",

  "The women's movement completely changed attitudes all over the world in ways we'll never be able to count.": "Holly",
  "In God, the characteristics of men and women that we admire in men and women are combined. That's been a traditional Catholic teaching that God is the combination of opposites.": "Andrew",

  "Ultimately, leadership is not about glorious crowning acts.

  "Technology can be our best friend, and technology can also be the biggest party pooper of our lives.

  "The biggest thing for me is the passion that I've always had for hockey. I remember growing up, no matter what I did in life, my parents always told me to try to do my best at it and be my best.

  "Entrepreneurship is like a computer game in which you have to master every level before achieving success. Startups repeatedly stumble and have to go back to the drawing board. The best way to skip some levels and to increase the odds of survival is to learn from others who have already played the game.": "Vivek",
  "At United, there are great traditions, which you can't buy in one or two years. They are created by victories. You need to prove again and again that you are better than the others. Manchester United have always done this, and are still doing it, so they are the best.": "Cristiano",
  "The best art is realized when you can share the experience of making of it and not just the presentation of it, so that the audience is part of the creation and not just part of the consumption. Then it becomes much more full-bodied and robust.": "Ava",

  "Nobody's life is a bed of roses. We all have crosses to bear, and we all just do our best. I would never claim to have the worst situation.

  "A high-powered, successful woman doesn't necessarily have the same support behind her that a man in that position would.

  "Sometimes the best way to learn something is by doing it wrong and looking at what you did.": "Neil",
  "We can use decision-making to choose the habits we want to form, use willpower to get the habit started, then - and this is the best part - we can allow the extraordinary power of habit to take over. At that point, we're free from the need to decide and the need to use willpower.": "Gretchen",
  "One of the best predictors of policy around is Thomas Ferguson's investment theory of politics, as he calls it - very outstanding political economist - which essentially - I mean, to say it in a sentence, he describes elections as occasions in which groups of investors coalesce and invest to control the state.": "Noam",

  "In football, it's the job of the player to play, the coach to coach, the official to officiate. Each guy is charged with upholding his end, nothing more.

  "Fit no stereotypes. Don't chase the latest management fads. The situation dictates which approach best accomplishes the team's mission.": "Colin",
  "I think one of the reasons that we like conspiracy theories is I think that we like to feel like there is a group of people who are so smart and powerful that they can pull the wool over an entire country or in fact even an entire world's eyes. That certainly makes us feel like somehow we're protected, even if it's not in our best interest.": "Jason",

  "No man is good enough to govern another man without the other's consent.": "Abraham",

  "We are all human beings, and we all have insecurities, but it's about being healthy and happy with yourself. I'm not perfect, and I will indulge in pizza and sweets on occasion.

  "The worst thing about Halloween is, of course, candy corn. It's unbelievable to me. Candy corn is the only candy in the history of America that's never been advertised. And there's a reason.

  "I was always told that I was good in mathematics, and I guess my grades and standardized test scores supported that.

  "History shows that all protest movements rely on symbols - boycotts, strikes, sit-ins, flags, songs. Symbolic action on whatever scale - from the Montgomery Bus Boycott to wearing a simple wristband - is designed to disrupt our everyday complacency and force people to think.": "Hugh",
  "Automobiles have always been part of my life, and I'm sure they always will be. What is it about them that moves me? The sound of a great engine, the unity and uniqueness of an automobile's engineering and coachwork, the history of the company and the car, and, of course, the sheer beauty of the thing.": "Edward",

  "History, in general, only informs us of what bad government is.": "Thomas",
  "In many ways, history is marked as 'before' and 'after' Rosa Parks. She sat down in order that we all might stand up, and the walls of segregation came down.": "Jesse",
  "Sometimes it is said that man cannot be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then be trusted with the government of others? Or have we found angels in the form of kings to govern him? Let history answer this question.": "Thomas",

  "When history is erased, people's moral values are also erased.": "Ma",
  "When it comes to discrimination, Americans pride ourselves on how far we've come. Racial segregation is history. Explicit sex discrimination is banned. Same-sex marriage is the law of the land. But amidst all the progress, the male-female wage gap persists, and it's big.": "Cass",
  "One individual can begin a movement that turns the tide of history. Martin Luther King in the civil rights movement, Mohandas Ganhi in India, Nelson Mandela in South Africa are examples of people standing up with courage and non-violence to bring about needed changes.": "Jack",
  "What happens when good people are put into an evil place? Do they triumph or does the situation dominate their past history and morality?": "Philip",

  "Among the many misdeeds of the British rule in India, history will look upon the act depriving a whole nation of arms as the blackest.": "Mahatma",

  "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history.": "Mao",

  "The monuments of the nations are all protests against nothingness after death so are statues and inscriptions so is history.": "Lew",

  "Who has fully realized that history is not contained in thick books but lives in our very blood?": "Carl",

  "I am trying to make art that relates to the deepest and most mythic concerns of human kind and I believe that, at this moment of history, feminism is humanism.": "Judy",
  "There's probably more history now preserved underwater than in all the museums of the world combined. And there's no law governing that history. It's finders keepers.": "Robert",
  "After the Berlin Wall came down I visited that city and I will never forget it. The abandoned checkpoints. The sense of excitement about the future.

  "That men do not learn very much from the lessons of history is the most important of all the lessons of history.": "Aldous",
  "The megalomaniac differs from the narcissist by the fact that he wishes to be powerful rather than charming, and seeks to be feared rather than loved. To this type belong many lunatics and most of the great men of history.": "Bertrand",
  "That human behavior is more influenced by things outside of us than inside. The 'situation' is the external environment. The inner environment is genes, moral history, religious training.": "Philip",

  "During the long process of history, by relying on our own diligence, courage and wisdom, Chinese people have opened up a good and beautiful home where all ethnic groups live in harmony and fostered an excellent culture that never fades.": "Xi",
  "There was no United States before slavery. I am sure somebody can make some sort of argument about modern French identity and slavery and North Africa, but there simply is no American history before black people.": "Ta-Nehisi",

  "If one tries to think about history, it seems to me - it's like looking at a range of mountains. And the first time you see them, they look one way. But then time changes, the pattern of light shifts. Maybe you've moved slightly, your perspective has changed. The mountains are the same, but they look very different.": "Robert",
  "Whenever I think of my birthplace, Walton-on-Thames, my reference first and foremost is the river. I love the smell of the river; love its history, its gentleness. I was aware of its presence from my earliest years. Its majesty centered me, calmed me, was a solace to a certain extent.": "Julie",
  "The suicide bombers who struck London on 7 July 2005 killed 52 innocent people and wounded hundreds more. All of them must live with their memories. And the rest of us will always remember where we were when we heard that London had been hit by the worst terrorist attack in its history.": "Pauline",
  "I'm turned on by guys who are cultured. That'll keep me intrigued. They don't have to have a single degree, but they should speak other languages or know things about other parts of the world or history or certain artists or musicians. I like to be taught. I like to sit on that side of the table.": "Rihanna",
  "What you see is that the most outstanding feature of life's history is a constant domination by bacteria.": "Stephen",

  "Tell the FBI that the kidnappers should pick out a judge that Nixon wants back.": "William",
  "The revolutionary breakthrough will come with rockets that are fully and rapidly reusable. We will never conquer Mars unless we do that. It'll be too expensive. The American colonies would never have been pioneered if the ships that crossed the ocean hadn't been reusable.": "Elon",
  "History does not record in its annals any lasting domination exercised by one people over another, of different race, of diverse usages and customs, of opposite and divergent ideals. One of the two had to yield and succumb.": "Jose",
  "Museums are managers of consciousness. They give us an interpretation of history, of how to view the world and locate ourselves in it. They are, if you want to put it in positive terms, great educational institutions. If you want to put it in negative terms, they are propaganda machines.": "Hans",

  "Understanding the long, sordid history of gun control in America is key to understanding the dangers of disarming.": "Niger",
  "Crafts make us feel rooted, give us a sense of belonging and connect us with our history. Our ancestors used to create these crafts out of necessity, and now we do them for fun, to make money and to express ourselves.": "Phyllis",
  "Civil disobedience has an honourable history, and when the urgency and moral clarity cross a certain threshold, then I think that civil disobedience is quite understandable, and it has a role to play.": "Al",
  "Classes struggle, some classes triumph, others are eliminated. Such is history; such is the history of civilization for thousands of years.": "Mao",
  "Anyone who believes you can't change history has never tried to write his memoirs.": "David",
  "So when I read this story, it unlocked a volcano of unanswered questions, because the questions had never been asked. It was an opportunity to come to terms with the lot of repressed history - and history of repression.": "Phillip",
  "It is in Rousseau's writing above all that history begins to turn from upper-class honour to middle-class humanitarianism. Pity, sympathy and compassion lie at the centre of his moral vision. Values associated with the feminine begin to infiltrate social existence as a whole, rather than being confined to the domestic sphere.": "Terry",
  "My favourite finds are often antique pieces with a history.": "Alice",
  "The injustices endured by black Americans at the hands of their own government have no parallel in our history, not only during the period of slavery but also in the Jim Crow era that followed.": "Jim",
  "Even the most meticulous historians work subjectively. The historian's point of view, his or her selection of subject and sources, the emphasis, the tone - all of these lead to subjective history, inevitably so. I do not say this as a criticism, merely as an observation.": "David",
  "If you read enough biography and history, you learn how people have dealt successfully or unsuccessfully with similar situations or patterns in the past. It doesn't give you a template of answers, but it does help you refine the questions you have to ask yourself.": "James",
  "Read no history: nothing but biography, for that is life without theory.": "Benjamin",
  "Man is not logical and his intellectual history is a record of mental reserves and compromises. He hangs on to what he can in his old beliefs even when he is compelled to surrender their logical basis.": "John",
  "All the lessons of history in four sentences: Whom the gods would destroy, they first make mad with power. The mills of God grind slowly, but they grind exceedingly small. The bee fertilizes the flower it robs. When it is dark enough, you can see the stars.": "Charles",
  "For most of history, Anonymous was a woman.": "Virginia",
  "It is like writing history with lightning and my only regret is that it is all so terribly true.": "Woodrow",
  "There is no history of mankind, there are only many histories of all kinds of aspects of human life. And one of these is the history of political power. This is elevated into the history of the world.": "Karl",
  "Revolutions are the periods of history when individuals count most.": "Norman",
  "And remember, where you have a concentration of power in a few hands, all too frequently men with the mentality of gangsters get control. History has proven that.": "Lord",
  "This is our history - from the Transcontinental Railroad to the Hoover Dam, to the dredging of our ports and building of our most historic bridges - our American ancestors prioritized growth and investment in our nation's infrastructure.": "Cory",
  "Life moves fast. As much as you can learn from your history, you have to move forward.": "Eddie",
  "We don't see the global citizen as someone with no identity, but rather someone who has confidence and is proud of his culture and history - and... open to the modern world.": "Moza",
  "The worst pandemic in modern history was the Spanish flu of 1918, which killed tens of millions of people. Today, with how interconnected the world is, it would spread faster.": "Bill",
  "Our landscapes connect us to our history; they are the source of our character as a peopl, as well as our health, our safety, and our prosperity. Natural resources enrich us economically, yes. But they also enrich us aesthetically and recreationally and culturally and spiritually.": "Robert",
  "No cause is left but the most ancient of all, the one, in fact, that from the beginning of our history has determined the very existence of politics, the cause of freedom versus tyranny.": "Hannah",
  "All I know is that history repeats itself and people are going to want to experience the world. But I know then they are going to have a better appreciation for what is here in Maine.": "John",
  "The Communist regime didn't consider this to be a shining moment in history and assigned no heroism to it. They classified it as merely an accident.": "Kathryn",

  "Americans love to fight. All real Americans love the sting of battle.": "George",
  "The worst mistake of first contact, made throughout history by individuals on both sides of every new encounter, has been the unfortunate habit of making assumptions. It often proved fatal.": "David",

  "If we could read the secret history of our enemies we should find in each man's life sorrow and suffering enough to disarm all hostility.": "Henry",

  "Contrary to what we learn from progressives in education and the media, the history of the Democratic Party well into the twentieth century is a virtually uninterrupted history of thievery, corruption, and bigotry.": "Dinesh",

  "I think documentaries are the greatest way to educate an entire generation that doesn't often look back to learn anything about the history that provided a safe haven for so many of us today.": "Steven",
  "All cultures through all time have constantly been engaged in a dance with new possibilities for life. Change is the one constant in human history.": "Wade",
  "Worshipping the Lord means giving Him the place that he must have; worshipping the Lord means stating, believing - not only by our words - that He alone truly guides our lives; worshipping the Lord means that we are convinced before Him that He is the only God, the God of our lives, the God of our history.": "Pope",
  "The acceptance of the facts of African-American history and the African-American historian as a legitimate part of the academic community did not come easily. Slavery ended and left its false images of black people intact.": "John",

  "Of the twenty-two civilizations that have appeared in history, nineteen of them collapsed when they reached the moral state the United States is in now.": "Arnold",
  "Here you have an incredibly ambitious, accomplished woman who comes up against some of the same problems that women in power come up against today. Cleopatra plays an oddly pivotal role in world history as well; in her lifetime, Alexandria is the center of the universe, Rome is still a backwater.": "Stacy",

  "I was France.": "Charles",
  "I have tried to lift France out of the mud. But she will return to her errors and vomitings. I cannot prevent the French from being French.": "Charles",
  "The whole course of human history may depend on a change of heart in one solitary and even humble individual - for it is in the solitary mind and soul of the individual that the battle between good and evil is waged and ultimately won or lost.": "M.",

  "If we celebrate Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday at a time of presidential inaugurals, this is thanks to Ronald Reagan who created the holiday, and not to the Democratic Congress of the Carter years, which rejected it.": "David",
  "All of us have a place in history. Mine is clouds.": "Richard",
  "What has history said of eminence without honor, wealth without wisdom, power and possessions without principle? The answer is reiterated in the overthrow of the mightiest empires of ancient times. Babylon, Persia, Greece, Rome! The four successive, universal powers of the past. What and where are they?": "Orson",
  "Jewelry and pins have been worn throughout history as symbols of power, sending messages. Interestingly enough, it was mostly men who wore the jewelry in various times, and obviously crowns were part of signals that were being sent throughout history by people of rank.": "Madeleine",

  "Uncertainty and fear and ignorance about immigrants, about people who are different, has a history as old as our Nation.": "Luis",
  "History does nothing; it does not possess immense riches, it does not fight battles. It is men, real, living, who do all this.": "Karl",
  "What you end up seeing when you look at history is that people who have been good at pushing the boundaries of possibility, and exploring those frontiers of good ideas and innovations, have rarely done it in moments of great inspiration. They don't just have a brilliant breakthrough idea out of nowhere and leap ahead of everyone else.": "Steven",
  "Considering our history, I can think of nothing more American than an immigrant.": "Conor",

  "I think if you come from a history of persecution you have to develop a sense of humour.": "Sacha",
  "In the 2000 presidential election, Al Gore got more votes than George W. Bush, but still lost the election. The Supreme Court's ruling in Florida gave Bush that pivotal state, and doomed Gore to lose the Electoral College. That odd scenario - where the candidate with the most votes loses - has happened three times in U.S. history.": "Juan",
  "The invention of the printing press was one of the most important events in human history.": "Ha-Joon",
  "If a strong government finds that it can, with impunity, destroy a weak people, then the hour has struck for that weak people to appeal to the League of Nations to give its judgment in all freedom. God and history will remember your judgment.": "Haile",

  "Hegel was right when he said that we learn from history that man can never learn anything from history.": "George",
  "The 4th Amendment and the personal rights it secures have a long history. At the very core stands the right of a man to retreat into his own home and there be free from unreasonable governmental intrusion.": "Potter",
  "The very concept of history implies the scholar and the reader. Without a generation of civilized people to study history, to preserve its records, to absorb its lessons and relate them to its own problems, history, too, would lose its meaning.": "George",

  "I'm a good son, a good father, a good husband - I've been married to the same woman for 30 years. I'm a good friend. I finished college, I have my education, I donate money anonymously. So when people criticize the kind of characters that I play on screen, I go, 'You know, that's part of history.'": "Samuel",
  "The '80s were fabulous. The '90s sucked, and the '70s were just a sad, sad time in human history. Go 1980s! There's something that's just so cute about that time. And not just yellow nail polish and 'I'm a loner.'": "Jennifer",
  "Culinary tradition is not always based on fact. Sometimes it's based on history, on habits that come out of a time when kitchens were fueled by charcoal.": "Alton",

  "I'm not one of those who wants to purge our society of our Christian history.": "Richard",

  "I am totally fascinated by people and our history as I understand and continue to explore it. People have so much to give and so far to go and yet we have given and gone a great distance. It's really just interesting to ask: why not? And see where that takes me.": "Nikki",
  "The process of making natural history films is to try to prevent the animal knowing you are there, so you get glimpses of a non-human world, and that is a transporting thing.": "David",
  "The lesson of history is that you do not get a sustained economic recovery as long as the financial system is in crisis.": "Ben",
  "I know that many of you do wear such a cross of Christ, not in any ostentatious way, not in a way that might harm you at your work or recreation, but a simple indication that you value the role of Jesus Christ in the history of the world, that you are trying to live by Christ's standards in your own daily life.": "Keith",
  "What would be the nicest thing I could say about Newt Gingrich? He may be one of the great supporters of the humanities, because you have people who don't want to study the social sciences, because it's not profitable, and now Newt, as the highest-paid historian in American history, may be an encouragement to people to study history.": "Barney",

  "Optimists are usually wrong. But all the great change in history, positive change, was done by optimists.": "Thomas",
  "As nations we should also commit afresh to righting past wrongs. In Australia we began this recently with the first Australians - the oldest continuing culture in human history. On behalf of the Australian Parliament, this year I offered an apology to indigenous Australians for the wrongs they had suffered in the past.": "Kevin",
  "The message of Passover remains as powerful as ever. Freedom is won not on the battlefield but in the classroom and the home. Teach your children the history of freedom if you want them never to lose it.": "Jonathan",
  "The hallmark of our times is change and acceleration, but we have to provide the history.": "Jim",
  "The moment that changed me for ever was when I had my first seminar with my history professor at the University of Sussex. I realised that history would answer all the questions I had spent my life asking. It was an extraordinary moment.": "Philippa",
  "I once won a second prize in a history concert. My parents came to the ceremony. Somebody else had won the prize for best all-around student. Afterwards my father said to me, 'Never, ever disgrace me like that again.' When I tell my Western friends, they are aghast. But I adore my father. It didn't knock my self-esteem at all.": "Amy",
  "No back in the history of football was ever worth two fumbles a game.": "Woody",
  "Open your refrigerator door, and you summon forth more light than the total amount enjoyed by most households in the 18th century. The world at night, for much of history, was a very dark place indeed.": "Bill",
  "If we look at American history, between 1942 and 1947, the data that was collected by the Census Bureau was handed over to the FBI and other organizations at the request of President Roosevelt, and that's how the Japanese were rounded up and put into the internment camps.": "Michele",
  "The thing that interests me most about family history is the gap between the things we think we know about our families and the realities.": "Jeremy",

  "Elimination of illiteracy is as serious an issue to our history as the abolition of slavery.": "Maya",
  "Yes, the Bible should be taught in our schools because it is necessary to understand the Bible if we are to truly understand our own culture and how it came to be. The Bible has influenced every part of western culture from our art, music, and history, to our sense of fairness, charity, and business.": "Joel",
  "Personally, my interests are ancient history and ancient civilizations. In my own life, I'd like to go to places like Easter Island.": "Nicolas",
  "Captain Cook discovered Australia looking for the Terra Incognita. Christopher Columbus thought he was finding India but discovered America. History is full of events that happened because of an imaginary tale.": "Umberto",
  "History is rich with adventurous men, long on charisma, with a highly developed instinct for their own interests, who have pursued personal power - bypassing parliaments and constitutions, distributing favours to their minions, and conflating their own desires with the interests of the community.": "Umberto",
  "In the digital universe, our personal history and its sense of narrative is succeeded by our social networking profile - a snapshot of the current moment. The information itself - our social graph of friends and likes - is a product being sold to market researchers in order to better predict and guide our futures.": "Douglas",

  "Bulls don't read. Bears read financial history. As markets fall to bits, the bears dust off the Dutch tulip mania of 1637, the Banque Royale of 1719-20, the railway speculation of the 1840s, the great crash of 1929.": "James",
  "Black history isn't a separate history. This is all of our history, this is American history, and we need to understand that. It has such an impact on kids and their values and how they view black people.": "Karyn",
  "Mankind has probably done more damage to the Earth in the 20th century than in all of previous human history.": "Jacques",

  "If given a chance, I would really want to explore the monuments in Delhi, like Qutub Minar and the forts. I have been there as a child, but now I want to go back and understand the history and significance behind them. We take all of these things for granted in life.": "Shreya",

  "The importance of the river cannot be overstated in the history of the country, or the development of the nation.": "Maurice",
  "History is a race between education and catastrophe.": "H.",

  "History is full of examples of regimes that were oppressing at home and aggressive abroad, and I can't think of too many liberal democracies engaging in counterfeiting, drug running, missile proliferation, and just about any other illegal activity you can think of as North Korea does.": "Ed",
  "The travail of freedom and justice is not easy, but nothing serious and important in life is easy. The history of humanity has been a continuing struggle against temptation and tyranny - and very little worthwhile has ever been achieved without pain.": "Robert",
  "The time is coming when the pressure of population on the means of subsistence will be felt here as it is now felt in Europe and Asia. Then will the world enter upon a new stage of its history - the final competition of races, for which the Anglo-Saxon is being schooled.": "Josiah",
  "Nowhere else in history has there ever been a flag that stands for the right to burn itself. This is the fractal of our flag. It stands for the right to destroy itself.": "Ken",

  "This is an exciting time. A new chapter in our history.": "John",
  "History is full of examples of people who clamp down after they began to enjoy too much freedom. Freedom can lead to instability, anarchy, and confusion. So there can be a moral counter-revolution.": "Gary",

  "My opinion is that politicians should be humble in the face of history. And whenever history is a matter of debate, it should be left in the hands of historians and experts.": "Shinzo",

  "If you go back far enough and get a wider enough picture of history, we have let go of many things that follow a religious narrative. We don't burn witches anymore.

  "Literature overtakes history, for literature gives you more than one life. It expands experience and opens new opportunities to readers.": "Carlos",
  "There are constant cycles in history. There is loss, but it is always followed by regeneration. The tales of our elders who remember such cycles are very important to us now.": "Carmen",
  "Hold those things that tell your history and protect them. During slavery, who was able to read or write or keep anything? The ability to have somebody to tell your story to is so important. It says: 'I was here. I may be sold tomorrow. But you know I was here.'": "Maya",
  "The whole westward expansion myth is seen as romantic. But it's a joke, a blot on American history.": "Frank",
  "Time is my greatest enemy.": "Evita",

  "I would put our legislative and foreign policy accomplishments in our first two years against any president - with the possible exceptions of Johnson, FDR, and Lincoln - just in terms of what we've gotten done in modern history. But, you know, but when it comes to the economy, we've got a lot more work to do. And we're gonna keep on at it.": "Barack",

  "You know, I think the, the crucial thing, you know, we have put in place what is, is just simply the biggest, boldest recovery package in history, right; the stimulus package, biggest ever; the financial rescue, absolutely comprehensive; a housing plan - that is incredible medicine for the economy. And we fully expect it to work.": "Christina",
  "I'm very comfortable with where history will judge me.": "Ted",
  "The Gospel is not a theory the Gospel is not a philosophy or an idea the Gospel is not a way of thinking or feeling. The Gospel is an event in history.": "John",

  "Any good broadcast, not just an Olympic broadcast, should have texture to it. It should have information, should have some history, should have something that's offbeat, quirky, humorous, and where called for it, should have journalism, and judiciously it should also have commentary. That's my ideal.": "Bob",
  "What has made America amazing has been the fact that throughout our history, throughout the more than 200 years of our history, there have been men and women of courage who stood up and decided it was more important to look out for the future of their children and their grandchildren than their own political futures.": "Scott",
  "So many struggled so that all of us could have a voice in this great democracy and live up to the first three words of our constitution: We the people. I love that phrase so much.

  "Life, it is true, can be grasped in all its confused futility merely by opening one's eyes and sitting passively, a spectator on the stands of history - but to understand the social processes and conflicts, the interplay between individual and group, even the physicality of human experience, we have need of small-scale models.": "Will",
  "In the history of mankind there are recorded two great Inversions. The first, set forth by the Nazarene to the effect that love is a greater power and more real than vengeance.

  "When I saw that Wrestlemania had broken an indoor attendance record, I just walked into a wrestling office, Championship Wrestling in Florida, during the offseason, and they introduced me to Hiro Matsuda, who became my mentor... and the rest is history!": "Lex",
  "The naturalist worldview is a good way to feel grounded and feel part of something that isn't based on fairy tales. It's based on observable facts in the human and in the biological history of the planet. I think that can be a source for comfort.": "Greg",
  "In the 7th grade, I made a 20-foot long mural of the Lewis and Clark Trail while we were studying that in history because I knew I wasn't going to be able to spit back the names and the dates and all that stuff on a test.": "Chuck",
  "History is moving the furniture around in the house of mankind just about everywhere but the U.S.A. Things have changed, except here, where people come and go through the rooms of state, and everything looks shabbier by the day, and lethargy eats away at the upholstery like an acid fog, and the walls reverberate with meaningless oratory.": "James",
  "The history of American agriculture suggests that you can have transformation without a master plan, without knowing all the answers up front.": "Atul",
  "No period of history has ever been great or ever can be that does not act on some sort of high, idealistic motives, and idealism in our time has been shoved aside, and we are paying the penalty for it.": "Alfred",

  "If you review the commercial history, you will discover anyone who controls oriental trade will get hold of global wealth.": "James",

  "OUR history begins before we are born. We represent the hereditary influences of our race, and our ancestors virtually live in us.": "James",
  "You should read history and look at ostracism, persecution, martyrdom, and that kind of thing. They always happen to the best men, you know.": "George",
  "I had a go at changing history - maybe not all by myself - I fought at the battle of Normandy, I slogged through the Ardennes, and I celebrated the liberation of Paris on the streets with beautiful French girls throwing flowers at me. I said good-bye to my first true love and discovered what I really wanted to do with my life.": "LeRoy",

  "The judicial system is the most expensive machine ever invented for finding out what happened and what to do about it.": "Irving",
  "France, and the whole of Europe have a great culture and an amazing history. Most important thing though is that people there know how to live! In America they've forgotten all about it. I'm afraid that the American culture is a disaster.": "Johnny",

  "Yes, we've seen it all before. And yes, those who do not study history are condemned to repeat it. But no, the sky is not falling - baseball is such a great game that neither the owners nor the players can kill it. After some necessary carnage, market forces will prevail.": "John",
  "True there has been more talk of peace since 1945 than, I should think, at any other time in history. At least we hear more and read more about it because man's words, for good or ill, can now so easily reach the millions.": "Lester",

  "The common people have no history: persecuted by the present, they cannot think of preserving the memory of the past.": "Jean",
  "The only history is a mere question of one's struggle inside oneself. But that is the joy of it. One need neither discover Americas nor conquer nations, and yet one has as great a work as Columbus or Alexander, to do.": "D.",

  "I don't think we handled the aftermath of the fall of Baghdad as well as we might have. But that's now history.": "Colin",
  "Remember our proud history of social justice, universal health care, public pensions and making sure no one is left behind. Let's continue to move forward.": "Jack",
  "Storytelling in general is a communal act. Throughout human history, people would gather around, whether by the fire or at a tavern, and tell stories. One person would chime in, then another, maybe someone would repeat a story they heard already but with a different spin. It's a collective process.": "Joseph",

  "In a typical history book, black Americans are mentioned in the context of slavery or civil rights. There's so much more to the story.": "Kareem",
  "China is an old nation with a colourful history. Its booming economy has triggered an appetite and a curiosity around the world for its art and culture, one that continues to grow. I can, however, tell people that it is a show with no actor.": "Ai",
  "'WASP' is the only ethnic term that is in fact a term of class, apart from redneck, which is another word for the same group but who are in the lower social strata, so it's inexplicably tied up with social standing and culture and history in a way that the other hyphenations just are not.": "Christopher",

  "When I ran the stock exchange, it was the most successful it's been in its 200-plus-year history. And I was rewarded for success; I would not have been rewarded if we failed.": "Richard",
  "Look at what has occurred in history. When the Berlin Wall fell, it was not surprising, but it was unexpected. Who predicted the Arab Spring? Nobody expected it, but all the ingredients were there. I think all the ingredients are also there for Quebec to become a country. But when? That's another question.": "Gilles",
  "In fact, the Senkaku Islands are... inherent territory of Japan that is recognized in our history and also by international law.": "Naoto",
  "English has been this vacuum cleaner of a language, because of its history meeting up with the Romans and then the Danes, the Vikings and then the French and then the Renaissance with all the Latin and Greek and Hebrew in the background.": "David",
  "You know, when we get to a point in this country where dissent is extremism, we've turned, I think, a very dark page in our history. And I don't want us to go there. I encourage Americans and I'm - right now, to go to these town hall meetings, to - to talk to your Congressmen, the people that you elected.": "Michael",
  "I've always been a history lover. I've spent a lot of recreational time walking around historical castles and estates, in Britain and Europe, and so I know what the real thing looks like.": "Natalie",
  "The history of American patriotism is figuring out ways that we can work together to move forward and knit together the common government.": "Taylor",

  "History laughs at both the victim and the aggressor.": "Mahmoud",
  "Television has given Pakistan a truly open national forum for the first time in its history. Ideas are debated, leaders are assessed and criticised, and a nation of 170 million people is finally discovering, together, what it thinks.": "Mohsin",
  "History will treat me right.": "Ralph",
  "South Africa never leaves one indifferent. Its history, its population, its landscapes and cultures - all speak to the visitor, to the student, to the friend of Africa.": "Tariq",
  "When the early Europeans first met Africans, at the crossroads of history, it was a respectful meeting and the Africans were not slaves. Their nations were old before Europe was born.": "John",
  "Ideologists of all kinds find a strange sort of comfort in the madness of the crowd; it confirms them in their suspicion that history, far from being made by the great mass of individuals - as Marx averred - is rather unmade by a single massive individual, a collective Other, who stands in stark contrast to you and he.": "Will",
  "It is unfortunate that so much of the history of Africa has been written by conquerors, foreigners, missionaries and adventurers. The Egyptians left the best record of their history written by local writers.": "John",
  "I am a nationalist, and a Pan-Africanist, first and foremost. I was well grounded in history before ever taking a history course. I did not spend much formal time in school - I had to work.": "John",
  "Since the middle of the 20th century, more has been learnt about the ocean than during all preceding human history; at the same time, more has been lost.": "Sylvia",
  "Winning the Super Bowl was obviously a great one, but the joy I felt of going to the Super Bowl, it was what I felt about the Pittsburgh Steelers and where we came from, the history of us to that point.": "Joe",
  "One of the core ideas of the Bible is that meaning can be found in history. The sheer act of telling and retelling stories helps us to understand God's role in the world as well as our own position in a long line of ancestors who have wrestled with similar issues to the ones we wrestle with every day.": "Bruce",
  "Knowing more about family history is the single biggest predictor of a child's emotional well-being. Grandparents can play a special role in this process, too.": "Bruce",
  "I'm not saying this in a condescending kind of way, but it's quite simple: The making of America was a heroic thing. Australia has a much murkier, much more complex view of its history. It's just full of all these open wounds we don't really know what to do with.": "Nick",
  "What the history of aviation has brought in the 20th century should inspire us to be inventors and explorers ourselves in the new century.": "Bertrand",
  "It's so important for people to pay attention to history and learn from it, because it's the only thing we've got that's going to help us figure out where we are going. Especially the way things are manipulated in the press today. You have to sort through so much stuff to figure out what is real and what is not. It gets harder every day.": "Joe",
  "The news media is so quick to pick up tragic stories of imperiled children that it seems like there are more terrible events today than ever before - when in fact it's quite the opposite. It is, in all manners possible to calculate, the safest time in the history of civilization to be a kid.": "Gever",

  "At no time in history have we succeeded in making, in a timely fashion, a specific vaccine for more than 260 million people.": "Laurie",
  "I have a unique history. There's no way to ever separate what your life would have been like if you had taken a different path. You have to embrace what is yours, and if you don't like it, you have to decide to change it.": "Eve",
  "The lessons of history would suggest that civilisations move in cycles. You can track that back quite far - the Babylonians, the Sumerians, followed by the Egyptians, the Romans, China. We're obviously in a very upward cycle right now, and hopefully that remains the case. But it may not.": "Elon",
  "I love New York, but I have to admit that I feel very English, and I do miss that sense of history that you have everywhere in Britain.": "Charlie",
  "When I was a boy, I would ask about my family history, about my bloodlines. We really didn't know that much. We had a little Indian in us from the Oklahoma Trail of Tears.": "Brad",
  "The question I'm always asking myself is: are we masters or victims? Do we make history, or does history make us? Do we shape the world, or are we just shaped by it? The question of do we have agency in our lives or whether we are just passive victims of events is, I think, a great question, and one that I have always tried to ask.": "Salman",
  "The aim of God in history is the creation of an all-inclusive community of loving persons with God himself at the very heart of this community as its prime Sustainer and most glorious Inhabitant.": "Dallas",

  "When 'Midnight's Children' came out, people in the West tended to respond to the fantasy elements in the novel, to praise it in those terms. In India, people read it like a history book.": "Salman",

  "Psychology keeps trying to vindicate human nature. History keeps undermining the effort.": "Mason",
  "As every student in Philosophy 101 learns, nothing can force me to believe that anyone except me is conscious. This power to deny that other people have feelings is not just an academic exercise but an all-too-common vice, as we see in the long history of human cruelty.": "Steven",
  "Religions, which condemn the pleasures of sense, drive men to seek the pleasures of power. Throughout history power has been the vice of the ascetic.": "Bertrand",

  "When someone tells me about Malala, the girl who was shot by the Taliban - that's my definition for her - I don't think she's me. Now I don't even feel as if I was shot. Even my life in Swat feels like a part of history or a movie I watched. Things change. God has given us a brain and a heart which tell us how to live.": "Malala",
  "Judging from the main portions of the history of the world, so far, justice is always in jeopardy.": "Walt",

  "The Carter Center has the only existing international taskforce on disease eradication. Which means a total elimination of a disease on the face of the Earth.

  "A war still rages over the legacy of the 1960s.": "Camille",
  "Strip malls are history.": "Jeff",
  "What's it like to envision the ten-thousand-year environmental impact of tossing a plastic bottle into the trash bin, all in the single second it takes to actually toss it? Or the ten-thousand-year history of the fossil fuel being burned to drive to work or iron a shirt? It may be environmentally progressive, but it's not altogether pleasant.": "Douglas",

  "I let the American people down.": "Richard",
  "Life isn't meant to be easy. It's hard to take being on the top - or on the bottom. I guess I'm something of a fatalist. You have to have a sense of history, I think, to survive some of these things... Life is one crisis after another.": "Richard",

  "The Russians feared Ike. They didn't fear me.": "Lyndon",
  "The Marine Corps is the Navy's police force and as long as I am President that is what it will remain. They have a propaganda machine that is almost equal to Stalin's.": "Harry",
  "I realise that I do not change the course of history. I am an actor, I do a movie, that's the end of it. You have to realise we are just clowns for hire. After I had success it was great, at first, not to worry about money. It was on my mind when I was growing up.": "Leonardo",

  "Over the years, more than one reviewer has described my fantasy series, 'A Song of Ice and Fire', as historical fiction about history that never happened, flavoured with a dash of sorcery and spiced with dragons. I take that as a compliment.": "George",
  "Imagination is always the fabric of social life and the dynamic of history. The influence of real needs and compulsions, of real interests and materials, is indirect because the crowd is never conscious of it.": "Simone",

  "History develops, art stands still.": "E.",
  "The Arctic is a place that historically, during all preceding human history, has largely been an icy realm with an impact on ocean currents.

  "Every library should try to be complete on something, if it were only the history of pinheads.": "Oliver",
  "You that would judge me, do not judge alone this book or that, come to this hallowed place where my friends' portraits hang and look thereon; Ireland's history in their lineaments trace; think where man's glory most begins and ends and say my glory was I had such friends.": "William",
  "I don't know the history of my sport. I'm not like those people who know everything.": "Usain",

  "History is always changing behind us, and the past changes a little every time we retell it.": "Hilary",
  "But I think it's more that when you're young, you're invincible, you're immortal - or at least you think you are. The possibilities are limitless, you're inventing the future. Then you get older and suddenly you have a history. It's fixed. You can't change anything. I find that a bit disturbing, to be honest.": "Damien",
  "Religious belief, like history itself, is a story that is always unfolding, always subject to inquiry and ripe for questioning. For without doubt there is no faith.": "Jon",

  "Every society in the history of man has upheld the institution of marriage as a bond between a man and a woman. Why? Because society is based on one thing: that society is based on the future of the society. And that's what? Children. Monogamous relationships.": "Rick",

  "I spend much more time looking at art history and at different references to art than I do at actual objects.": "Jeff",

  "Chaos often breeds life, when order breeds habit.": "Henry",

  "I think when I first realized that something interesting had happened was probably in 1994. There was a 25th anniversary of the ARPANET celebration and... somebody asked the question, 'Where did email come from?' I remembered that I had done this little program back in 1971.

  "I was given such a great gift. It's a miracle that never stops amazing me and reminding me to give thanks, every day. Having a wife and daughter gives me a lot more purpose.

  "Exercise is amazing, from the inside out. I feel so alive and have more energy.": "Vanessa",

  "When you're true to who you are, amazing things happen.": "Deborah",

  "There are amazingly wonderful people in all walks of life some familiar to us and others not. Stretch yourself and really get to know people. People are in many ways one of our greatest treasures.": "Bryant",
  "One of the most amazing things about mathematics is the people who do math aren't usually interested in application, because mathematics itself is truly a beautiful art form. It's structures and patterns, and that's what we love, and that's what we get off on.": "Danica",

  "It is quite amazing how hard the subconscious works when it is made to understand that this life is not a rehearsal, there is no safety net and no assurance of any final closure.

  "It's the most amazing thing to be able to forgive.": "Carrie",

  "It's amazing to me that young people will still pick up a cigarette.": "Loni",
  "Every time you get into a new job, new location, you have an amazing opportunity in front of you. You get to play dumb for as long as people will allow you to play dumb.

  "In the 20th century, we had a century where at the beginning of the century, most of the world was agricultural and industry was very primitive.

  "When you lose a parent, you realize how vital they are to the foundation of your life. It's impossible to understand what it means until that curtain is pulled. You're an orphan.

  "I think having children is the most amazing thing.": "Rachel",

  "Did you ever spell a word so bad that your spell check has absolutely no clue what you're trying to spell? What do you end up getting, you end up getting, like, a question mark. You got a million dollars of technology just looking back at you like, 'You got me, buddy. Which is pretty amazing because I have all the words.'": "Bill",
  "I tend not to wear accessories. I'm not one of those gals with a drawerful of amazing jewelry. I don't even have my ears pierced! But I have one bracelet that never comes off my wrist.": "Rachael",
  "Propaganda is amazing. People can be led to believe anything.": "Alice",
  "I don't see the desert as barren at all; I see it as full and ripe. It doesn't need to be flattered with rain. It certainly needs rain, but it does with what it has, and creates amazing beauty.": "Joy",

  "You get moments all the time that kind of make you pinch yourself, some of them make you quite emotional. Winning a BRIT was a big moment because we were just so excited to be at the awards in the first place. Selling out Madison Square Garden was pretty amazing too. Then we woke to the news that our UK tour was sold out. It was crazy.": "Harry",

  "I'm an amazing mama's boy.": "Penn",
  "When you look at the calculation, it's amazing that every time you try to prove or disprove time travel, you've pushed Einstein's theory to the very limits where quantum effects must dominate. That's telling us that you really need a theory of everything to resolve this question. And the only candidate is string theory.": "Michio",
  "I love chicken. I love chicken products: fried chicken, roasted chicken, chicken nuggets - whatever. And going to Japan, I would see that these chicken were smoked and then grilled and then have this amazing crispy skin.": "David",

I look forward to working with our leadership team and employees worldwide to continue our proud legacy while moving even faster into ultra-mobility to lead Intel into the next era.": "Brian",
  "I had very little fear about it, but basically, my straight friends talked me out of it. I think they thought as I was bisexual, there was no need to. But it's amazing how much more complicated it became because I didn't come out in the early days. I often wonder if my career would have taken a different path if I had.": "George",
  "I am indeed amazed when I consider how weak my mind is and how prone to error.": "Rene",

  "In Singapore, there is this life and locals and restaurants and then big casinos and an array of chefs, and even Miami is almost close to Vegas when it comes to an amazing presentation of chefs. But they don't have these massive hotels that have become their own culinary villages.": "Daniel",
  "For me, I don't expect to have a really amazing meal each time I dine out. Having a good meal with your loved ones - that's what makes the experience.": "Wolfgang",
  "I'm not that good looking... nobody is that good looking. I have seen a lot of movie stars, and maybe four are amazing looking. The rest have a team of gay guys who make it happen.": "Tina",
  "When I was seven or eight years old, I began to read the science-fiction magazines that were brought by guests into my grandparents' boarding house in Waukegan, Illinois.

  "Sometimes, reading my own media, the negativity can upset me, but I just deal with things on a positive basis. I mean, I have up to 20,000 people singing my words back to me on a nightly basis - they share my hopes and fears, and they relate to my own life experiences. Life can be pretty isolating, but that connection is always amazing.": "James",
  "Watching a company develop is like watching a puppy grow. When you can watch something grow that you created - it's really an amazing feeling.": "Brody",

  "It's amazing how confused and distracted and misdirected so many people are.": "Stephen",
  "The Southbank Centre Unlimited Festival was a distinct moment in time, an amazing counterpoint to the London 2012 Paralympics.

  "My father is an amazing person. While he was a huge star, he never carried his stardom home and always remained simple and just our father at home.

  "Nothing is more generally known than our duties which belong to Christianity; and yet, how amazing is it, nothing is less practiced?": "George",

  "Strangely enough, when the Sugababes' 'Freak Like Me' went to number 1, which was built around my 'Are 'Friends' Electric' song, I had another song called 'Rip' go to number 1 in the Kerrang TV chart, so I was pulling new people in from very different areas of musical interest.

  "I played rugby for years, and I had a rugby jacket that I lost when I was 14. Somehow, my brother found it in storage 15 years later, and he gave it back to me for my 30th birthday. That was amazing and probably one of the best gifts I've ever received.": "Ryan",
  "We are the most amazing creatures that this world has ever produced, but we seem to also have this herd mentality; we seem to be the most stupid, also.": "Vivienne",
  "I grew up listening in awe to stories of their wartime adventures. My granny, Joan, was a journalist and wrote amazing letters to my grandpa when he was a prisoner of war, while my nana, Mary, was a Land Girl, then a Wren. They were so independent, resilient and glamorous.": "Laura",
  "Seven hundred thousand people who have dementia in this country are not heard. I'm fortunate; I can be heard. Regrettably, it's amazing how people listen if you stand up in public and give away $1 million for research into the disease, as I have done.": "Terry",

  "It is amazing how a new child can refocus one's direction seconds after its birth.": "David",

All of a sudden they seem bigger, and they seem smarter, and they feel good about it, too.": "Peggy",
  "I really like even numbers, and I like heavily divisible numbers. Twelve is my lucky number - I just love how divisible it is. I don't like odd numbers, and I really don't like primes.

  "The lesson of travel seems to be so banal, but so great, which is that people are just so amazingly decent the world over. Given the disparity of income and wealth, it's amazing not just that you don't get robbed everywhere - it's amazing you don't get eaten.": "Geoff",
  "I owe my career to Latina women. I was surrounded by the amazing group: my mother, my aunts, my extended family. They didn't necessarily have access to high fashion, but they had great style and looked stunning naturally at every age.": "Narciso",

  "I've had an amazing life, but I think I was born with a little bit of sadness in me. I've always been attracted to those things, whether it's sad movies, sad music... when you're sad, you feel everything in a greater way than you do when you're happy.": "Sam",
  "My fantasy is that I could wake up looking amazing, that I could be strong and stop the bully, but that everybody would love me, too. I think that's intrinsic to fantasy - fantasy is fantasy.": "Patty",

  "From my mom telling me 'no' to now telling everyone I'm the champion, and she's so proud of me, and to prove to a lot of people - who didn't believe in me, who didn't think I was going to be here - that I'm here, and I did it. It's been a roller coaster of emotions; it's amazing.": "Sasha",
  "Yes, the companionship is amazing. You know, you can get that physical attraction that happens is great, but then there's an awful lot of time and the rest of the day that you have to fill.": "Vince",
  "I just feel energized when I am around young, talented people. There is something about these kids that's amazing. I learn as much from them as they do from me.": "Sally",
  "There are very few dance companies in the world and you have to be phenomenal. You have to not be injured. You have to have a really strong mind to deal with the dance world. People who can do it are amazing to me. You cannot have a life outside of dance.": "Neve",
  "I can't believe it. I'm speechless. It is amazing to see where I've come from the last two years.": "Libby",
  "I swim like a fish and I have an amazing kick.": "Gordon",
  "The U.S.S. George H. W. Bush is a great thing in my life. It's amazing. A great honor.": "George",

  "'Hell is for Children' is amazing to do every night and 'Promises in the Dark' and 'Love Is a Battlefied,' of course, but my absolute favorite would be 'Heartbreaker.' It's the one that started everything, so it has a very special place in my heart. And it still rocks every night! It's so fun to do.": "Pat",
  "You get to a point where the kind of beautiful chaos can't really fuel your creative existence any longer because it's not stable, however amazing and exciting it may be.": "Kaki",
  "I truly loved being pregnant and feeling what was going on inside my body and watching it change. It's difficult to recoup, but still amazing nonetheless. I would have another one.": "Jill",

  "I have had the most wonderful childhood, and I was raised in a very loving family. And it was nothing short of an amazing privilege because I was incredibly lucky to be able to play up in trees and make it like silly dens in a bush and stuff like that.": "Rose",
  "As you eat more healthily, your palate changes - it's amazing. Your taste buds constantly adapt: from minute to minute, in fact. If you drank orange juice right now, it would taste sweet. But if you first ate some sweets then drank the same juice, it could taste unpleasantly bitter.": "Michael",
  "There are a few elements - especially platinum and palladium - that have the amazing ability to absorb up to 900 times their own volume in hydrogen gas. To get a sense of the scale there, that's roughly equivalent to a 250-pound man swallowing something the size of a dozen African bull elephants and not gaining an inch on his waistline.": "Sam",
  "Sometimes I have ice cream for lunch. Gelateria Sempione in Milan is the best in the world, hands down. The chocolate sorbetto is amazing.": "Margherita",

  "I feel like I have had the most amazing life in my public service.": "Hillary",
  "Being a mom, it feels like I did something so powerful and amazing. It's such a gigantic blessing, and a confirmation that the Creator exists. And all of that has made me feel sexier and stronger. I call it 'lava in my spine.'": "Jill",
  "The paradox of Steve Jobs's career is that he had no interest in listening to consumers - he was famously dismissive of market research - yet nonetheless had an amazing sense of what consumers actually wanted.": "James",
  "The right really dominates radio, and it's amazing how much energy the right spends telling us that the press is slanted to the left when it really isn't. They want to shut other people up. They really don't understand the First Amendment.": "Roger",
  "There was always music in our home. My mom and my dad loved music. I remember when we were kids we would have these great parties at the house with congas and bongos and African drums, and it was amazing. It wasn't until years later that I found out that they were actually Black Panther meetings.": "Queen",

  "It's amazing because people come up to me and say, 'Chuck, you're the luckiest guy in the world to be a world karate champion and a movie and TV star.' When they say this to me, I kind of smile because luck had nothing to do with it; God had everything to do with it.": "Chuck",

  "The amount of control you have over somebody if you can monitor internet activity is amazing.": "Tim",
  "People inspire me. Every day, I meet amazing individuals in the field. When I see a mother who has walked for three weeks to come to a MSF clinic, with two kids on her back and her belongings on her head, facing intimidation and physical abuse on her way, I am inspired by her resilience - her desire for life.": "Joanne",
  "I've always been a big fan of Mariah Carey. I think it's her personality. As much as she has an amazing voice, she has a crazy personality and I love the fact that she's not afraid to hide that.": "Jessica",
  "The difference between Marilyn Monroe and the early Pamela Anderson is not that great. What's amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same.": "Hugh",
  "It's very intense to be in front of a live audience. It's just an amazing experience. It's dangerous. Everything out there is heightened. The bad stuff is extra-worse. The silences are extra-silent. The good stuff is amazing. It's electric when you walk out there. For 90 minutes, you're on this other planet.": "Steven",
  "Wonder Woman was my favorite superhero as a little girl. I still have a huge girl crush on Wonder Woman I think she's amazing.": "Evangeline",
  "I'm an amazing cook. And I'm a gentleman but can belch the entire alphabet. Classy.": "Jussie",
  "The whole process of being one of the 10 finalists for the 'Vogue' Fashion Fund award has to be my biggest achievement to date. Meeting Anna Wintour, Diane von Furstenberg, etc., has been an amazing experience that even now gives me goose bumps when I think about it.": "Simon",
  "What's amazing is that the taste of American men and international tastes in terms of beauty have essentially stayed the same. Styles change, but our view of beauty stays the same.": "Hugh",
  "I'm quite proud of what I anticipated about reality television from my books in the early '90s, which I based on the early seasons of 'Cops' and on the amazing stuff I had read about happening on Japanese shows and the British 'Big Brother'.": "William",
  "When you have an audience standing and screaming the entire way through the short program and cheering every element you do, whether it's footwork, or spin, or a jump, to have that kind of emotion coming at you from every direction in the building, it's the most amazing sensation you can get as a sportsman.": "Johnny",
  "Growing up, I had a terrible pudding-bowl haircut. I used to cut it myself, and I'd sew my own clothing, too. I looked a little strange compared to the other kids. But the thing was, I felt I looked amazing, so what other people thought never bothered me.": "Becki",
  "I don't think with any book you get used to people falling in love with the story. It's been incredible just to realize your books are being read. It's a pretty amazing feeling.": "Jennifer",
  "I feel like I've lost so many amazing traits because I've listened to stupid people, ignorant people who are bullies.": "Kylie",
  "When the shriveled skin of the ordinary is stuffed out with meaning, it satisfies the senses amazingly.": "Virginia",
  "If it's an amazing role, I'll do anything.": "Vin",
  "Obviously, there's the seedy side of the strip club world and pole dancing. But, pole dancing, as an art form, is really beautiful. It's been hyper-sexualized because it's associated with strippers, but if you think about it, just in terms of other kinds of dancing, they're using an instrument to create these amazing dance forms.": "Megalyn",
  "I was really lucky that, through my 20s, I got to work with some amazing people, and I tried to sit back and watch and learn.": "James",
  "To get a horse to hit a mark without a rider, to get it to stand up, to get it to rear, to get it to pick up a bucket and bring it over is amazing. It's hard work and very rewarding but can be dangerous.": "Benedict",
  "Society tends to always make multiples - whether it's twins or triplets or whatever - one person. And it's not always fair. I encourage multiples to embrace their individual uniqueness because, just as you are an amazing unit together, that can only happen when you are strong individually.": "Tia",
  "The satisfaction you get when you finally beat your dad is amazing, that rush of adrenaline.": "Lee",
  "I love Benny Hill. He one of my favourites of aaall time. Like, the way Benny did it, he was just amazing. Just seeing how he put songs together and comedy and the timing and the sketches. He was way ahead of his time.": "Snoop",
  "I don't think I'm such an amazing person who needs to be written about.": "Amy",
  "I love kimonos because you can just throw them on over anything. Ever since I got my first kimono from Lane Bryant in high school and thought, 'This is amazing; I can wear it with everything!'": "Lizzo",

  "I love to go shopping at Target. They have so much stuff there, you can buy almost anything, it's really amazing.": "Liv",
  "After I finished high school I went to Hong Kong and Thailand and spent some time there. Just to get that whole experience of being out of the bubble that I was in from high school in Vancouver, to be able to travel around and be on your own was an amazing experience.": "Shay",
  "It is extraordinary how safe flying has become. You are now statistically more likely to be elected president of the United States in your lifetime than you are to die in a plane crash. What an amazing achievement as a society! But what we end up focusing on are the catastrophic failures that are incredibly rare but happen every now and then.": "Steven",
  "If I could film, we'd film every episode of 'Doctor Who' in New York. I have an affinity with the city. It has some wonderful locations and it is devastatingly vast and huge. Central Park looks amazing on camera.": "Matt",
  "When you can watch something grow that you created - it's really an amazing feeling.": "Brody",
  "My biggest lesson I've learned about love is to keep on loving. Love is love it's amazing. It's fine. It hurts. It's probably one of the best experiences in life. ": "Christina",
  "Creating something new is the difficult part. To make it and build it and get everyone to follow? Amazing.": "Pep",
  "I put the costume on and said 'It's not very comfortable, but it looks amazing,' so it's all good.": "Chris",

  "To win one Moonman is amazing, to win two is incredible.": "Harry",
  "I think there's something really freeing about improv, that it's a collective, creative, in-the-moment piece. That's really exciting and really frustrating, because it's there and gone. There's an amazing interaction with the audience that happens because they are very much another scene partner.": "Tatiana",
  "You arrive at Formula One being very skeptical, how far can your talent deal with all this, and then you understand those guys are human and pretty reasonable, and finally succeeding in winning your first race, in circumstance as such, it was just an amazing moment.": "Michael",
  "Musicians like James Blake were a big influence on me. How he uses his vocals is amazing. And then Yeasayer and Animal Collective, who aren't pop bands exactly, but they do something that is so catchy and undeniable and so much fun.": "Lorde",
  "'Amazing Grace' is not a book of interviews or onetime snapshots. It's a memoir of a journey that took me into a place I had never been and took over two years of my life. I don't think the people in this book would have said the things to me that they did if they perceived me as a reporter.": "Jonathan",
  "Just know that as long as your family thinks you're amazing, then you really are amazing.": "Sabrina",
  "I don't claim to be a particularly good father. I'm flawed, let's say. I've certainly been affected by the experience of having kids... trying to be a father, at least. It's an amazing process. It's like songwriting: it's a complete mystery to me. I don't understand it - but I've certainly written about it.": "Loudon",
  "It's always exciting to see different cities I love, and go on tour buses. It's so much fun to travel. My favorite part is being able to perform live in front of all these amazing people; being able to connect with them and seeing their reaction makes me feel very special.": "Jackie",
  "Don't contour with blush - that's so eighties. It was an amazing trend then, but it's not hot now. Instead, go for a neutral contour color that's one or two shades deeper than your skin tone.": "Tyra",
  "I loved 'Gladiator' when I was young. Russell Crowe was a big inspiration the fact that he plays my father in 'Noah' was amazing.": "Douglas",
  "The goal is to really blur the line. Can you perform a magic trick in a way that someone doesn't think it's a magic trick but is something amazing they haven't seen before? Then they have to wrestle with reality.": "Michael",
  "It's amazing how easily people are led to fury and chaos. Unhappy people with guns are not going to make this country great.": "Meryl",
  "I'm in love with lots of different things. I do love love, though. I don't think love should make you feel uneasy. When you feel sick, I don't think that's love - that's infatuation. Someone who makes you feel like that is exciting - it's the one that you imagine when you think of an amazing affair - but that's not actually a stable love.": "Alexa",
  "Oftentimes, it feels like we spend so much of our life waiting to make art, waiting for somebody to let us do something. You don't really have to do that. You can make it all the time. And 99 percent of the time, it's not going to be a big deal on a global scale. But 100 percent of the time, it's going to make you feel amazing.": "Daveed",
  "Your voice is like a very serious instrument that you have to tame if you want to be an amazing singer - Marvin Gaye or Michael Jackson.": "Theophilus",
  "It's amazing to be able to play the sport that I grew up loving so much and that I have a strong passion for. I'm just having a ball. There's a lot of pressure that comes with being in the spotlight and being a superstar and a role model, but I'm enjoying it.": "Reggie",
  "The creative act amazes me. Whether it's poetry, whether it's music, it's an amazing process, and it has something to do with bringing forth the old out into the world to create and to bring forth that which will rejuvenate.": "Joy",
  "Victor Cruz just got his deal with Givenchy - amazing. I was so excited for him. That was amazing. So I think there are great opportunities for a lot of athletes out there.": "Colin",
  "My ideal night would probably be a dope outfit, people that I love around me. Go to get some dinner, have some amazing food. Maybe sushi or Italian: I love both.": "Bebe",
  "It's amazing what ordinary people can do if they set out without preconceived notions.": "Ben",

  "It's amazing how ideas start out, isn't it?": "Nigel",
  "To feel the presence of the Lord is an amazing thing.": "Lisa",
  "At once I feel that comedy is this amazing sort of transcendent thing, and I'm also open to the fact that maybe it's just an evolutionary hiccup, something that upright apes do in their free time.": "Bo",
  "I just think we're living in a time of massive, amazing change, like the Industrial Revolution on acid.": "Kelly",
  "This band has never had an argument. It's just amazing.": "Dave",
  "You can muck around with different guitars for certain bits, but you have to have your own sound. That's your benchmark, that's your sound. I also play a Black Beauty. It sounds amazing.": "Dan",
  "They say it's good but I didn't know what I was doing until I got into the suit and they put the moustache on me, and somehow, when I got all the drag on, it came out. It was the most amazing thing. I'm truly extraordinary.": "Harvey",
  "I've had a very interesting career. I get to do amazing things and work with amazing people and travel and learn languages - things most people don't get the opportunity to do.": "Gwyneth",
  "I was the first spokesperson for the Better Hearing Institute in Washington. And that's the message we tried to send out - there is hearing help out there, and the technology and options are amazing.": "Norm",
  "My best kiss was on stage. Kelly Rowland from Destiny's Child gave me a really nice soft kiss on my lips during a performance on my birthday. It was amazing.": "Chris",
  "Every time I got 'Amazing Spider-Man' or 'Fantastic Four' or another book firmly on the rails, we got pulled into some big event book or crossover and it cost momentum and messed badly with the pacing and structure of the book.": "J.",
  "Some of my fans have said that because I've been able to speak about my issues, that they're not afraid to speak about theirs, which is an amazing feeling.": "Demi",
  "Montana and I had a chemistry that was unbelievable. When I first came into the league he told me I added five years to his career, and I just think we complimented each other very well and were able to do some amazing things out on the football field.": "Jerry",
  "That's an amazing feeling, to walk onstage, and you're not thinking about anything, you're not thinking about your lines or what you're supposed to do - your body, your brain knows, so there's freedom. There's not fear, there's not nerves.": "Eric",
  "When you're a stay-at-home mother you have to pretend it's really boring, but it's not. It's enriching and fulfilling, and an amazing experience. And then when you're a working mother you have to pretend that you feel guilty all day long.": "Amy",
  "I cannot stress enough that the answer to life's questions is often in people's faces. Try putting your iPhones down once in a while, and look in people's faces. People's faces will tell you amazing things. Like if they are angry, or nauseous or asleep.": "Amy",
  "There was once a caustic comment from someone suggesting I was breeding a new race. Fans from different countries have married, amazing things like that. I've been to some of the weddings. I went to one here the other day, a pagan ceremony.": "Terry",
  "I realized the other day that I've lived in New York longer than I've lived anywhere else. It's amazing: I am a New Yorker. It's strange I never thought I would be. ": "David",
  "My mom can't defend herself to the world. She is such an amazing woman, with such an open heart. It's a real hard line, and I crossed it. I took everyone's life story and assumed it would be a great thing to put on screen. I was being selfish and I feel so horrible about it. I feel so guilty.": "Nikki",
  "We've always described our sound as a bit more guitar driven than normal pop music. Kind of Pink in a boy band form. We've heard a few people say that so now we use it. I think Pink is amazing person to be compared to.": "Liam",
  "Nobody has it all, but for me to even come close is amazing.": "Adam",
  "I've always been fascinated with the juxtaposition of technology in music, not only in recording, but in the keyboard. It's amazing the way you can apply technology to an art form.": "Geoff",
  "Our fears are an amazing gift of the imagination... a way of glimpsing what might be the future when there's still time to influence how that future will play out.": "Karen",
  "Brains don't really smell, but what's amazing about the brain is that it's almost like scrambled eggs or soft tofu, almost like a gel. The brain controls so much of what we do, but you could put your finger right through it.": "Ellen",
  "I'm lucky that most of the time I'm on location in amazing places. Most of the time, I don't need holidays, I just stop working.": "Stephanie",
  "I love getting dressed up. Being a pop star is the most brilliant job for that. A lot of girls love shopping, but they might see the most amazing outfit and think, 'When am I going to wear that?', so it's my duty to exploit the fact I do have events I can wear these things to.": "Sophie",
  "The way that people show me love on Twitter? I don't know man. It's amazing.": "T-Pain",
  "My fans are amazing and super loyal.": "Taio",
  "I met Ellie Goulding at the BRITs. She's lovely. I've got a lot of time for her. I gave her congratulations and whatnot and she let me hold her BRIT. That was amazing - once I'd touched one for the first time, I said 'This cannot be the last time I touch a BRIT.'": "Tinie",
  "As far as I'm concerned, Cate Blanchett is a goddess, but she's really down to earth. She's got all those Oscars, she's made all those amazing films and she could spend her whole life doing that, but what does she also do? She gives birth to three boys and creates her own theatre in Sydney.": "Sylvester",
  "I love surfing, rock climbing, cycling - all that stuff. But it's just amazing that I can inspire people with my running. It's humbling, really.": "Dean",
  "I am definitely a Type A personality, always rushing around, trying to do too much, not good at just lying on the beach. But I'm so thankful for everything I have: wonderfully supportive parents and sisters, the best husband in the world, terrific students I love teaching and hanging out with, and above all, my two amazing daughters.": "Amy",
  "If you want to create a great product, just focus on one person. Make that one person have the most amazing experience ever.": "Brian",
  "Being in 'Doctor Who' has been so amazing. I don't think I will ever have a job quite so fun ever again. I feel sad because I am going to leave, but with any story, it has to come to an end.": "Karen",

  "Birds themselves are so interesting and intelligent, and they give so many cues without being verbal, so they say such great things. Feathers are superior to fur, even. They're so beautiful, and nature uses such amazing colors.": "Bibhu",
  "Only amazing designers think of the truly new.": "Patrick",
  "Polo is a great thing to do with your kids and your family - it is a great day out. And to me, horses are amazing creatures that give you this cable to Earth and put you in contact with nature.": "Nacho",
  "I think probably one of the coolest things was when I went to play basketball at Rucker Park in Harlem. First of all, who would think that Larry the Cable Guy would go to Harlem to play basketball? And I was received like a rock star. It was amazing! There were people everywhere. There were guys walking by yelling, 'Git 'r done!'": "Larry",
  "I grew up on classic Nintendo, which was amazing. My best friends were hardcore into it.": "Johanna",
  "I stumbled on a joke idea and style that worked, the audience went with it and, from that moment on, I was hooked. It's an amazing feeling.": "Marcus",
  "Some of my favorite media is the still cartoon that you can sit and study. You can get amazing metaphors across really quickly. I'm in awe of a Charles Schulz.": "Bob",
  "I'm living as an artist, and that's a staggering feeling, it's a total luxury. And because you have this amazing chance, with so much freedom, I'm determined to make something that is worth that. I feel this responsibility - to create something that makes an audience feel, which takes them somewhere. But that's very hard to achieve.": "Conor",
  "I think women of our generation went through Cultural Revolution, went through hardship, coming from nowhere, and suddenly see China's amazing opportunity. So women just seized the opportunity.": "Zhang",
  "I went through the extremes of amazing notoriety and also the dreaded things that you never thought you'd have to live through. Not everything works the way you want it to, but if I sit back and think, 'Am I happy about this?' Yeah. I wouldn't have done anything any better.": "Ralph",
  "I was getting a little bored with my hair. It's kind of a symbolic thing, just getting rid of the past, moving forward. It's amazing what a reaction you get when you cut your hair.": "Pamela",
  "I loved filming in Morocco it was amazing. I'd never been anywhere like that. The culture was phenomenal. I was so blown away by the spirit of that country.": "Tatiana",
  "I was about to meet Beyonce, and I had a full-blown anxiety attack. Then she popped in looking gorgeous, and said, 'You're amazing! When I listen to you I feel like I'm listening to God.'": "Adele",

  "The catering on 'True Blood' was so good - I'd be eating amazing doughnuts all day, then realised I was in danger of turning into a right fat faerie.": "Robert",
  "I've been incredibly fortunate to be able to have different opportunities and be able to choose, which is kind of amazing.": "Steven",
  "When I'm in the city, I like to go to different events and get introduced to different people. That's what New York is all about. There is great diversity, and there are people from all over the world who have done amazing things. That's my favorite thing to do: meet new people.": "Carl",
  "There's nothing nicer than getting a round of applause for turning up for work. It's amazing! You start work, and people clap. Do you know what I mean? And then they stand up and clap at the end.": "James",
  "One of my favorite things about working on 'Glory Daze' is getting to wear amazing '80s outfits coupled with fabulously over-the-top hair and makeup. My wardrobe usually consists of colorful sweaters, denim skirts, high-waisted shorts, crop tops, dangly earrings, jean jackets, and, of course, panty hose and shoulder pads.": "Julianna",
  "Adrenaline is an amazing thing.": "Mitch",
  "Television has changed. There's obviously the generic shows, but on HBO and AMC, there are some really great series, so I'm not closed off to television. If there's an amazing role with amazing people and a great story, I'd definitely be open to it.": "Amanda",
  "Music has always been in my family, but it was mainly keyboards. I learned to play classical piano, but when I first heard the amazing bass guitar of James Jamerson, who played on all the big Motown hits of the '60s and '70s, I knew bass guitar was my instrument.": "Suzi",
  "For such a small country, Britain packs in an amazing diversity of landscapes: coastline, lakes, mountains, rolling countryside, villages and great cities.": "Rory",
  "It's amazing, coconut oil. I use it as a moisturizer. I put it in my hair when I want a kind of greasy look. I take off my makeup with it. I put a little bit in my coffee. I have coconut oil with everything.": "Lykke",
  "If you ever have a kid who doesn't know what to do, stick him in art school. It's amazing what evolves.": "Ridley",
  "My son is wonderful. He is amazing.": "Evangeline",
  "Anything salty and crunch is a world of perfection to me. Put chips in front of me, and I will eat to the bottom of the bag. Because I have the tendency to do this, I found these amazing Eden Brown Rice Chips. They're the perfect amount of salt and crunch, and there's nothing in them.": "Tamara",
  "When a translation is very good, it is fascinating to see how the book changes and yet stays the same. I think 'Out Stealing Horses' sounds more American for Americans than it does in Norway, and still, it is all there, everything that I wrote. It's amazing.": "Per",
  "I've had an incredible life with a lot of triumphs, my share of heartbreak, and some pretty amazing experiences.": "Mike",
  "The thing about this business is that you always end up finding these amazing stories and these amazing people who make amazing films. I just want to work with good people and keep challenging myself with different kinds of characters.": "Madhur",
  "My job is to teach someone something they never knew, but it should not be like you're in a prisoner-of-war camp. I'm supposed to be teaching you but also entertaining you. You're giving me an hour of your time. It should be lively. We're on a hunt, it's a mystery, and it's amazing.": "Bonnie",
  "I seem to be landing a lot of roles with animal interactions, which is amazing.": "Maisie",
  "I can completely lose myself into just absolutely satisfying things - a really amazing cheeseburger, a pizza, good fries, a beer. I enjoy being comfortable and eating whatever the hell I like. It's a big thing for me, just having the freedom to be able to do that.": "Channing",

  "There is such an advantage to self-releasing. If you can do it yourself, it's the best way to go. In Europe and the rest of world outside the U.S., I have licensed my music to labels.

  "We know there are certain chemicals that are designed to give us a rush of pleasure. But, one of the most amazing things about being human is our capacity to override that pleasure.

  "I remembered a long time ago when 'A League of Their Own' came out, and they had the opening sequence with an older Geena Davis. We all just thought it was amazing, but you find out it actually wasn't Geena Davis; it wasn't makeup. It was basically finding an actress that looked like her, and then Geena just dubbed her voice.": "James",

  "I used to do ballet all the time, and I do this ballet workout: it is an amazing thing called Barrecore. It is like pulsing. It turns your legs into, like, jelly, and you feel like a Bambi; you lose so much control over your body because you're pulsing so much.": "Rita",
  "I wouldn't want to do an average fashion line. I'd want it to be an amazing piece of art.": "Rita",
  "I'm not an Adonis, that's for damn sure. I've never really thought of myself that way, and it doesn't matter to me. My favorite actors aren't Adonises. Dustin Hoffman is a flawed-looking man; he's amazing to me. Tom Hanks is flawed-looking; people love him. Same with Gene Hackman.": "Shia",
  "To be able to sit in Donald Trump's apartment and talk about the future of corporate real estate was amazing.": "Shia",

  "I feel like when you have an unauthorized police badge and something that looks like it could be a concealed weapon in the small of your back that when you, someone crosses you, pisses you off, road rage, I think just the slight badge and the little moving away of the jacket and not losing eye contact does amazing things.": "Sandra",

  "I do appreciate the '80s as an era, the general sounds and aesthetics of the era. The Cure, that whole kind of image is really kind of amazing, I think. The power ballads and how everything sparkles and words are really dramatic. Huge drums, things like that. I do really find it inspiring.": "Charli",

  "The people of Disney are so incredibly amazing they are so nice. ": "Ryan",
  "It's amazing to me that Glenn Beck can be on the cover of 'Time,' and there can be a whole article about him basically saying, 'Well, you know, he's controversial.' It's like, 'No, he's a dangerous idiot who needs the help of a good psychiatrist!'": "Viggo",
  "My earliest influence was Quincy Jones. I thought 'The Wiz' soundtrack was the most amazing thing I'd ever heard. It was my first record and you had Michael Jackson, Ted Ross, Nipsey Russell and Diana Ross on it. I even took it to show and tell in third grade!": "Jill",
  "Our minds do understand that people of all races find genuine love in many places. We dig that the world is full of amazing options.": "Jill",
  "I think Freddie Mercury is probably the best of all time in terms of a rock voice.

  "Cotton candy is the most amazing form of caramelization ever invented by man.": "Jose",

  "Being asked to play 'The Doctor' is an amazing privilege. Like the Doctor himself I find myself in a state of utter terror and delight. I can't wait to get started.": "Peter",
  "I'm not terribly well read. My wife forces books into my hands and insists I read them, which I'm grateful to her for. She made me read 'War and Peace.' The whole thing. It was amazing, but I had to hide it. You can't walk round reading 'War and Peace' - it's like you're in a comedy sketch and you think you're smart.": "Peter",
  "I want to be like Tom Cruise from 'The Outsiders' and go on and do amazing movies for a long time.": "Ashton",
  "The last real movie stars were probably Redford and Newman. And things were different then. There wasn't this amazing amount of magazines and information about them.": "George",
  "Acting is something I appreciate, and I think it's been an amazing experience. But I'm not passionate about acting the way you probably should be to call yourself an actor.": "Evangeline",
  "It would be amazing to play Sylvia Plath. She was so dark, and what came out of her writing was troubled and fierce. The dimensions, levels, layers and levels would be incredible to take on.": "Evangeline",

  "One of the many characteristics of the new is that, at first, it's very hard to recognize it for what it is. We're lucky if we recognize something as being new when it first appears. Usually I think we don't have that privilege. It's usually after the fact that we suddenly turn around and say, 'Wow, this thing is amazing.'": "Junot",
  "It's important to show that there's different ways of doing things. Some people like to be glamorous, and that's perfectly fine, and that's amazing. If I were that style, then I would do that. I'd wear heels every day, and I'd strut around in a dress, but that's not me.": "Alessia",

  "Man is such an amazing animal, and the possibilities are infinite for each person.": "Stellan",

  "Mankind, his brain has embraced so many amazing things, and yet we're still beating each other over the heads with clubs, excepting the bullets now, one bullet can wipe out an entire city.": "Martin",
  "I see hip-hop as going in a self-managing place. It's very culturally controlled and artist-controlled. It's not really based on a label anymore. Everything is pretty much in the control of the artist. Which is amazing.": "Travis",
  "When the youth of America gets together, amazing things happen.": "Tom",
  "Some of the most amazing people I've met in life are cops.": "Omari",
  "Men have the power in everything: journalism, acting, direction; in banks, finances, schools. All the laws are made by men. Men think that women, when they're not able to procreate any more, become old. That is not true - they are still amazing!": "Monica",
  "I went to an all-girls school for part of high school, and the idea of boys was amazing to me; like, all I ever wanted to do was kiss boys and be around boys.": "Alexandra",
  "A little bit of sun does wonders! With good protection, of course. Vitamin D is just so good for your hair and your nails. I also love coconut water and coconut oil from Whole Foods. It's amazing.

  "I have been on dialysis in Istanbul, Milan, Indonesia, Manila, London. It's - it's amazing.": "Natalie",

  "Most of us pass our lives never once laying eyes on our own organs, the most precious and amazing things we own. Until something goes wrong, we barely give them thought. This seems strange to me. How is it that we find Christina Aguilera more interesting than the inside of our own bodies?": "Mary",

  "I went from living in the Dominican Republic - every day, my mom and I would cook, or we'd go hang out with the kids - to flying a private jet to Chicago with Zac Efron and Dennis Quaid. People had champagne, and they were going to these amazing restaurants. It was a culture shock. It's important, I think, to have that. To see both sides.": "Maika",
  "I think people would like to see Kurt Angle and myself get in there and perform with one another. I think he's an amazing athlete, a talented wrestler, and it's a match people probably don't think that they're going to see.": "Shawn",
  "I know nothing at all about women. They are an amazing, beautiful mystery.": "Peter",
  "I don't want people to see me fall. I mean, I got enough people cheering for me to fall now... The Internet has created some amazing place for evil to exist, you dig?": "Steve",
  "My fans and followers are so amazing.": "Kylie",
  "I think it works differently for everyone. Some people do amazing things with research, but for me, it just gets convoluted, and I start to think too much.": "Dove",
  "I wasn't ready for fame and all that brings to your life. It was an amazing experience, but so overwhelming, because no one can tell you beforehand when it will happen or how it will impact you. So no one can tell you how to handle it, being stopped everywhere you go because people saw you on 'Oprah.' It took me over, and I wasn't ready.": "Iyanla",
  "I think the fact that I made enough noise in the world that I might be remembered is an amazing achievement. You can't ask for more than that.": "Nas",
  "When I turned 25, something changed in me. I see children in my future 100%. Soon. I started thinking I want my kids to look back and say, 'Wasn't Mummy amazing?' I've really started thinking about what I'm leaving for them.": "Jessie",
  "But I am not going to live for ever. And the more I know it, the more amazed I am by being here at all.": "William",
  "Food brings back memories. I had a mom that wasn't a good cook, so I would eat my grandma's food. It was amazing because it brings back a time almost in Technicolor. I see her house, I see her stove; I think about what it felt like when I was sick, and it felt like love.": "Debi",
  "I went to a fundamentalist Christian high school and went to a fundamentalist church, and they were the greatest people; there was an amazing sense of community.

  "Music has always been such an amazing tool for me to access self and emotion.": "Matisyahu",
  "I find that the most special thing to me is if you've connected to people in some way: If someone comes up to you on the street and says something to you, and you know it's meant something to them, and it's connected to some project. That, I find, is amazing.": "Tim",
  "If people think you are this amazing, own it.": "David",

About a month after we started dating, he bought me this amazing black-and-white photo book on the circus in the 1930s, and I started sobbing.": "Christina",
  "Israel's creation was politically amazing and caused by a number of unusual events. And I understand. For centuries, Jews endured horrible suffering, and like other people, deserve the right to self-determination, but the way Israel is going now frightens me. Jews make awkward colonial overlords.": "Harvey",
  "When you are a kid, a wolf is an amazing sight, so sumptuous. I sort of knew these were splendid creatures, that I was not going to find them outside roaming around. It was like a dog, but not a dog. It was incredible, a god!": "Sarah",

  "I love Carrie Fisher, and it would be amazing to carry on her legacy.": "Millie",
  "People say: 'Oh, but would you be happy for your show to go on BBC3 if it was just online?' If I was sat here telling you I had just signed a huge deal with Netflix you'd be going: 'Wow, that's amazing.' You can't see it as 'Oh, it's no longer a channel because it's not on TV.'": "James",
  "This arrogance thing... I've had that my whole life. I flip between, 'Oh really? Oh, thank you. Wow. That's amazing' and, 'Yeah! Of course I am.' They're both varying degrees of a self-defence mechanism. It can be from minute to minute that I change.": "James",
  "Every now and then, I have blissful moments of thanking God for all the amazing things that are happening.

  "I think Alison Krauss is one of the most amazing singers ever. As a songwriter - this is gonna sound cheesy - I love Randy Newman. And my mom passed on a love of Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. At one point I was so into the Indigo Girls, just like I was so into the Dixie Chicks, those female harmonies.": "Cam",
  "You would be amazed what the ordinary guy knows.": "Matt",

  "Giving birth was the most amazing thing I've ever done. I'd been living in a Third World country, and I said, 'I'm going to just squat behind a tree.'

  "It's amazing how a competitive nature can turn a negative into something positive.": "Barry",
  "There were two things going on: 1) I had already established in my own mind where I wanted to go with the next series, and having James around as a Grey Eminence would have complicated matters. He had had an amazing life and it was time to bid him good-bye.": "Raymond",

  "In the past few years, we've been doing amazing stuff with desserts. Pastry chefs have been using herbs and spices in their desserts.

  "Dogs are a really amazing eye opener for us humans because their lives are compressed into such a short period, so we can see them go from puppyhood to adolescence to strong adulthood and then into their sunset years in 10 to 12 years. It really drives home the point of how finite all our lives are.": "John",

  "I travel to a lot of schools, and I see firsthand that while we do still have a lot of traditional readers, we don't have as many as we used to. And we're missing an awful lot of kids entirely...

  "It's amazing when you're playing to a crowd who barely understands English but they're singing parts of your song back to you.": "Jason",

  "I never thought I would become amazing. I never thought I would be as great as my father.

  "I was really attracted to doing 'Game of Thrones' because I thought the character of Meera was absolutely amazing.": "Ellie",

  "You surround yourself with amazing, grade-A talent, and you're going to have to lift your game. You kind of thrive just by being around such people.": "Joe",
  "There are two sorts of curiosity - the momentary and the permanent. The momentary is concerned with the odd appearance on the surface of things. The permanent is attracted by the amazing and consecutive life that flows on beneath the surface of things.": "Robert",
  "Honestly, I'd love to say I live this amazing Hollywood lifestyle, but actually, I'm at home with my same friends and cooking. I crochet, I do watercolor. I think what surprised me the most is that that isn't the lifestyle everyone necessarily lives.": "Yael",
  "It's amazing the hours you pull when you're the lead of a show.": "Jamie",
  "The facilities are amazing here in McLaren. If you compare them to Sauber, who have good facilities in Formula 1, it's another level. But in terms of the people, the way they approach their jobs, is really amazing when you come into McLaren. The emphasis they have is very good and it gives you a big boost when you drive for this team.": "Sergio",

  "It is amazing how nice people are to you when they know you're going away.": "Michael",
  "With 'A Northern Light,' I've already heard from teenage readers, teachers, librarians - it's been so gratifying. It's amazing that you can take something that matters so deeply to you and make it matter to someone else.": "Jennifer",
  "It's amazing how much of a bodily experience being scared is. It doesn't take very long of hyperventilating to feel like you're going to pass out. It's one of those things where being scared is more of a physiological response that you can pretty easily manipulate. So in those types of scenes, it just takes a lot of energy.": "Willa",

  "Passion is energy. Feel the power that comes from focusing on what excites you.": "Oprah",

  "Democracy must be built through open societies that share information. When there is information, there is enlightenment. When there is debate, there are solutions. When there is no sharing of power, no rule of law, no accountability, there is abuse, corruption, subjugation and indignation.": "Atifete",

  "I write about the power of trying, because I want to be okay with failing. I write about generosity because I battle selfishness. I write about joy because I know sorrow. I write about faith because I almost lost mine, and I know what it is to be broken and in need of redemption. I write about gratitude because I am thankful - for all of it.": "Kristin",

  "No power on earth has a right to take our property from us without our consent.": "John",
  "No man can be judged a criminal until he is found guilty; nor can society take from him the public protection until it has been proved that he has violated the conditions on which it was granted.

  "The ultimate value of life depends upon awareness and the power of contemplation rather than upon mere survival.": "Aristotle",

  "We need money. We need hits. Hits bring money, money bring power, power bring fame, fame change the game.": "Young",

  "The power of community to create health is far greater than any physician, clinic or hospital.": "Mark",

  "Our country is now taking so steady a course as to show by what road it will pass to destruction, to wit: by consolidation of power first, and then corruption, its necessary consequence.": "Thomas",
  "Thanks to Hillary Clinton, Iran is now the dominant Islamic power in the Middle East, and on the road to nuclear weapons. Hillary Clinton's support for violent regime change in Syria has thrown the country into one of the bloodiest civil wars anyone has ever seen - while giving ISIS a launching pad for terrorism against the West.": "Donald",
  "Revolution is about the need to re-evolve political, economic and social justice and power back into the hands of the people, preferably through legislation and policies that make human sense. That's what revolution is about. Revolution is not about shootouts.": "Bobby",

  "If small things have the power to disturb you, then who you think you are is exactly that: small.": "Eckhart",
  "The one characteristic of authentic power that most people overlook is humbleness. It is important for many reasons. A humble person walks in a friendly world.

  "The greater the power, the more dangerous the abuse.": "Edmund",

  "Never give up, which is the lesson I learned from boxing. As soon as you learn to never give up, you have to learn the power and wisdom of unconditional surrender, and that one doesn't cancel out the other; they just exist as contradictions. The wisdom of it comes as you get older.": "Kris",
  "If women be educated for dependence; that is, to act according to the will of another fallible being, and submit, right or wrong, to power, where are we to stop?": "Mary",
  "Nuclear power is a young technology - there's so much more to be discovered. That's what makes it so exciting to me. Yes, there are problems, but innovative people are going to be able to come up with solutions and bring the technology to its full potential.": "Leslie",
  "Balk the enemy's power force him to reveal himself. ": "Sun",
  "The real power of the Buddha was that he had so much love.

  "Power tends to corrupt, and absolute power corrupts absolutely.": "John",
  "Owning a great golf course gives you great power.": "Donald",

  "When Whitney Houston died, I felt great sadness.

  "Grown-ups and children are not readily encouraged to unearth the power of words.

  "Our grandkids will lead the lives of the gods of mythology. Zeus could think and move objects around. We'll have that power. Venus had a perfect, timeless body. We'll have that, too. Pegasus was a flying horse. We'll be able to modify life in the future.": "Michio",
  "The greater the power, the more need there is for transparency, because if the power is abused, the result can be so enormous. On the other hand, those people who do not have power, we mustn't reduce their power even more by making them yet more transparent.": "Julian",
  "It was very lucky for me as a writer that I studied the physical sciences rather than English. I wrote for my own amusement.

  "The greatest obstacle to the welfare state is not greed but private charity that makes the welfare state irrelevant; the greatest obstacle to re-education of children in the name of the collective is allegiance to a higher power.

  "The apostle enters upon his subject thus - Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers; for there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.": "Jonathan",

  "I believe in the healing power of the arts, and whenever anyone can bring art into anyone's life, it's a special thing.": "Austin",
  "It's not as though we can keep burning coal in our power plants. Coal is a finite resource, too.
