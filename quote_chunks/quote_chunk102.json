  "If anyone asks you what kind of music you play, tell him 'pop.' Don't tell him 'rock'n'roll' or they won't even let you in the hotel.": "Buddy",
  "I spend a lot of time copying saxophone players and trumpet players. Not to say that it is not important to listen to guitar players, but there's so much music out there and so many possibilities. I like anyone who plays any instrument.": "Bill",

  "If our music survives, which I have no doubt it will, then it will because it is good.": "Jerry",
  "I never presumed that a technique of composition or an idea was so special that just using it would guarantee the quality of the music.": "Robert",
  "Music is an art that expresses the inexpressible. It rises far above what words can mean or the intelligence define. Its domain is the imponderable and impalpable land of the unconscious.": "Charles",
  "Emphasis on the common emotive or affective origins of music and words in the first cries of humankind undermines words.": "Jean",
  "Music is at once the product of feeling and knowledge, for it requires from its disciples, composers and performers alike, not only talent and enthusiasm, but also that knowledge and perception which are the result of protracted study and reflection.": "Alban",

  "Age is something that doesn't matter, unless you are a cheese.": "Luis",
  "Try to keep your soul young and quivering right up to old age.": "George",
  "Our uniqueness makes us special, makes perception valuable - but it can also make us lonely. This loneliness is different from being 'alone': You can be lonely even surrounded by people. The feeling I'm talking about stems from the sense that we can never fully share the truth of who we are. I experienced this acutely at an early age.": "Amy",
  "Being confident is the key to life. Don't be afraid to be you! I'm super different from a lot of kids my age with style and personality, and I'm OK with it. And if you are OK with it, everyone else will be, too. Just be yourself.": "Leo",
  "In our age there is no such thing as 'keeping out of politics.' All issues are political issues, and politics itself is a mass of lies, evasions, folly, hatred and schizophrenia.": "George",
  "Age is an issue of mind over matter. If you don't mind, it doesn't matter.": "Mark",

  "In age of consumerism and materialism, I traffic in blue sky and colored air.": "James",
  "People gossip. People are insecure, so they talk about other people so that they won't be talked about. They point out flaws in other people to make them feel good about themselves. I think at any age or any social class, that's present.": "Blake",

  "My love for ice cream emerged at an early age - and has never left!": "Ginger",
  "I strive for perfection, but I'm not perfect. But what I can say is my morals are totally different than any other 24-year-old rapper my age now. I look at life totally different. A whole other aspect. I have different views and morals on life in general. And opinions.": "ASAP",

  "In youth we learn in age we understand. ": "Marie",
  "Probably the happiest period in life most frequently is in middle age, when the eager passions of youth are cooled, and the infirmities of age not yet begun; as we see that the shadows, which are at morning and evening so large, almost entirely disappear at midday.": "Eleanor",

  "Hesitation increases in relation to risk in equal proportion to age.": "Ernest",
  "In an age where everything and everyone is linked through networks of glass and air, no one - no business, organization, government agency, country - is an island. We need to do right by all our stakeholders, and that's how you create value for shareholders. And one thing is for sure - no organization can succeed in a world that is failing.": "Don",
  "I'm glad I was born when I was. My time was the golden age of variety. If I were starting out again now, maybe things would happen for me, but it certainly would not be on a variety show with 28 musicians, 12 dancers, two major guest stars, 50 costumes a week by Bob Mackie.

  "My mother is Turtle Mountain Chippewa, and she lived on her home reservation. My father taught there. He had just been discharged from the Air Force. He went to school on the GI Bill and got his teaching credentials. He is adventurous - he worked his way through Alaska at age seventeen and paid for his living expenses by winning at the poker table.": "Louise",
  "We live in an age where there is a firehose of information, and there is no hierarchy of what is important and what is not. Where the truth is often fashioned through a variety of digital means.

  "Education is the best provision for old age.": "Aristotle",
  "Be eccentric now. Don't wait for old age to wear purple.": "Regina",

  "A comfortable old age is the reward of a well-spent youth. Instead of its bringing sad and melancholy prospects of decay, it would give us hopes of eternal youth in a better world.": "Maurice",

  "If you haven't turned rebel by twenty you've got no heart if you haven't turned establishment by thirty you've got no brains! ": "Kevin",
  "The finest lesson I've learned with age is that all I need is a small team of comrades who inspire me, try not to judge me, and remind me when I'm judging myself.": "Lake",

  "Like a lot of kids, I had a Superman cake or different theme cakes, but then I hit the age where I think my mom thought I was ready for the German chocolate cake that she makes for my dad. Just the sight of that, the taste of that frosting, just reminds me of being at home with my mom and my dad and my sister and my friends.": "Willie",
  "In every age 'the good old days' were a myth. No one ever thought they were good at the time. For every age has consisted of crises that seemed intolerable to the people who lived through them.": "Brooks",

  "People say women shouldn't have long hair over a certain age, but I've never done what everyone says.": "Jane",

  "It is true that going out on to the street implies the risk of accidents happening, as they would to any ordinary man or woman. But if the church stays wrapped up in itself, it will age.

  "Youth is the best time to be rich, and the best time to be poor.": "Euripides",
  "At the age of 18, I made up my mind to never have another bad day in my life. I dove into a endless sea of gratitude from which I've never emerged.": "Patch",
  "Looking back, I realise I had to grow up and be responsible at a very tender age.": "Andie",

  "At my age flowers scare me.": "George",
  "My justification is that most people my age spend a lot of time thinking about what they're going to do for the next five or ten years. The time they spend thinking about their life, I just spend drinking.": "Amy",
  "It is not the young people that degenerate they are not spoiled till those of mature age are already sunk into corruption. ": "Charles",

  "The golden age is before us, not behind us.": "Simon",
  "In the information age, you don't teach philosophy as they did after feudalism. You perform it. If Aristotle were alive today he'd have a talk show.": "Timothy",
  "Utility is the great idol of the age, to which all powers must do service and all talents swear allegiance.": "Friedrich",
  "As time goes by and you're getting older and stuff like that - getting older sucks. You know, I hear all this crap about, 'Oh, you can age with dignity.' Really?": "Mickey",
  "We aren't in an information age, we are in an entertainment age.": "Tony",
  "Youth is the spirit of adventure and awakening. It is a time of physical emerging when the body attains the vigor and good health that may ignore the caution of temperance. Youth is a period of timelessness when the horizons of age seem too distant to be noticed.": "Ezra",
  "Just as we reject racism, sexism, ageism, and heterosexism, we reject speciesism. The species of a sentient being is no more reason to deny the protection of this basic right than race, sex, age, or sexual orientation is a reason to deny membership in the human moral community to other humans.": "Gary",
  "Old age has its pleasures, which, though different, are not less than the pleasures of youth.": "W.",
  "If you age with somebody, you go through so many roles - you're lovers, friends, enemies, colleagues, strangers; you're brother and sister. That's what intimacy is, if you're with your soulmate.": "Cate",
  "Privacy is one of the biggest problems in this new electronic age.": "Andy",
  "Age is relative. Experience is relative. And I think often intensity is confused with maturity.": "Laura",
  "My father... removed from Kentucky to... Indiana, in my eighth year... It was a wild region, with many bears and other wild animals still in the woods. There I grew up... Of course when I came of age, I did not know much. Still somehow, I could read, write, and cipher... but that was all.": "Abraham",
  "There's something unique about the United States, a sense of individual rights and freedoms, and a sense of social and civic responsibility that we contributed to so much of the world. We lost that mission in the 1980s and 1990s, when we entered a gilded age, and the culture of individualism became a culture of avarice.": "George",
  "A woman has the age she deserves.": "Coco",
  "When we looked at the life cycle in our 40s, we looked to old people for wisdom. At 80, though, we look at other 80-year-olds to see who got wise and who not. Lots of old people don't get wise, but you don't get wise unless you age.": "Erik",
  "Scripture is filled with examples of men and women whom God used late in life, often with great impact - men and women who refused to use old age as an excuse to ignore what God wanted them to do.": "Billy",
  "To keep the heart unwrinkled, to be hopeful, kindly, cheerful, reverent that is to triumph over old age.": "Amos",
  "Retirement at sixty-five is ridiculous. When I was sixty-five I still had pimples.": "George",
  "Irrespective of age, we mourn for those loved and lost. Mourning is one of the deepest expressions of pure love.": "Russell",
  "It is surprising to notice that even from the earliest age, man finds the greatest satisfaction in feeling independent. The exalting feeling of being sufficient to oneself comes as a revelation.": "Maria",
  "I had assumed that I would age with all my friends growing old around me, dying off very gradually one by one. And here was a plague that cut them off so early.": "Thom",
  "By the proper intakes of vitamins and other nutrients and by following a few other healthful practices from youth or middle age on, you can, I believe, extend your life and years of well-being by twenty-five or even thirty-five years.": "Linus",
  "I don't think of myself as a poor deprived ghetto girl who made good. I think of myself as somebody who from an early age knew I was responsible for myself, and I had to make good.": "Oprah",

  "To resist the frigidity of old age, one must combine the body, the mind, and the heart. And to keep these in parallel vigor one must exercise, study, and love.": "Alan",
  "Though the Jazz Age continued it became less and less an affair of youth. The sequel was like a children's party taken over by the elders.": "F.",
  "I had just been promoted to the first rugby team. It was a perfect, wonderful coming of age. My brother was already in the team, and my father had come to watch us. We went home, and my father died in front of me. Horribly, in about half an hour. He had a heart attack.": "Anthony",
  "Old age is the most unexpected of all things that happen to a man.": "Leon",

  "The secret of staying young is to live honestly, eat slowly, and lie about your age.": "Lucille",
  "Better pass boldly into that other world, in the full glory of some passion, than fade and wither dismally with age.": "James",
  "I think it's nice to age gracefully. OK, you lose the youth, a certain stamina and dewy glow, but what you gain on the inside as a human being is wonderful: the wisdom, the acceptance and the peace of mind. It's a fair exchange.": "Cherie",
  "New needs need new techniques. And the modern artists have found new ways and new means of making their statements... the modern painter cannot express this age, the airplane, the atom bomb, the radio, in the old forms of the Renaissance or of any other past culture.": "Jackson",
  "I have always felt that a woman has the right to treat the subject of her age with ambiguity until, perhaps, she passes into the realm of over ninety. Then it is better she be candid with herself and with the world.": "Carl",
  "Discrimination due to age is one of the great tragedies of modern life. The desire to work and be useful is what makes life worth living, and to be told your efforts are not needed because you are the wrong age is a crime.": "Johnny",
  "You can fake your age or mask it, but the passion that moves the characters has to be real.": "Victoria",
  "Living life at a young age is like being a sponge thrust into the ocean. You absorb what's around you. If you're around people who are supportive and positive, that's how you look at the world.": "Freddie",
  "Alas, after a certain age every man is responsible for his face.": "Albert",
  "The great secret that all old people share is that you really haven't changed in seventy or eighty years. Your body changes, but you don't change at all. And that, of course, causes great confusion.": "Doris",
  "Old age is like a plane flying through a storm. Once you're aboard, there's nothing you can do.": "Golda",

  "In youth, the days are short and the years are long. In old age, the years are short and days long.": "Pope",
  "Nobody grows old merely by living a number of years. We grow old by deserting our ideals. Years may wrinkle the skin, but to give up enthusiasm wrinkles the soul.": "Samuel",
  "Jobs are a centuries-old concept created during the Industrial Revolution. Despite the reality that we're now deep in the Information Age, many people are studying for, or working at, or clinging to the Industrial Age idea of a safe, secure job.": "Robert",
  "Age is inevitable. Aging isn't.": "Marv",
  "Cancer cells are fixed at an age where they are still too young to have learned the rules of the society in which they live.

  "Age is no barrier. It's a limitation you put on your mind.": "Jackie",
  "The harvest of old age is the recollection and abundance of blessing previously secured.": "Marcus",
  "I'm at the age where food has taken the place of sex in my life. In fact, I've just had a mirror put over my kitchen table.": "Rodney",
  "Not just in commerce but in the world of ideas too our age is putting on a veritable clearance sale. Everything can be had so dirt cheap that one begins to wonder whether in the end anyone will want to make a bid.": "Soren",
  "Exposure from a young age to the realities of the world is a super-big thing.": "Bill",
  "We are all shaped by where we grow up, though that shaping takes different forms. I don't think there's any doubt that coming of age in Winnipeg both opened my eyes and made me hungry - if I can subvert all claims to be a real writer by mixing metaphors like that.": "Guy",
  "If you get to my age in life and nobody thinks well of you, I don't care how big your bank account is, your life is a disaster.": "Warren",

  "Each age has deemed the new-born year the fittest time for festal cheer.": "Walter",
  "The biggest disease this day and age is that of people feeling unloved.": "Princess",
  "Every age yearns for a more beautiful world. The deeper the desperation and the depression about the confusing present, the more intense that yearning.": "Johan",
  "Children who reach the age of eighteen with their entire skills set composed on Nintendo and eating Doritos have been neglected. Their parents neglected to give them the character traits necessary to live successfully.": "Dave",
  "People have to understand one thing: at the age of 18, I arrived at a dream club like Manchester United. It was a dream come true. But, even at that moment, I was thinking about playing in England for some years and then going to play in Spain. Even at that time I was thinking that way, and I always gave 100% everything.": "Cristiano",
  "There's a lot of women out there, some of whom are my age who've never been married and some who have been married and would like to be married again but think their ship has sailed, and I'm like, 'Oh no, honey, let Miss Niecy show you it is never too late for love!'": "Niecy",
  "People don't understand being a child star is very hard because first off, to be a child star, you have to be very unique. These kids are talented to be able to do it at such a young age. At the same time, you go through the pressures of bullying and a lot of people not understanding.": "Romeo",
  "At an early age, my mother gave me this feeling that anything is possible, and I believe that.": "Howard",
  "At some point in every person's life, you will need an assisted medical device - whether it's your glasses, your contacts, or as you age and you have a hip replacement or a knee replacement or a pacemaker. The prosthetic generation is all around us.": "Aimee",
  "We live in an age when the traditional great subjects - the human form, the landscape, even newer traditions such as abstract expressionism - are daily devalued by commercial art.": "Andy",
  "For me at age 11, I had a pair of binoculars and looked up to the moon, and the moon wasn't just bigger, it was better. There were mountains and valleys and craters and shadows. And it came alive.": "Neil",
  "One of the things you learn in football is that you're only as good as your last outing. I don't like to reflect on what we've done in the past. I'm not a very good storyteller, for one thing. I'd disappoint you. When it's time, I'll talk about the good old days. But it's a sign of old age, reveling in the past.": "Chuck",
  "The thing I love most about my job is watching people age backward, becoming more lively and energetic as they free themselves from situations that are toxic to their essential selves.": "Martha",
  "Maybe women get to a certain age and they no longer have a filter they're considered crazy people or something. ": "Michaela",
  "We're in the age of the series, trilogy, boxed sets.": "Glen",
  "I knew that I was loved. And that's such an important thing. And, of course, at such an early age, you take it for granted. Of course your parents love you. Of course Mrs. Hubert across the street loves you and your godmother loves you and your grandparents love you.": "Jessye",
  "Who would want a face that hasn't seen or lived properly, hasn't got any wrinkles that come with age, experience and laughter? Not me, anyway.": "Cate",
  "If repression has indeed been the fundamental link between power, knowledge, and sexuality since the classical age, it stands to reason that we will not be able to free ourselves from it except at a considerable cost.": "Michel",
  "Every work of art is the child of its age and, in many cases, the mother of our emotions. It follows that each period of culture produces an art of its own which can never be repeated.": "Wassily",
  "Anything you cannot relinquish when it has outlived its usefulness possesses you, and in this materialistic age a great many of us are possessed by our possessions.": "Peace",
  "Basically, when I went to school in Sri Lanka from age five onward, the classes there were sometimes sorted into a hierarchy of your skin tone. So the fairer-skinned kids sat at the front row, and the darker-skinned kids sat at the back by the poor ones who played out in the street all day long.": "M.I.A.",
  "What I believe about the young age of the earth comes out of taking the Bible as written. And I've said numerous times over the years that the age of the earth, for example, is not a salvation issue but an authority issue.": "Ken",

  "I think the thing I miss most in our age is our manners. It sounds so old-fashioned in a way. But even bad people had good manners in the old days, and manners hold a community together, and manners hold a family together; in a way, they hold the world together.": "Nancy",
  "I think the biggest disease the world suffers from in this day and age is the disease of people feeling unloved. I know that I can give love for a minute, for half an hour, for a day, for a month, but I can give. I am very happy to do that, I want to do that.": "Princess",
  "Let no one be slow to seek wisdom when he is young nor weary in the search of it when he has grown old. For no age is too early or too late for the health of the soul.": "Epicurus",
  "As technology advances, it reverses the characteristics of every situation again and again. The age of automation is going to be the age of 'do it yourself.'": "Marshall",
  "I've always been intrigued by color and by interesting hair. I was one of those weird little girls doing my own hair at the age of 9. I was, like, getting weird gels and new brushes and cornrow holders. I would tweak and perm at the age of 13.": "Nicki",
  "Being healthy is something I learned from a very young age. Looking after yourself on the inside helps with your energy, makes your skin glow, and changes your whole outlook on life.": "Phoebe",
  "Basically, when you get to my age, you'll really measure your success in life by how many of the people you want to have love you actually do love you.": "Warren",
  "The nicest thing about coming of age is that I can do whatever I like.": "Cilla",
  "Middle age is when your old classmates are so grey and wrinkled and bald they don't recognize you.": "Bennett",
  "Most fears are basic: fear of the dark, fear of going down in the basement, fear of weird sounds, fear that somebody is waiting for you in your closet. Those kinds of things stay with you no matter what age.": "R.",
  "With age comes common sense and wisdom.": "Nas",
  "Too many U.S. adults have a heart age years older than their real age, increasing their risk of heart disease and stroke. Everybody deserves to be young - or at least not old - at heart.": "Tom",
  "It seems this is an age of clever critics who keep bewailing the fact that there are no works worthy of criticism.": "Sylvia",
  "Confusion of goals and perfection of means seems, in my opinion, to characterize our age.": "Albert",
  "Of middle age the best that can be said is that a middle-aged person has likely learned how to have a little fun in spite of his troubles.": "Don",
  "I have had so many great moments, but I would have to say that dancing the Swan in 'Swan Lake' was such a unique and passionate experience for me. It was such bloody hard work, even at that very early age, that I would not want to try to replicate it again now.": "William",

  "When I started go-karting at the age of six, I always dreamt of becoming a Formula One driver.": "Heikki",
  "What's interesting about the shift from an industrial age to a technological age is that we keep inventing new media: movies, records, radio, television, the Internet, and now ebooks - and one of the things that's most interesting about the invention of a new medium is watching it reinvent itself as it penetrates the culture.": "David",
  "I've always been drawn to the Edwardian period in England. To me, it seems like such a fascinating time, when the British Empire was at the height of its powers and the strict mores of the Victorian age were dissipating into the decadence of King Edward's reign.": "Kevin",
  "After 3 years, I left the army at the ripe old age of 20, but I'd like to think some of the skills are still with me. I'm great at physical movement; I can still remember Morse code, and perhaps most importantly, I can fold my socks up into little balls with smiley faces.": "Rhys",
  "Eighteenth-century doctors prescribed sugar pills for nearly everything: heart problems, headache, consumption, labor pains, insanity, old age, and blindness. Hence, the French expression 'like an apothecary without sugar' meant someone in an utterly hopeless situation.": "Tom",

  "The age of chivalry is past. Bores have succeeded to dragons.": "Charles",
  "Age puzzles me. I thought it was a quiet time. My seventies were interesting and fairly serene, but my eighties are passionate. I grow more intense as I age.": "Florida",

  "To teach how to live without certainty and yet without being paralysed by hesitation is perhaps the chief thing that philosophy, in our age, can do for those who study it.": "Bertrand",

  "Every age has a keyhole to which its eye is pasted.": "Mary",

  "Thomas Jefferson once said, 'We should never judge a president by his age, only by his works.' And ever since he told me that, I stopped worrying.": "Ronald",

  "In every age there has been a stream of popular opinion that has carried all before it, and given a family character, as it were, to the century.": "Mary",
  "I saw no African people in the printed and illustrated Sunday school lessons. I began to suspect at this early age that someone had distorted the image of my people. My long search for the true history of African people the world over began.": "John",
  "It's trite to say that the world has gotten smaller in the age of globalization, but my travels have told me that it's wrong to think this means there is some kind of uniform world culture.": "Norman",

  "In this electronic age we see ourselves being translated more and more into the form of information, moving toward the technological extension of consciousness.": "Marshall",
  "Age is not measured by years. Nature does not equally distribute energy. Some people are born old and tired while others are going strong at seventy.": "Dorothy",
  "I'm very accepting with my age. It's like notches on your belt: experience, wisdom, and a different kind of beauty. There comes a day when you've become comfortable in your skin.": "Zoe",
  "Losing both parents at a young age gave me a sense that you can't really control life - so you'd better live it while it's here. I stopped believing in a storybook existence a long time ago. All you can do is push in a direction and see what comes of it.": "Jon",
  "Canada has a passive-aggressive culture, with a lot of sarcasm and righteousness. That went with my weird messianic complex. The ego is a fascinating monster. I was taught from a young age that I had to serve, so that turned into me thinking I had to save the planet.": "Alanis",
  "It's the age of information and we need to just get as informed as we can about what other things might help us live healthy lives.": "Linda",
  "My dad just imprinted in my mind from a very young age that you always do what you say you're gonna do when you say you're gonna do it.": "Bob",
  "From an early age I didn't buy into the value systems of working hard in a nine-to-five job. I thought creativity, friendship and loyalty and pushing the boundaries of what was acceptable was much more interesting.": "Adam",
  "At an early age, I started my own paper route. Once I saw how you could service people and do a good job and get paid for it, I just wanted to be the best I could be in whatever I did.": "Sean",
  "I am happy being able to play roles with people my age because once you do something really mature there is no turning back.": "Lindsay",
  "It's really amazing that in the age of unbelief, as a smart man called it, there isn't even more fraud. After all, with no God, there's no one to ever call you to account, and no accounting at all if you can get away with it.": "Ben",
  "It's sad, actually, because my anxiety keeps me from enjoying things as much as I should at this age.": "Amanda",
  "I feel the 21st century is another new age. Not only can we collaborate again with nature, but we have to. It's an emergency.": "Bjork",
  "With age, you see people fail more. You see yourself fail more. How do you keep that fearlessness of a kid? You keep going. Luckily, I'm not afraid to make a fool of myself.": "Hugh",
  "For the moment I prefer to be a beautiful woman of my age than try desperately to look 30.": "Demi",
  "When at a young age you learn to face your fears, that makes the difference between people being champions and people not being champions.": "Evander",
  "Me personally, I want to entertain people above all. When you look back at burlesque in history and the real golden age of burlesque, those entertainers were there to entertain, and there wasn't usually some big political message behind what they were doing.": "Dita",
  "It's rough being a teenager in this day and age.": "Kay",
  "I used to help my grandfather on the farm, driving tractors, raising crops and animals. I used to feed some of the baby cows and pigs, and I had to be no older than 7 or 8. Then at about 9 or 10 I started driving tractors. It showed me at an early age what hard work was all about and how dedicated you have to be, no matter what you do.": "Tyson",
  "My children were taught at an early age how money works and that it comes from hard work. They've been on a commission - not an allowance - since they were little. They learned that if they worked around the house, they got paid. If they didn't work, they didn't get paid.": "Dave",
  "My father was a newspaper editor, so I was surrounded by journalists my entire life. I think the fact that he was so well known may be why I chose to go into magazines and move to the States at a young age.": "Anna",
  "Even at age 10, I already knew that I was different from most people. My anxiety disorder was still years from being diagnosed, but it affected me quite deeply. I was too afraid to speak out in class, too nervous to make real friends.": "Jenny",
  "I am becoming more radical with age. I have noticed that writers, when they are old, become milder. But for me it is the opposite. Age makes me more angry.": "Nawal",
  "You know, from age 17 on, my paycheck was coming from cooking and working in kitchens.": "Anthony",
  "If anyone thinks they'd rather be in a different part of history, they're probably not a very good student of history. Life sucked in the old days. People knew very little, and you were likely to die at a young age of some horrible disease. You'd probably have no teeth by now. It would be particularly awful if you were a woman.": "Elon",
  "For me, the end of childhood came when the number of candles on my birthday cake no longer reflected my age, around 19 or 20. From then on, each candle came to represent an entire decade.": "Yotam",
  "There's a great deal to say in the Bible about the signs we're to watch for, and when these signs all converge at one place we can be sure that we're close to the end of the age.": "Billy",
  "We always think, 'Well, for a person who's blind, it must be an amazing, joyful miracle if by some chance their sight is restored to them.' Now, this may be true for blind people who lost their vision at a later age. It's rarely true for people who were born blind or who go blind at a very young age.": "Rosemary",
  "At the age of nine, I could cross the length of Glasgow on a succession of buses, wearing regulation garter-topped stockings and compulsory cap and - if I'd done well enough to earn the honour in last week's test - with a First World War medal on a striped ribbon pinned to my brown blazer. I must have looked like a chocolate soldier.": "Ronald",
  "If the Age of Sport has been all champagne and roses hitherto, then expect our love affair with its newly-acquired prominence to become increasingly tainted by scandals about cheating. Sport is losing its shine and allure.": "Martin",
  "We live in such an age of chatter and distraction. Everything is a challenge for the ears and eyes.": "Rebecca",
  "I knew what I wanted to do in sport from the age of nine.": "Magdalena",
  "I was born three weeks early, and I kept being ill. From the age of zero to four, I was always in hospital having tests done, but they couldn't find out what was wrong. They discovered that one of my kidneys wasn't working properly, and it had scarred. I had to have 32 injections in my arm in the morning and evening to try and make me better.": "Liam",
  "I was already, I think, at the age of 18, showing signs of being incompetent in the lab.": "Peter",
  "The last thing I wanted was to be with someone who's the same age as me and wanted the limelight, wanted the attention. There's lots of girls out there who do.": "Gareth",
  "As I'm traveling around, I meet many small children. And when I look at a small and think how we've harmed this beautiful planet since I was that age, I feel a kind of desperation, anger, shame. I don't know what I feel; I just don't know what the emotion is.": "Jane",
  "Everyone is the sum total of past experiences. A character doesn't just spring to life at age thirty.": "Kelley",
  "My age has so little to do with my image of myself because at a certain point, the number just didn't fit how I felt. It has become irrelevant to me. I just don't feel like that number is representative of my spirit, of my energy or my anything!": "Christie",
  "Regardless of your marital status, your age, or the language you speak, you are a beloved spirit daughter of Heavenly Father who is destined to play a critical part in the onward movement of the gospel kingdom.": "Sheri",
  "No matter what age you are, or what your circumstances might be, you are special, and you still have something unique to offer. Your life, because of who you are, has meaning.": "Barbara",
  "Age considers youth ventures. ": "Rabindranath",
  "Everyone talks about age, but it's not about age. It's about work ethic. Winning never gets old.": "Lisa",
  "In this new age of GPS, Google Earth and multidimensional digital maps, mapping is suddenly hugely relevant again.": "Hans-Ulrich",
  "Age has given me the gift of me; it just gave me what I was always longing for, which was to get to be the woman I've already dreamt of being. Which is somebody who can do rest and do hard work and be a really constant companion, a constant, tender-hearted wife to myself.": "Anne",
  "English people don't have very good diction. In France you have to pronounce very particularly and clearly, and learning French at an early age helped me enormously.": "Vivien",
  "People are looking to have more meaning in their lives. It is a sign the technology community is coming of age.": "John",
  "Age does not protect you from love. But love, to some extent, protects you from age.": "Anais",
  "Being young isn't about age, it's about being a free spirit. You can meet someone of 20 who's boring and old, or you can meet someone of 70 who's youthful and exciting. I met Fred Astaire when he was 72 and I was 21, and I fell in love with him. He certainly was a free spirit.": "Twiggy",
  "The freethinking of one age is the common sense of the next.": "Matthew",
  "Guitars have been the obsession of my life. I first picked one up at the age of four and I've been a guitar junkie ever since.": "Johnny",
  "I can't wait to be that age and hanging out with a bunch of people hanging out all day playing golf and going to the beach, all my own age. We'd be laughing and having a good time and getting loopy on our prescription drugs. Driving golf carts around. I can't wait.": "Cameron",
  "With age, you get to a place where you don't want to knock people out. You just want to give people a hug.": "Vin",
  "Your grandparents came of age in the Great Depression, when everyday life was about deprivation and sacrifice, when the economic conditions of the time were so grave and so unrelenting it would have been easy enough for the American dream to fade away.": "Tom",
  "The divine right of husbands, like the divine right of kings, may, it is hoped, in this enlightened age, be contested without danger.": "Mary",
  "I must confess, I was born at a very early age.": "Groucho",
  "If you love someone, you love someone. It doesn't matter; age, colour, c'mon!": "Sam",
  "The irony is that the more we fight age, the more it shows. Paint on a 50-year-old face brings to mind a Gilbert and Sullivan comic figure. Smooth the cheeks, and suddenly the ear lobes and hands look out of place. Do we run around in October, painting the gold leaves green?": "Karen",
  "Legend: A lie that has attained the dignity of age.": "H.",
  "Old age is just a record of one's whole life.": "Muhammad",
  "I was five years old; I got addicted to being on stage. I felt like it was the most wonderful place on Earth, performing in front of an audience, who in this case were a bunch of classmates, kids my age.": "Shakira",
  "Millennials regularly draw ire for their cell phone usage. They're mobile natives, having come of age when landlines were well on their way out and payphones had gone the way of dinosaurs. Because of their native fluency, Millennials recognize mobile phones can do a whole lot more than make calls, enable texting between friends or tweeting.": "Chelsea",
  "I don't know what's happened to me. I've got a bit more sophisticated in my old age. I like a bit of jasmine tea. I love it.": "Danny",
  "From a young age, I was rubbing elbows with a very different kind of person and social class, and I felt a lot of tension and conflict in my identity because of that.": "David",
  "As men get older, the toys get more expensive.": "Marvin",

  "Middle age is when your age starts to show around your middle.": "Bob",
  "Everybody is playing games. There are games now for pretty much every age, every demographic.": "Jesse",
  "I read all the time that people think I'm arrogant. They say I am cocky, a bad character. I had that from a young age. But when they meet me, they say, 'That image doesn't fit you.'": "Zlatan",
  "The arrogance of age must submit to be taught by youth.": "Edmund",
  "No man was ever so completely skilled in the conduct of life, as not to receive new information from age and experience.": "Jonathan",

  "We are in an age of technology where we sit in our little cubicles and we IM each other and Skype each other and never connect as human beings.": "Sarah",
  "In the summer of 1954, after several years in Austin, Minnesota, our family moved across the state to the small, rural town of Worthington, where my dad became regional manager for a life insurance company. To me, at age 7, Worthington seemed a perfectly splendid spot on the earth.": "Tim",
  "There is always some specific moment when we become aware that our youth is gone; but, years after, we know it was much later.": "Mignon",
  "I am, as I've said, merely competent. But in an age of incompetence, that makes me extraordinary.": "Billy",
  "I have always paid income tax. I object only when it reaches a stage when I am threatened with having nothing left for my old age - which is due to start next Tuesday or Wednesday.": "Noel",
  "I believe that parents need to make nutrition education a priority in their home environment. It's crucial for good health and longevity to instill in your children sound eating habits from an early age.": "Cat",
  "Although I sometimes enjoy writing from an adult's perspective, I feel dedicated to the coming of age story - that part of a young person's life where he must make a decision that will change his life forever. I still remember what it's like to be twelve years old.": "Kimberly",
  "Why do people talk of the horrors of old age? It's great. I feel like a fine old car with the parts gradually wearing out, but I'm not complaining,... Those who find growing old terrible are people who haven't done what they wanted with their lives.": "Martha",
  "Living in an age of advertisement, we are perpetually disillusioned. The perfect life is spread before us every day, but it changes and withers at a touch.": "J.",

  "The heresy of one age becomes the orthodoxy of the next.": "Helen",
  "Today when I think about diversity, I actually think about the word 'inclusion.' And I think this is a time of great inclusion. It's not men, it's not women alone. Whether it's geographic, it's approach, it's your style, it's your way of learning, the way you want to contribute, it's your age - it is really broad.": "Ginni",
  "I do wish I could tell you my age but it's impossible. It keeps changing all the time.": "Greer",
  "I think that age as a number is not nearly as important as health. You can be in poor health and be pretty miserable at 40 or 50. If you're in good health, you can enjoy things into your 80s.": "Bob",
  "But the age of chivalry is gone. That of sophisters, economists, and calculators has succeeded; and the glory of Europe is extinguished forever.": "Edmund",
  "In Latino culture, the quinceanera's a big thing - it's when a girl becomes a woman. But I think age is just a number - you become a woman with the responsibilities you take on and the decisions you make. I started realizing that every day is a gift - you have every day to be thankful you're alive.": "Emily",
  "At three years of age, the child has already laid the foundations of the human personality and needs the special help of education in the school. The acquisitions he has made are such that we can say the child who enters school at three is an old man.": "Maria",
  "We have entered an age in which education is not just a luxury permitting some men an advantage over others. It has become a necessity without which a person is defenseless in this complex, industrialized society. We have truly entered the century of the educated man.": "Lyndon",

  "I knew at a young age, whether I was playing baseball or hockey or lacrosse, that my teammates were counting on me, whether it be to strike the last batter out in a baseball game or score a big goal in a hockey game.": "Wayne",
  "It wasn't until I left that I realised it's not weird to grow up in certain cities and, by the age of 27 or 28, for all of your friends to still be alive. I can think of a lot of kids that I knew in Chicago who were supposed to grow up but didn't.": "Chance",
  "Everyone in the world should have a trench coat, and there should be a trench coat for everyone in the world. It does not matter your age; it doesn't matter your gender.": "Angela",
  "Romance isn't measured by how viral your proposal goes. The Internet age may try to sell you something different, but don't ever forget that viral is closely associated with sickness - so don't ever make being viral your goal.": "Ann",
  "Being nice to everybody, saying hello to everyone in the room, signing every autograph; it was instilled in me at a very young age that this was what I was suppose to do. But I don't think it helps at all. I see more people who are rude or arrogant being rewarded - but, this way, I can put my head on the pillow at night.": "Brooke",
  "Every child needs to have for itself not only its loving parents and siblings and friends of its own age, but a grown-up friend.": "P.",

  "Young man, the secret of my success is that at early age I discovered that I was not God.": "Oliver",
  "I was very curious about the world even at a young age, and I don't know at what point I became aware that other cultures believed in different religions, and my question was, 'Well, why don't they get to go to Heaven then?'": "Brad",
  "How incessant and great are the ills with which a prolonged old age is replete.": "C.",
  "Gray hairs seem to my fancy like the soft light of the moon, silvering over the evening of life.": "Jean",
  "My first recognition of age setting in was exactly on my 36th birthday. I have no idea why, on this day of all days, I looked in the mirror and realized my face no longer looked young.": "Paulina",
  "I want to get old gracefully. I want to have good posture, I want to be healthy and be an example to my children.": "Sting",
  "Our scientific age demands that we provide definitions, measurements, and statistics in order to be taken seriously. Yet most of the important things in life cannot be precisely defined or measured. Can we define or measure love, beauty, friendship, or decency, for example?": "Dennis",
  "Every age can be enchanting, provided you live within it.": "Brigitte",
  "You have to age gracefully. And that's what I love about Keith Richards. That's what I love about the Rolling Stones. They are aging gracefully. They are falling apart at the seams right before our eyes, and they are doing it gracefully. And that's the most beautiful thing that we can do.": "Nikki",
  "The Tibetans are dirty. They wash once a year and, except for festivals, seldom change their clothes till they begin to drop off. They are healthy and hardy; even the women can carry weights of sixty pounds over the passes. They attain extreme old age; their voices are harsh and loud, and their laughter is noisy and hearty.": "Isabella",

  "Old age is the verdict of life.": "Amelia",
  "Old age and sickness bring out the essential characteristics of a man.": "Felix",
  "No, no, I was only funny on stage, really. I, I, think I was funny as a person toward my classmates when I was very young. You know, when I was a child, up to about the age of 12.": "Rowan",
  "The delight of opening a new pursuit, or a new course of reading, imparts the vivacity and novelty of youth even to old age.": "Isaac",
  "I was born on the other side of the tracks, in public housing in Brooklyn, New York. My dad never made more than $20,000 a year, and I grew up in a family that lost health insurance. So I was scarred at a young age with understanding what it was like to watch my parents lose access to the American dream.": "Howard",
  "The most formative time of our lives are the years between birth and age 21, when we explore who we are and learn from those who surround us.": "Ben",
  "At the earliest age, when I saw a 'wet paint' sign, I had to touch the paint to see if it was wet. When I get stopped at the stoplight in the middle of the night, and there's just no cars coming, and the light is red, I go. I don't think I'm putting anyone in harm's way, and I'll just take the consequences. Because I'm a Libertarian.": "Gary",
  "It feels like there's something for everyone in video games. It's not just a toy for a certain age group. It's steeped in the culture now.": "Rich",

  "I don't know if it's just my age or the climate or the high altitude or some of those old-cowboy values rubbing off on me, but I've grown slightly mellower living in Wyoming. I think if you ride into the West on a high horse, you pretty soon end up in a pile of manure.": "Alexandra",

  "At a young age winning is not the most important thing... the important thing is to develop creative and skilled players with good confidence.": "Arsene",
  "Time, in general, has always been a central obsession of mine - what it does to people, how it can constitute a plot all on its own. So naturally, I am interested in old age.": "Anne",
  "I figured out it was a social thing, what women were allowed to do. At a very young age, I decided I was not going to follow women's rules.": "Joan",
  "I shall not grow conservative with age.": "Elizabeth",
  "You had to learn at a certain age what sarcasm is, you know?": "Penny",
  "I believe in miracles. At the age of 13, I was on holiday in Moscow with my mother. It was the only trip I took in my whole childhood. We stepped off a metro train and were approached by a talent scout who told me that she wanted to sign me to her modeling agency.": "Olga",
  "Up until the age of 12, I went to dog shows every weekend. Mum showed beagles. It's a really competitive and eclectic world filled with characters who wear interesting outfits - similar to 'Toddlers & Tiaras,' but with dogs.": "Rebel",
  "I find age such a foreign concept. I have to be reminded. I still have the extraordinary feeling of adventure, striking out into unknown fields.": "William",
  "When I first started swinging a bat, I swung righty. So one time, my dad came home, and he wanted to see my batting stance. So I showed him. He says, 'You don't hit right-handed. You hit left-handed.' At that age I didn't even really think about it. Just like 'all right,' and I switched hands. He said I'd thank him later.": "Prince",
  "I love coming of age stories that have struggle.": "Aaron",
  "I was taught from a very early age that I had to work twice as hard to get half as much. That was the world I grew up in - a very strong work ethic.": "Larry",
  "A graceful and honorable old age is the childhood of immortality.": "Pindar",
  "Girls' inner critics are starting to reveal themselves at a younger and younger age. And body image issues are an aspect of their lives which is causing them low self esteem and day-to-day suffering.": "Elizabeth",
  "At the age of 12 I won the school prize for Best English Essay. The prize was a copy of Somerset Maugham's 'Introduction To Modern English And American Literature.' To this day I keep it on the shelf between my collection of Forester's works and the little urn that contains my mother's ashes.": "Wilbur",
  "The closing years of life are like the end of a masquerade party, when the masks are dropped.": "Cesare",
  "Old age is a shipwreck.": "Charles",
  "The answer to old age is to keep one's mind busy and to go on with one's life as if it were interminable. I always admired Chekhov for building a new house when he was dying of tuberculosis.": "Leon",
  "When I turned 60, it didn't bother me at all.": "Yoko",
  "The question isn't at what age I want to retire, it's at what income.": "George",

  "Industrialization based on machinery, already referred to as a characteristic of our age, is but one aspect of the revolution that is being wrought by technology.": "Emily",
  "Despite what anti-aging ads say, growing older can be better. I feel better in my skin, 100 percent. You have greater effects of gravity, but the better sense of yourself you have is something I wouldn't trade. Women who lie about their age - 'why?'": "Demi",
  "We tend to think of age only in time, but I don't think it has much to do with time at all; there's a whole load of other things. I've met 16-year-olds who are old and 90-year-olds who are young.": "Roger",
  "I'll tell you, there is nothing better in life than being a late bloomer. I believe that success can happen at any time and at any age.": "Salma",
  "There are no college courses to build up self-esteem or high school or elementary school. If you don't get those values at a early age, nurtured in your home, you don't get them.": "T.",
  "Harper Lee and Truman Capote became friends as next-door neighbors in the late 1920s, when they were about kindergarten age. From the start, they recognized in each other \"an apartness,\" as Capote later expressed it; and both loved reading. When Lee's father gave them an old Underwood typewriter, they began writing original stories together.": "Charles",
  "What's changed is we now have good anatomical, geological, archaeological evidence that Neanderthals are not our ancestors. When I wrote 'Lucy,' I considered Neanderthals ancestors of modern humans. We have gone back twice the age of Lucy, six million years. And we see that upright bipedal walking goes back that far in time.": "Donald",
  "It is imperative to change the way we look at education. We should invest in the foundation of school readiness from birth to age 5.": "James",
  "We're seeing a new 'Gilded Age,' where inheritance is a deciding factor in who becomes the wealthiest.": "Annalee",
  "Until the age of five, my parents spoke to me in Chinese or a combination of Chinese and English, but they didn't force me to speak Mandarin. In retrospect, this was sad, because they believed that my chance of doing well in America hinged on my fluency in English. Later, as an adult, I wanted to learn Chinese.": "Amy",

  "The mind that is wise mourns less for what age takes away than what it leaves behind. ": "William",
  "Old age is far more than white hair, wrinkles, the feeling that it is too late and the game finished, that the stage belongs to the rising generations. The true evil is not the weakening of the body, but the indifference of the soul.": "Andre",
  "We are living in the machine age. For the first time in history the comedian has been compelled to supply himself with jokes and comedy material to compete with the machine. Whether he knows it or not, the comedian is on a treadmill to oblivion.": "Fred",

  "There's no excuse for fur in this day and age.": "Stella",
  "There's no way to approach anything in an objective way. We're completely subjective; our view of the world is completely controlled by who we are as human beings, as men or women, by our age, our history, our profession, by the state of the world.": "Charlie",
  "My father was sleepless most of his life. So by the age of five, I was awake with him all night long, watching bad television or we'd lie in the same bed, and I'd read my comic books while he read his latest spy or mystery novel.": "Sherman",
  "I'm well past the age where I'm acceptable. You get to a certain age and you are forbidden access. You're not going to get the kind of coverage that you would like in music magazines, you're not going to get played on radio and you're not going to get played on television. I have to survive on word of mouth.": "David",
  "I came of age believing that, no matter what happened, I would always be able to support myself.": "William",
  "I don't care about age very much.": "Chinua",
  "Men are allowed to age. Men are allowed to gain weight. Men are allowed to be quirky looking.": "Janeane",
  "I have a fear of poverty in old age. I have this vision of myself living in a skip and eating cat food. It's because I'm freelance, and I've never had a proper job. I don't have a pension, and my savings are dwindling. I always thought someone would just come along and look after me.": "Jenny",
  "My mother is an incredibly beautiful woman who has laughed at every single thing my father's ever said. At a young age, my brother and I understood that if you can make girls laugh, you can punch well above your weight class.": "Seth",
  "Sometimes I think it would be easier to avoid old age, to die young, but then you'd never complete your life, would you? You'd never wholly know you.": "Marilyn",
  "When somebody who makes movies for a living - either as an actor, writer, producer or director - lives to be a certain age, you have to admire them. It is an act of courage to make a film - a courage for which you are not prepared in the rest of life. It is very hard and very destructive. But we do it because we love it.": "John",
  "'Stand By Me' was really great for me and my buddies we'd all watch that together because that was us - we were down in the creek and hanging out every day and going on little adventures. I had about sixteen friends who are all about the same age as me and lived in a three-block radius. We spent our entire childhood down in that creek. ": "Scoot",
  "You can't be crazy and wild when you're on work time. But, I like it, in that sense I think it makes you a better person for having matured at a younger age.": "Kay",
  "I grew up in this poor place, with very limited circumstances, at about 16 years of age was sent by my family to work, and instead of remaining in the position into which I was sent, I somehow worked my way out of it without any help from anyone, just luck.": "Jamaica",
  "I never grew up thinking the goal in life was to be a millionaire. All the way through college, I had a part-time job. I worked hard to get the things that you need at that age.": "Cecelia",
  "I like texting as much as the next kidult - and embrace it as yet more evidence, along with email, that we live now in the post-aural age, when an unsolicited phone call is, thankfully, becoming more and more understood to be an unspeakable social solecism, tantamount to an impertinent invasion of privacy.": "Will",
  "The number of people my age, younger now, a whole generation younger, who are fiercely bright, over-educated, under-employed and who are politicised and purposeless really upsets me. It's soul-destroying.": "Benedict",
  "Women have made tons of progress. But we still have a small percentage of the top jobs in any industry, in any nation in the world. I think that's partly because from a very young age, we encourage our boys to lead and we call our girls bossy.": "Sheryl",
  "If a brain is exercised properly, anyone can grow intelligence, at any age, and potentially by a lot. Or you can just let your brain idle - and watch it slowly, inexorably, go to seed like a sedentary body.": "Michael",
  "The reason I always loved 'The Omen' so much, and what has always been scariest to me, is anything to do with God. Anything to do with God is quite frightening because fear is something that's very much expressed in a church environment, and I grew up in one. And the fear of God was very much instilled me at a very young age.": "KaDee",
  "We, as artists, we have the right to express ourselves. That is our first amendment, freedom of speech. But I also believe that we have an obligation to the youth to be somewhat responsible in what we say on records. But I think that comes with age. I think that comes with artists growing up and becoming assured of who they are as people.": "Ja",
  "My nieces and my nephews think the only thing that I do is 'Ice Age.' That's fine with me because pretty soon they'll grow up enough to realize that I suck or that my time has passed, whichever it might be.": "Denis",
  "I don't care about age very much. I think back to the old people I knew when I was growing up, and they always seemed larger than life.": "Chinua",
  "When you grumble about a taxi being dirty, people your own age will absolutely agree with you, whereas younger people say, 'You should be so lucky to have a taxi - I walk to work!' So I have lots of young friends, who fortunately don't treat me as a guru, a person that knows all the answers.": "Ian",
  "There's no such thing as old age. I'm no different now than I was 50 years ago. I'm just having more fun.": "Philip",
  "A lot of people are frightened by old age - by being around people who are, basically, on their way out - but I'm fascinated by it. It's an amazing thing to be around someone who has had a life well lived.": "Cate",
  "Truly, learning appears to be a reverse geometric progression with experiences at one hour, one day, one month or one year dramatically more influential and formative than later experiences. As has often been quoted, 85% of brain development takes place by age 3, and yet we spend only 4% of our educational dollars by that point.": "George",
  "How young can you die of old age?": "Steven",
  "You are 27 or 28 right? It is very tough to live at that age. When nothing is sure. I have sympathy with you.": "Haruki",
  "Save your money. You're going to need twice as much money in your old age as you think.": "Michael",
  "The name 'Wiz' comes from me being the youngest dude in my age group of people that I hung out with. I was pretty good at anything I tried to do, so they would call me a young wiz.": "Wiz",
  "When our son's autism was diagnosed at the age of 2, there was no clear prognosis. We didn't even know if he'd ever learn to talk. But we found talented people to work with him and he improved, slowly at first and then more rapidly.": "Claire",
  "I suppose I'm trying to build an architecture that's as timeless as possible, although we're all creatures of our age.": "David",
  "In order to dance professionally, you have to start at a young age. No matter what, your muscle structure and your bones have to be groomed from a very young age. Nobody wakes up at 17 and decides to become a ballet dancer.": "Amanda",

  "Advice in old age is foolish for what can be more absurd than to increase our provisions for the road the nearer we approach to our journey's end. ": "Marcus",
  "As I approve of a youth that has something of the old man in him, so I am no less pleased with an old man that has something of the youth. He that follows this rule may be old in body, but can never be so in mind.": "Marcus",
  "Minds ripen at very different ages.": "Stevie",

  "The enemy of society is middle class and the enemy of life is middle age.": "Orson",
  "To separate children from others of similar age and qualifications solely because of their race generates a feeling of inferiority as to their status in the community that may affect their hearts and minds in a way unlikely ever to be undone.": "Earl",
  "After 12 years, the old butterflies came back. Well, I guess at my age you call them moths.": "Franco",
  "An artist must be a reactionary. He has to stand out against the tenor of the age and not go flopping along.": "Andre",
  "A moment comes, which comes but rarely in history, when we step out from the old to the new; when an age ends; and when the soul of a nation long suppressed finds utterance.": "Jawaharlal",
  "When I came to Los Angeles, it was the first time that I ever felt like I belong somewhere. Not because it was wacky, but because people here understood what I felt like to perform, and there were other kids my age who wanted to do it. I didn't get looked at as God, you freak.": "Jennifer",
  "This is the first age that's ever paid much attention to the future, which is a little ironic since we may not have one.": "Arthur",
  "A tart temper never mellows with age, and a sharp tongue is the only edged tool that grows keener with constant use.": "Washington",
  "Nice to be here? At my age it's nice to be anywhere.": "George",
  "Interest is the spur of the people, but glory that of great souls. Invention is the talent of youth, and judgment of age.": "Jonathan",

  "Youth, what man's age is like to be, doth show; We may our ends by our beginnings know.": "John",
  "You live in a deranged age, more deranged that usual, because in spite of great scientific and technological advances, man has not the faintest idea of who he is or what he is doing.": "Walker",
  "At the age of four with paper hats and wooden swords we're all Generals. Only some of us never grow out of it.": "Peter",
  "The crucial task of old age is balance: keeping just well enough, just brave enough, just gay and interested and starkly honest enough to remain a sentient human being.": "Florida",
  "You can judge your age by the amount of pain you feel when you come in contact with a new idea.": "Pearl",
  "From birth to age 18 a girl needs good parents. From 18 to 35 she needs good looks. From 35 to 55 she needs a good personality. From 55 on, she needs good cash.": "Sophie",

  "Believe me, that was a happy age, before the days of architects, before the days of builders.": "Lucius",
  "What makes old age hard to bear is not the failing of one's faculties, mental and physical, but the burden of one's memories.": "W.",
  "I don't believe in happy endings, but I do believe in happy travels, because ultimately, you die at a very young age, or you live long enough to watch your friends die. It's a mean thing, life.": "George",
  "Experts tell us that 90% of all brain development occurs by the age of five. If we don't begin thinking about education in the early years, our children are at risk of falling behind by the time they start Kindergarten.": "Bob",

  "There have been studies that clearly state that children who are exposed to arts education at a young age will in fact do markedly better in their SAT tests.": "Marvin",
  "Ours is the age of substitutes: instead of language, we have jargon: instead of principles, slogans: and, instead of genuine ideas, bright ideas.": "Eric",
  "This is an exciting time. I believe we stand at the edge of a new age - a Golden Age - of freedom that will rival any of the great eras of world history because it will be the entire world itself that is changing.": "Joe",
  "From the age of six I wanted to be an artist. At that point I meant a painter, but it turned out what I really meant was I was someone who was very interested in watching the world and making copies of it.": "Reynolds",
  "I really took filmmaking very seriously... It was an honor and then a crutch also, because at a young age, I was like, I guess I'm a serious filmmaker. I never set out to be a serious filmmaker. I just set out to make movies.": "John",
  "It is people's hearts that move the age.": "Herbie",
  "Dissents speak to a future age.": "Ruth",

  "I ask myself why I do it. Maybe it's to prove I'm still around. It takes a lot out of my body. I'm not an NBA player anymore. At my age, very few people can handle it.": "Jerry",

  "At the age of fifteen my grandmother became the concubine of a warlord general.": "Jung",
  "In this age of consumerism film criticism all over the world - in America first but also in Europe - has become something that caters for the movie industry instead of being a counterbalance.": "Wim",

  "Look, it's to the point where kids are getting Botox. It's insane. We're not allowed to age.": "Rosanna",

  "I didn't have any concept of age or authority. I remember realising, Oh, the world has rules and we don't.": "Moon",
  "The young people have MTV and rock and roll. Why would they go to read poetry? Poetry belongs to the Stone Age. It awakens in us perceptions that go back to those times.": "Robert",
  "I started playing ukulele first for 2 years from age 9 to 11 and got my first guitar and got inspired by blues I heard on the radio that turned me on and I started learning myself.": "Johnny",
  "The love story for me was the nature of the love and not the age of the lovers.": "Kate",
  "I reluctantly left the series because a) my age. I'm 68 tomorrow and time is very precious for me to spend time at home with my family and especially with the grandchildren. They're aged 7 and 5. After three years I became homesick for my home.": "Richard",
  "If you look at body fat, it seems to increase with age, even though your weight does not. That's a physiological fact of aging, they say. Heck it is. It is an adaptive effect of aging.": "Kenneth",
  "If you watch Cheers, in 12 years they didn't age a day.": "William",
  "I don't need you to remind me of my age. I have a bladder to do that for me.": "Stephen",

  "Every year 3.1 million Indian children die before the age of 5, mostly from diseases of poverty like diarrhea.": "Nicholas",
  "Yes, my life is a life of combat; I can say that this has never stopped for a single instant. It is a combat that started for me at the age of 16. I'm 90 years old now, and my motivation hasn't changed; it's the same fervour that drives me.": "Ahmed",

  "Another belief of mine; that everyone else my age is an adult, whereas I am merely in disguise.": "Margaret",
  "In an age robbed of religious symbols, going to the shops replaces going to the church. We have a free choice, but at a price. We can win experience, but never achieve innocence. Marx knew that the epic activities of the modern world involve not lance and sword but dry goods.": "Stephen",

  "No lie ever reaches old age.": "Sophocles",
  "What turns me on about the digital age, what excited me personally, is that you have closed the gap between dreaming and doing. You see, it used to be that if you wanted to make a record of a song, you needed a studio and a producer. Now, you need a laptop.": "Bono",
  "I'm asked all the time in interviews about who I am, and I know a few people my age who have a strong sense of self, but I couldn't say I know myself and sum it up and give it to you in a little package. I don't know myself at all yet.": "Kristen",
  "I believe that investing in our children's development from the earliest age is the single most important contribution we can make to the health and wellbeing of our citizens, their capacity and the future prosperity of our state.": "Jay",

  "I've reached the age of self-knowledge, so I don't know anything. People who claim that they know something are responsible for most of the fuss in the world.": "Wislawa",

  "You need some insecurity if you're an actor. It keeps the pot boiling. I haven't yet started to think about retiring. I was shocked when I heard about Paul Newman retiring at age 82. Most actors just fade away like old soldiers.": "Al",
  "We live in an age of mediocrity.": "Lauren",
  "I think the most exciting thing is that you expect people our age to know the music, but actually a lot of kids know the music, and if anything is left, we have left really good music, and that's the important part, not the mop-tops or whatever.": "Ringo",

  "The age in which we live, this non-stop distraction, is making it more impossible for the young generation to ever have the curiosity or discipline... because you need to be alone to find out anything.": "Vivienne",
  "I've had to be a man since I was 12 or 13. I had a job. And I was playing the piano for people twice my age. Handling responsibility is what makes a man a man.": "Jamie",
  "I wear clothes that most people in the Midwest would probably deem inappropriate at my age. And I rock a bikini all summer long. I know that it's not normal, but I just don't care. I live once.": "Liz",

The broadband platform the industry has deployed is a critical part of the infrastructure needed to realize our national ambition to be a great nation in the Information Age.": "Michael",
  "I grew up in the suburbs among highly educated people, in a house crammed with books. It was a culture rich in ideas, stimulation, entertainment, and mental activity, all helpful to the nurture of an imaginative child who wanted from an early age to be a writer.": "Stephen",
  "To write a story about New York that only deals with people in your age and socioeconomic bracket, that feels dishonest to me. So much of New York comes from everyone bumping into each other.": "Josh",
  "The bottom line is that we have entered an age when local communities need to invest in themselves. Federal and state dollars are becoming more and more scarce for American cities. Political and civic leaders in local communities need to make a compelling case for this investment.": "Mick",
  "We all want to be special, to stand out; there's nothing wrong with this. The irony is that every human being is special to start with, because we're unique to start with. But we then go through some sort of boot camp from the age of zero to about 18 where we learn everything we can about how not to be unique.": "Karl",
  "My big running discovery was around Stanley Park in Vancouver. Miss it. That's a six-mile loop. Now I smile when I get four miles done. Age is a beast.": "Michael",
  "I actually think the whole concept of retirement is a bit stupid, so yes, I do want to do something else. There is this strange thing that just because chronologically on a Friday night you have reached a certain age... with all that experience, how can it be that on a Monday morning, you are useless?": "Stuart",
  "The Industrial Age is not sustainable. It's not sustainable in ecological terms, and it's not sustainable in human terms.": "Peter",
  "My dad says that when I was two or three I used to go out dressed as a different character every day. I remember thinking it was perfectly normal to wear different coloured shoes and carry a pink umbrella. But now I've got a goddaughter of that age I realise it's not normal at all. ": "Alice",
  "You start at a young age, going on auditions, and you think you did a good job and expect to get that role, and you don't, and it's a letdown, a disappointment. So you tell yourself to just do the work and disconnect, because you have no control over the outcome.": "Michael",
  "There are things that tend to moderate with age. Schizophrenia is somewhat like that.": "John",
  "We live in an age of great jitteriness in the financial markets. And there's no doubt at all, I think, that the volume of computer-traded stocks has helped contribute to that.": "Robert",
  "Teachers are not supposed to be repositories of information which they dish out. That is from an age when there were no other repositories of information, other than books or teachers, neither of which were portable. A lot of my big task is retraining these teachers.": "Sugata",
  "I think no matter what age you are, you know when you love something in your heart.": "Cindy",
  "Religion triggers a lot of emotions in me, most of which stem from being raised Jewish in a very Baptist community in the South. I didn't believe any of it from an early age - the clubby quality of whatever religion or church you belonged to, Judaism included. It just struck me as foolish.": "David",
  "The story of 'Mirror Mirror' is in many ways a story about evolution. It's about the evolution of a child into an adult. It's about the evolution of those dwarves into something a little less rock-like, a little more humanoid. It's about the evolution of history, too, from the darkness of the Middle Ages into the light of the Age of Reason.": "Gregory",
  "It used to cost money to disclose and distribute information. In the digital age it costs money not to.": "Heather",
  "The bulk of my fans are my age, and I'm aging at the same rate they are. That makes me relevant. They like hearing what I have to say. I work hard at it, but it's addicting, really.": "Ron",
  "I am not a big technology person. I don't go on the Internet really much at all. Drawing is like a zen thing; it's private, which in this day and age is harder to come by.": "Tim",
  "I know that might sound silly coming from someone my age, but I remember on my 14th birthday having a crisis like my mom should be having. I kept thinking that I was getting older, and I haven't really accomplished anything. I remember thinking that I better accomplish something real soon.": "Q'orianka",
  "I think people under age 55 come to Vegas with a certain sense of irony.": "Penn",
  "The industrial age was not about craftspeople trading peer to peer. It was about stopping that. You weren't supposed to be a craftsperson, you were supposed to be an employee.": "Douglas",
  "Solitude is good in the evening. Dublin is a quiet city when you get to a certain age, when your friends settle down and have kids. Nothing much happens here.": "Colm",
  "I knew from the age of five what I wanted to do. The one thing I could do was draw. I couldn't draw that much better than some of the other kids, but I cared more and I wanted it badly.": "Chuck",
  "Prom has all the elements of a popular story. It reeks of all-Americanness, tension, drama. It has romance. Pretty dresses. Dancing. Limos. High school. Coming of age.": "Adora",
  "Soon, I'm going to meet somebody around my own age, and she's going to be smart and beautiful, and I'm going to date her daughter.": "Bob",
  "Two of my three siblings are older, so I suppose I learned from them and became a very avid reader at a young age, which I think enough cannot be said for what you can discover through literature.": "Julia",
  "A lot of movie stars are not great actors; they're just very good-looking. And when they start to age and they don't have the looks any more, then it's over.": "Michael",
  "A lot of people who start work at a very young age never grow up because they never got that opportunity to be a child, so they hold on to that and still do a lot of childish, silly things.": "Janet",
  "In 1977, at age ten, I was cast on the TV sitcom 'Good Times.' My character was Penny, an abused child in desperate need of love. I really didn't want to do the show. I didn't want to be away from my family.": "Janet",
  "I've never been willing to lie about my age. Why on earth would I want to tell people I'm 35, which I'm not, and have them say, 'Oh that's nice,' when I could tell them I'm 47, which I am, and have them look at me and go, 'Whoa!'. I'm not afraid of aging. I stopped being afraid of life a long time ago.": "Sharon",
  "The most inspiring piece of advice I've gotten is simply to persevere. My mom taught me to always keep going no matter what from an early age. When it feels too difficult to push forward, I always remind myself, 'This too shall pass,' and then I redouble my efforts.": "Liya",
  "In this age of the electronic media and the mass distribution of the printed word, God will hold us accountable if we do not now move the Book of Mormon in a monumental way.": "Ezra",
  "We have to program the mind of the public that age is not ugly. Age is just age. Wake up, American children, and stop listening to other people's voices. Know yourself, be true to yourself and make a contribution. It took me half my life to know myself. I listened to other people's opinions and took them as gospel.": "Carmen",
  "Like the rest of the city, LAX is coming of age.": "Dana",
  "A house with any kind of age will have dozens of stories to tell. I suppose if a novelist could live long enough, one could base an entire oeuvre on the lives that weave in and out of an antique house.": "Anita",
  "In an instant, the law was transformed: from the last passenger on the safe-haven bandwagon to a pioneer into uncharted territory. For the first time in American history, it was not only legal to relinquish a baby; in Nebraska, it was okay to abandon any child of any age for any reason at any time - with the full protection of the law.": "Wil",
  "I go back to family: 'Ice Age' was about disparate characters rejected by their own kind. They come together to save the child. 'Despicable Me' is about redefining what a family could be. It has a visual distinction and an experimental quality.": "Chris",
  "I want to do roles that take women a step farther. I don't want to be slotted into anything. But if I get a brilliant role which requires me to be a mother, then I will do it. But I want people to see that a woman could be anything at whatever age, even if she is married or has two kids.": "Madhuri",
  "I feel like old age in America is a very sad thing. I have been many different places around the world where getting older is something you look forward to.": "Alice",
  "Old age may have its limitations and challenges, but in spite of them, our latter years can be some of the most rewarding and fulfilling of our lives.": "Billy",
  "I myself got married at a very young age. It has always intrigued me because marriage is very synthetic in an otherwise natural world.": "Imtiaz",
  "You label somebody 'New Age,' and that's automatic mockery: 'She cannot possibly be a serious thinker.'": "Marianne",
  "Grief is exhausting. When you learn - maybe through my age or experience - trying to harness the energy, whatever it is, muted energy or a concentration to find yourself in a place? You try to use it for when it's really necessary and can arrive.": "Ciaran",
  "That's the privilege of old age: You don't have to remember.": "Alan",
  "There's a lot of things lost in the Digital Age.": "Ira",
  "I embrace old age. Look, I'm never going to dunk on LeBron James, and I've learned to accept that. I got a pretty good life, and I'm very fortunate, and I have my blessings.": "Mark",
  "Every age has found some alternative to American values appealing. The number of Western intellectuals enamored of fascism and all the various expressions of Marxism was legion.": "Dennis",
  "I get recognized in the street really frequently, which is really shocking. I'm excruciatingly wary of any female under the age of 19. Even when some of them come up to me, they're usually very cordial, nice and polite.": "Ian",
  "Everyone has an internal age, a time in life when one is, if not one's best, then at very least one's most authentic self. I always felt that my internal clock was calibrated somewhere between 47 and 53 years old.": "David",
  "When I was in my teens and 20s, I looked to older Italian and French women. They always seemed so incredibly attractive to me because of their confidence. And because their faces had evidence of age: lines, dark circles, and half-lidded eyes, it made that confidence so rebellious. And that was incredibly attractive to me.": "Justine",
  "Here's my theory: If a person gets worldwide fame at a young age, they're emotionally frozen at that moment. For me, that's 15 to 18, so you find yourself in your mid-20s being a glorified 15-year-old. What could possibly go wrong?": "Rob",
  "It's a tender and complicated dance, watching our parents age. We become protective in ways we never were before, and we study them with a mix of sadness and curiosity: Is this what we will be like when we are their age? We tell ourselves to be patient - just answer the same question again as if it wasn't answered a moment ago.": "Patti",
  "Whatever China I'd been born into, I would probably still have become a painter - I loved sketching portraits as a child, and began art classes at the age 7. But if China hadn't been under Maoist rule, I might never have become a writer.": "Ma",
  "I did telemarketing for years, starting at the age of 16, just selling steak knives to old people. Old people go through a weird amount of steak knives. I also sold straight meat over the telephone.": "Adam",
  "I was named after my Jewish grandfather who left Poland early in the 20th century. What I knew from an early age was that he had lived most of his life in England, his Jewish wife had died, and he married a non-Jewish woman who was my grandmother.": "Morris",
  "If you are fortunate in life, age and knowledge breed compassion.": "Ronnie",
  "My love for American music and American movies is from an early age. I was 10 or 11 when I heard Fats Domino and Little Richard and Buddy Holly. And the movies, my dad used to take my brother and I to the movies every Friday. It was incredible: we got to see just about every movie that came out for a period of years.": "Ian",
  "Loving someone liberates the lover as well as the beloved. And that kind of love comes with age.": "Maya",
  "Each age, it is found, must write its own books; or rather, each generation for the next succeeding.": "Ralph",
  "I remember at the age of five travelling on a trolley car with my mother past a group of women on a picket line at a textile plant, seeing them being viciously beaten by security people. So that kind of thing stayed with me.": "Noam",
  "I don't like it when people who are young act like they're 40. That's taking too much on. Putting up a shield and trying to act like you're so mature or whatever - I don't try to act mature. Some people might say I'm mature for my age, but it's not something I'm trying to do, you know? I'm just me.": "Taylor",
  "We were never supposed to live until 40. We were built to self-destruct at 30, whether from cancer or mental illness. We're all going way beyond our expiration date.": "Douglas",
  "If Beethoven had been killed in a plane crash at the age of 22, it would have changed the history of music and of aviation.": "Tom",
  "Age merely shows what children we remain.": "Johann",
  "People forget how dominant Public Enemy became in the mid '80s. No one talks about how transformative they were. And then that led to the '90s and the sort of East Coast v. West Coast stuff, which is kinda when I came of age.": "Marco",
  "You've gotta understand that with branding and the way things are promoted, in our day and age, your older movie stars are not reachable or accessible because they're not a part of the whole social media world.": "Kevin",
  "The shades of respectability begin to close about the greying head.": "Mason",
  "'Bombing Afghanistan back into the Stone Age' was quite a favourite headline for some wobbly liberals. The slogan does all the work. But an instant's thought shows that Afghanistan is being, if anything, bombed out of the Stone Age.": "Christopher",
  "I think it's less common in France that a man at the age of 50 buys a Porsche and gets a young girlfriend.": "Carine",
  "We're past the age of heroes and hero kings... Most of our lives are basically mundane and dull, and it's up to the writer to find ways to make them interesting.": "John",
  "We must all rise to the challenge to demonstrate that security and prosperity in the Internet age are not only compatible with liberty, they ultimately depend on it.": "Rebecca",
  "I am lucky, I don't have aches and pains. I do Pilates regularly, which is a series of stretching exercises, and I recommend it to anyone of my age because the temptation is not to exercise when you get older. Well, you should.": "Ian",
  "Every comedian is furious. Age makes me angry. I'm unhappy at not being able to open packages anymore. I'm angry that libraries have gone. I hate children on planes. I'm very shallow, so they tend to be little things. To be honest, I think I was probably angry the day I was born, you know, about diapers or something.": "Joan",
  "At age nine, I got a paper route. Sixty-six papers had to be delivered to sixty-six families every day. I also had to collect thirty cents a week from each customer. I owed the paper twenty cents per customer per week, and got to keep the rest. When I didn't collect, the balance came out of my profit. My average income was six dollars a week.": "Lou",
  "At a young age, I was interested in comic books, which was really how I learnt to read. The name Cage came from a comic book character called Power Man.": "Nicolas",
  "It were a real increase of human happiness, could all young men from the age of nineteen be covered under barrels, or rendered otherwise invisible; and there left to follow their lawful studies and callings, till they emerged, sadder and wiser, at the age of twenty-five.": "Thomas",
  "I think it is absolutely crazy in this day and age that I have to go through a trial and error method to see if my child is allergic to an antibiotic or peanuts. I should just know.": "Anne",
  "I never was that boy who loved gangster films, but when I was growing up, I was obsessed with the detective Dick Tracy. It was one of my favourite movies as a kid, and he really inspired me. I would have loved to be part of that golden age of Hollywood in the 1940s. It made me want to become an actor.": "Ryan",
  "With pop music, the format dictates the form to a big degree. Just think of the pop single. It has endured as a form even in the download age because bands conform to a strict format, and work, often very productively, within the parameters.": "David",
  "This is the strange thing: Dancers don't age.": "Twyla",
  "Unfortunately, in some parts of the country, some kids are taught at an early age that being different is somehow bad or wrong or worthy of ridicule.": "Matt",
  "Unlike painting, sculpture, or music, typefaces must be useful to someone. Fortunately for designers, the digital age has produced new problems to solve - developing typefaces that work on mobile phones, for one - and enabled better solutions to old problems.": "Virginia",
  "To be told that one can be dependent on one's parents until age 26 should strike a young person who wants to grow up as demeaning, not as something to celebrate.": "Dennis",
  "Human society has dense borders - economic, religious and cultural - inculcated from an early age. We hate change.": "Alejandro",
  "Most things in my life I had before leaving home. Values, support, great family. I was shaped at an early age. A musician playing guitar, I wanted to be a folk singer.": "Sissy",
  "I think we live in an age of increasing mediocrity.": "Dick",
  "Jesus is the politics of the new age He is about the establishment of a kingdom He is the one who has created a new time that gives us the time not only to care for the poor but to be poor. Jesus is the one who makes it possible to be nonviolent in a violent world. ": "Stanley",
  "Age shouldn't affect you. It's just like the size of your shoes - they don't determine how you live your life! You're either marvellous or you're boring, regardless of your age.": "Morrissey",
  "No lying knight or lying priest ever prospered in any age, but especially not in the dark ones. Men prospered then only in following an openly declared purpose, and preaching candidly beloved and trusted creeds.": "John",
  "You get to a certain age and you can't judge yourself on your dad or your parents.": "Ellie",
  "Every age has its own poetry; in every age the circumstances of history choose a nation, a race, a class to take up the torch by creating situations that can be expressed or transcended only through poetry.": "Jean-Paul",
  "And I'm afraid, in this day and age, trust, which I count so, you know, I love loyalty. I love trust.": "Elton",
  "I'm totally into new age and self-help books. I used to work in a bookstore and that's the section they gave me, and I got way into it. I just loved the power of positive thinking, letting yourself go.": "Jason",
  "My parents got married late and they had kids late, so I never felt a social or cultural thing to be married or pregnant or a homeowner by a certain age.": "Anna",
  "By age seven, I used to comb my hair for performances, just pull my hair up into a bun. Granted, it wasn't a very intricate hairstyle. Still, to be that responsible and disciplined at age seven is unusual.": "Janet",
  "I would often find myself, at the age of 21, at midnight, running down a dark street on my own with 10 men chasing me. And the fact they had cameras in their hands made that legal.": "Sienna",
  "I've been very competitive by nature from a young age, whether it was eating a bowl of pasta faster than somebody else, or always wanting to be the first one in line.": "Maria",
  "You get to a certain age where you prepare yourself for happiness. Sometimes you never remember to actually get happy.": "John",
  "I don't find the technology threatening. A lot of people my age, my generation, find it difficult to immerse themselves. But I would never preclude the idea of using any technology if I thought it suited the end result.": "Robert",
  "The excess of our youth are checks written against our age and they are payable with interest thirty years later.": "Charles",
  "No matter what your age is, you only have now. So it's always about living in the moment and being in the moment... I refuse to let those numbers define me, and I just try to face each day positively.": "Christie",
  "Light and funny has a more compelling quality when you're younger. But I haven't abandoned the genre: I love falling down I love Lucille Ball. It's just that a lot of those stories revolve around problems that I can't convincingly portray at this age. ": "Julia",
  "You have to make the effort with children. You can't have them thinking that I reckon I'm special, otherwise they'll start thinking they're special. I want them to feel normal for as long as possible because God knows they'll reach an age when they'll be told they're not.": "Noel",
  "We were really grown up for our age and it was an incredible special band.": "Joan",
  "I wrote a screenplay for a 'Sweet Valley High' adaptation, and it's really amazing to me how many women who are my age have responded to the idea and are excited about the movie.": "Diablo",
  "Religion is the best antidote to the individualism of the consumer age. The idea that society can do without it flies in the face of history and, now, evolutionary biology.": "Jonathan",
  "Tiger Woods was a month away from 34 years of age when his debutantes began turning up in the news. He was a grown man with a wife and two children. Well, we supposed he had a wife, but that was before we learned she was only an ornament.": "Dan",
  "I knew from the age of 16 that I wanted to be a writer because I just didn't think I could do anything else. So I read and read and wrote short stories and dreamed of escape.": "Paul",
  "I would always encourage people of any age not to be so quick to follow other people's truths but to search and follow your own moral code and live by your own integrity, and mostly just be brave.": "Jewel",
  "The information encoded in your DNA determines your unique biological characteristics, such as sex, eye color, age and Social Security number.": "Dave",
  "I would like to see more airplay for all artists, no matter what age. I think there's a lot of money being spent toward the young guys, but a lot of the older guys are the ones who blazed the trail for those young guys.": "Willie",
  "It's hard for women at my age in Hollywood, but I'm not discouraged.": "Jane",
  "The reality is sobering: in the United States one in three girls will become pregnant before age 20, totaling more than 750,000 girls per year.": "Jane",
  "The most important thing to do as you age is to stay physically active. Lots of people just throw in the towel if they can't do what they used to do, and that's terrible.": "Jane",
  "There is no self-knowledge but an historical one. No one knows what he himself is who does not know his fellow men, especially the most prominent one of the community, the master's master, the genius of the age.": "Karl",
  "The first thing I bought that was really stylish was in 1969 when I was eleven. I saved up for a black, grey and white tie-dye grandad vest. It was too big - they weren't catering for kids my age - and hung off me, but I loved it.": "Paul",
  "I think when the full horror of being fifty hits you, you should stay home and have a good cry.": "Josh",
  "You know you're getting old when all the names in your black book have M. D. after them.": "Harrison",
  "I'm 20 years old. I like to party as much as anyone my age. Going clubbing is my way of relaxing or releasing a lot of stress. I don't feel that I should have to justify that part of my life. I don't know that I'm necessarily an addict.": "Lindsay",
  "Oh rage! Oh despair! Oh age, my enemy!": "Pierre",
  "To be renewed is everything. What more could one ask for than to have one's youth back again?": "George",
  "The chief role of the universities is to prolong adolescence into middle age, at which point early retirement ensures that we lack the means or the will to enforce significant change.": "J.",
  "Every age needs men who will redeem the time by living with a vision of the things that are to be.": "Adlai",
  "I didn't cry much after I was 35, but staggered stony-faced into middle age, a handkerchief still in my bag just in case.": "Hilary",
  "The perceptions of middle age have their own luminosity.": "Gail",
  "A grownup is a child with layers on.": "Woody",
  "I had dance training from a very young age, 3 or 4... It taught me how to present myself, about preparation and working in an ensemble, and it's something that carries with me to this day.": "Michelle",
  "A bad manner spoils everything, even reason and justice; a good one supplies everything, gilds a No, sweetens a truth, and adds a touch of beauty to old age itself.": "Baltasar",
  "I've watched my peers get better with age and hoped that would happen with me.": "Bonnie",
  "My age and health will never allow me to realize the dream of art I've been pursuing all my life.": "Paul",
  "Confidence is something you're born with. I know I had loads of it even at the age of 15.": "Hedy",
  "My habit would have been to veer towards the dark - to prove I was something; edgy, or maybe to prove that I was cognisant of the dark side. Now, with age and confidence, I can say, yeah, that's true, but I am cognisant of the fact that people can do things well. And can be more loving than you expect.": "George",
  "Of course, you see your body changing as you age, but it's more important to live than be too preoccupied with that sort of thing. I think ultimately what people care about in other people is the energy, the spirit.": "Jacqueline",
  "I love tennis. I've played it my whole life. Loved it since the age of three. I had an injury, so from the age of 13 to 24 I didn't play much. Then when I moved out to L.A., there were so many tennis courts that I rekindled the love.": "David",
  "We, after a certain age, after college, are so consumed about what we want to achieve in life, and we fiercely are ambitious and we go after that, but sometimes we tend to take all our loved and dear ones for granted.": "Ranbir",
  "Why should society feel responsible only for the education of children, and not for the education of all adults of every age?": "Erich",
  "Reason is a crutch for age, but youth is strong enough to walk alone.": "John",
  "You hit a certain age and - especially because of TV - the young cooks coming up say, 'You're a sellout, because you're doing something other than what you should be doing.' 'Top Chef' is a double-edged sword for me: There's a whole group of people who will not come to the restaurants because they assume I'm not in them anymore, all I do is TV.": "Tom",
  "Sure I played, did you think I was born at the age of 70 sitting in a dugout trying to manage guys like you?": "Casey",
  "I got into filmmaking in order to tell very personal stories, and in this day and age, the opportunity seems all the more precious.": "Ira",
  "I'm 42 and the age of a guy who has kids, so I guess I'm playing right where I'm supposed to be. I'm comfortable with that, but in the same breath I'd do something edgy. If someone came to me and offered me an edgy and funny story, then I'd do it.": "Eddie",
  "I was just a ham since about the age of five. If I was performing at Medieval Times or something, I'd be the court jester. That was always my defense mechanism. I was never all that funny; I was just obnoxious and loud.": "Emma",
  "I get all fired up about aging in America.": "Willard",
  "We tried not to age, but time had its rage.": "Pete",
  "Old age isn't a battle old age is a massacre. ": "Philip",
  "I knew from a very young age that there was something very wrong with me.": "Patty",
  "A lot of the girls my age were impressed by silly stuff like money and fame. I wanted to be able to have intellectual and spiritual conversations with someone who was on the same page as me.": "Nick",
  "All my early school reports from the age of 5 were 'Daniel must learn not to distract others.'": "Dan",
  "It is critical that kids start to learn the value of money, short-term and long-term saving and budgeting at an early age.": "Alexa",
  "I admire those people who hold on to their elegance in old age but I'd rather have fun.": "Heather",
  "I asked all of our recruiters to give me all resumes of prospective employees with their name, gender, place of origin, and age blacked out. This simple change shocked me, because I found myself interviewing different-looking candidates - even though I was 100% convinced that I was not being biased in my resume selection process.": "Eric",
  "A woman telling her true age is like a buyer confiding his final price to an Armenian rug dealer.": "Mignon",
  "The majority of teenagers don't even make eye contact with people, even people of the same age.": "Saoirse",
  "We should so provide for old age that it may have no urgent wants of this world to absorb it from meditation on the next. It is awful to see the lean hands of dotage making a coffer of the grave.": "Pearl",
  "People quit on jobs. They quit on marriages. They quit on school. There's an immediacy of this day and age that doesn't lend itself to being committed to anything.": "Emily",
  "Although it is generally known, I think it's about time to announce that I was born at a very early age.": "Douglas",
  "I played rugby from the age of 10 until my late twenties; an unlikely player - small, quiet, long-haired and 'wiry.'": "Anthony",
  "For a guy who used to steal watches on the streets of Chandni Chowk for kicks, I surely think my success at the age of 22 was pretty early!": "Akshay",
  "Incidentally, one of the most worrying problems in the impact of Western modernity on traditional culture is that it quite rapidly communicates its own indifference or anxiety or even hostility about age and ageing.": "Rowan",
  "Middle age is the time when a man is always thinking that in a week or two he will feel as good as ever.": "Don",
  "Age is not a particularly interesting subject. Anyone can get old. All you have to do is live long enough.": "Don",
  "People of a certain age look back on the Mayberry of 'The Andy Griffith Show' and become almost as homesick for that simple fictional hamlet as they do for their own home towns.": "Tom",
  "You end up as you deserve. In old age you must put up with the face, the friends, the health, and the children you have earned.": "Judith",
  "I'm not limited by my gender, and I don't think anyone else should be either. Because I am the age I am and I sort of rode the crest of the first profound post-suffragette feminists, I wasn't fighting to burn my bra. Those women fought that fight just seconds before I came into womanhood.": "Ellen",
  "I was given a stethoscope in a child's 'doctor's bag' at about age six and I loved it! One could hear the heart beating through that plastic toy.": "Jessye",
  "I think it'd be wonderful if we could train young girls to be active in lots of ways and that they then wouldn't have to age at the same rate that they would if they were not more active. In other words, more physical fitness and not just the sporty kind, but the yoga, which is really important.": "Raquel",
  "I learned from a very young age that if I pursued the things that truly excited me, that they would reward in more important ways, like happiness.": "Brandon",
  "Youth does not require reasons for living, it only needs pretexts.": "Jose",
  "A woman must make her fortune before she is 30 or work after she is 30 or get married.": "Anna",
  "No one can avoid aging, but aging productively is something else.": "Katharine",
  "A lot of my childhood memories involve walking home in floods of tears. At that age, feeling unpopular is difficult to handle.": "Rachel",
  "When sighted people cover their eyes or find themselves in a dark place, this is something that's very terrifying for us. And so in general, we assume that this is what blindness means. But of course, it isn't. For people who were born blind or who go blind at a very young age, that's not at all what blindness means.": "Rosemary",
  "I feel increasingly like age is very irrelevant. Quite often, cynicism is confused with wisdom, and my scorn is confused with a knowing, which I don't have.": "Laura",
  "I think we put our children at an enormous disadvantage by not educating them in war, by not letting them understand about it at an early age.": "Suzanne",
  "I'm not busy... a woman with three children under the age of 10 wouldn't think my schedule looked so busy.": "Garrison",
  "What is an adult? A child blown up by age.": "Simone",
  "Basketball has consumed me since the age of 7 or 8. I don't know what I would do without it.": "Rick",

  "A lot of the time with child actors, you get the feeling they're trying to have a kind of poise or presentation that's beyond their years that might be put on, but also might be because they've spent years just hanging out with adults and they don't even have a sense of what it's like to grow up with kids their own age.": "Alessandro",
  "Well, I was always really mature for my age. I'm an above-age reader. I'm not trying to come off like, 'I have a high IQ number. My parents gave me the test.' That's the way I was, I guess.

  "It's a bit startling to achieve global recognition before the age of 30 on account of your sister, your brother-in-law and your bottom. One day I might be able to make sense of this. In the meantime I think it's fair to say that it has its upside and its downside.": "Pippa",
  "I was 3 and a half, and there was an open call for a Coca-Cola commercial. We were living around Dallas, and my mom took me.

And the way I heard about this 'Peter Pan' film was there was an open-call audition that I'd heard about, or read about, and I just thought, 'Oh, I'll go along for the fun.' Because I never dreamed in a million years I'd ever get it.": "Rachel",

  "I was trying to be 27 at age 47, but God had to get rid of my vanity. I had trouble letting go of the old Lex physically.

  "At age three, if you have a still-growing brain, it's a human behavior. In chimps, by age three, the brain is formed over 90 percent. That's why they can cope with their environment very easily after birth - faster than us, anyway. But in humans, we continue to grow our brains.

  "A happy life must be to a great extent a quiet life, for it is only in an atmosphere of quiet that true joy dare live.": "Bertrand",
  "I think most of us are raised with preconceived notions of the choices we're supposed to make.

  "The purpose of meditation is to make our mind calm and peaceful. If our mind is peaceful, we will be free from worries and mental discomfort, and so we will experience true happiness. But if our mind is not peaceful, we will find it very difficult to be happy, even if we are living in the very best conditions.": "Kelsang",

  "Traveling is the ruin of all happiness! There's no looking at a building after seeing Italy.": "Fanny",
  "I am a spiritual person in an eastern religion kind of way. I learned that happiness for all of us is a switch that you flick in your brain. It doesn't have anything to do with getting a new house, a new car, a new girlfriend, or a new pair of shoes. Our culture is very much about that; we are never happy with what we have today.": "Tom",
  "The moral and political principles that govern men are derived from three sources: revelation, natural law, and the artificial conventions of society.

  "Happiness, I do not know where to turn to discover you on earth, in the air or the sky; yet I know you exist and are no futile dream.": "Rosalia",
  "You have to be sincere in your feelings. And fear is one of those, sometimes; doubt is one of those; jealousy, anger - all your emotions are not going to be considered the strong emotions; all of them are not going to be love, happiness, joy.": "Common",
  "At the end of the day, you are in control of your own happiness. Life is going to happen whether you overthink it, overstress it or not. Just experience life and be happy along the way. You can't control everything in your life, but you can control your happiness.": "Holly",

  "More compassionate mind, more sense of concern for other's well-being, is source of happiness.": "Dalai",

  "All rationalism tends to minimalise the value and the importance of life and to decrease the sum total of human happiness.": "H.",

  "I didn't grow up vegan or vegetarian. I grew up with junk food!

  "As a bookish child in Calcutta, I used to thrill to the adventures of bad girls whose pursuit of happiness swept them outside the bounds of social decency.

  "The necessary thing for anyone to be happy and contented as long as he lives is working for the ones who will come after him rather than working for himself...

  "I've learned very, very, very clearly that money does not equal happiness or security, either.": "Damien",
  "I wanted Jesus in 'A.D.' to be very, very, very human - to have those qualities of vulnerability and doubt and pain and sadness and loneliness.

  "Desire is individual. Happiness is common.": "Julian",
  "Only man clogs his happiness with care, destroying what is with thoughts of what may be.": "John",

  "Some of the natural world is appealing, some of it is terrifying, and some of it grosses us out. Modern people don't want to be dropped naked into a swamp. We want to tour Yosemite with our water bottles and G.P.S. devices. The natural world is a source of happiness and fulfillment, but only when prescribed in the right doses.": "Paul",
  "The word 'happiness' always bothered me, partly because it was scientifically unwieldy and meant a lot of different things to different people, and also because it's subjective.": "Martin",
  "The goal of a life free of dysphoria is a snare and a delusion. A better goal is of good commerce with the world. Authentic happiness, astonishingly, can occur even in the presence of authentic sadness.": "Martin",
  "I'm actually tougher on myself as I get older. It's a vicious cycle. The things that are important in life are the things that you can't buy in life: love, health and happiness. I say that, and I believe that, and I try to live that.": "Criss",

  "I try to be a good daughter, as I believe in karma and feel that how you are with your parents is directly proportionate to what you receive in your life. I am a big oneness follower, and our gurus have told us that if you want to achieve external happiness, you need to be happy internally. And your inner circle is your family.": "Shilpa",

  "I'm happy to sacrifice a big pay cheque for my happiness, if that's not too corny a thing to say. It's probably more naive than mature to say that, maybe, but that's how I feel.": "Jack",
  "I keep mementos from everything I've done. I've got my cab driver's license from 'Happiness.' I've got a pair of glasses and a belt buckle from playing John Lennon. I've got a pair of sunglasses from playing Andy Warhol... It's all in a box in the garage.": "Jared",

  "If someone has children, the first thing they want is for them to be happy, and then become someone in life and all that. But the educational system, I mean always, not just now, creates competitive, successful people, and does not educate them to be happy. The problem is that success gives money, not happiness. The eternal problem.": "Jorge",
  "Liberty is to the collective body, what health is to every individual body. Without health no pleasure can be tasted by man; without liberty, no happiness can be enjoyed by society.": "Henry",

  "I have always been delighted at the prospect of a new day, a fresh try, one more start, with perhaps a bit of magic waiting somewhere behind the morning.": "J.",
  "Makeup is no different than clothes and accessories - it's embellishments for your face. And it also gives you creative freedom. You get to have that moment in front the mirror every morning and give yourself self-love. You're making yourself up beautiful, which is essentially self-love.": "Michelle",
  "I remind myself every morning: Nothing I say this day will teach me anything. So if I'm going to learn, I must do it by listening.": "Larry",
  "I've been saying for a couple of years now that people need to let God out of the Sunday morning box, that He doesn't want to just be with you for an hour or two on Sunday morning and then put back in His box to sit there until you have an emergency, but He wants to invade your Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday.": "Joyce",
  "For the past 33 years, I have looked in the mirror every morning and asked myself: 'If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?' And whenever the answer has been 'No' for too many days in a row, I know I need to change something.": "Steve",
  "You know, I looked at my face in the mirror this morning, and I like being old. My face has more content and when I train in the gym now, I am not training to be strong or handsome - just better than I was yesterday. These days the race is just against myself.": "Jean-Claude",
  "No matter how bad things are, you can at least be happy that you woke up this morning.": "D.",
  "My smile has been my ticket to the world. Smiling releases the same feel-good hormones you get jogging. Caring for your lips and gums is important. I brush my teeth morning and night, alternating toothpaste brands. In addition to flossing, I use a Water Pik to massage my gums and remove food particles.": "Christie",
  "If you get up in the morning and think the future is going to be better, it is a bright day. Otherwise, it's not.": "Elon",
  "You cry and you scream and you stomp your feet and you shout. You say, 'You know what? I'm giving up, I don't care.' And then you go to bed and you wake up and it's a brand new day, and you pick yourself back up again.": "Nicole",

  "On Sunday morning, I'm not nervous... I can't wait to tell what God wants me to say.": "Charles",
  "To find the universal elements enough to find the air and the water exhilarating to be refreshed by a morning walk or an evening saunter... to be thrilled by the stars at night to be elated over a bird's nest or a wildflower in spring - these are some of the rewards of the simple life. ": "John",
  "We never look deeply into the quality of a tree; we never really touch it, feel its solidity, its rough bark, and hear the sound that is part of the tree. Not the sound of wind through the leaves, not the breeze of a morning that flutters the leaves, but its own sound, the sound of the trunk and the silent sound of the roots.": "Jiddu",
  "One morning I shot an elephant in my pajamas. How he got into my pajamas I'll never know.": "Groucho",
  "What's money? A man is a success if he gets up in the morning and goes to bed at night and in between does what he wants to do.": "Bob",
  "It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning.": "Henry",

  "Driving a motorcycle is like flying. All your senses are alive. When I ride through Beverly Hills in the early morning, and all the sprinklers have turned off, the scents that wash over me are just heavenly. Being House is like flying, too. You're free of the gravity of what people think.": "Hugh",
  "I get up every morning and it's going to be a great day. You never know when it's going to be over so I refuse to have a bad day.": "Paul",
  "You've got to get up every morning with determination if you're going to go to bed with satisfaction.": "George",
  "Mom and Dad were married 64 years. And if you wondered what their secret was, you could have asked the local florist - because every day Dad gave Mom a rose, which he put on her bedside table. That's how she found out what happened on the day my father died - she went looking for him because that morning, there was no rose.": "Mitt",
  "I have to be alone very often. I'd be quite happy if I spent from Saturday night until Monday morning alone in my apartment. That's how I refuel.": "Audrey",
  "If I could eat whatever I wanted every day, I would have Domino's pizza with pasta carbonara inside every slice. And at night, I would have Neapolitan ice cream until I felt absolutely toxic. And then I would drift off telling myself, 'It's going to be O.K... It's going to be O.K. you're going to train in the morning.'": "Robert",
  "Morning comes whether you set the alarm or not.": "Ursula",
  "It is a matter of shame that in the morning the birds should be awake earlier than you.": "Abu",

  "On a day when you're tired, it's important to just say good morning to everyone so they're kind of aware that it's gonna be a good day. Jamie Lee Curtis told me that.": "Lindsay",

  "You don't learn style from watching people on a runway. Fashion happens every morning when you wake up.": "Shalom",
  "A human being would certainly not grow to be seventy or eighty years old if this longevity had no meaning for the species. The afternoon of human life must also have a significance of its own and cannot be merely a pitiful appendage to life's morning.": "Carl",

  "It ain't as bad as you think. It will look better in the morning.": "Colin",
  "Love. Fall in love and stay in love. Write only what you love, and love what you write. The key word is love. You have to get up in the morning and write something you love, something to live for.": "Ray",
  "Some mornings, it's just not worth chewing through the leather straps.": "Emo",

  "When I wake up every morning, I smile and say, 'Thank you.' Because out of my window I can see the mountains, then go hiking with my dog and share her bounding joy in the world.": "Carole",

  "I had a very simple, unremarkable and happy life. And I grew up in a very small town. And so my life was made up of, you know, in the morning going to the river to fetch water - no tap water, and no electricity - and, you know, bathing in the river, and then going to school, and playing soccer afterwards.": "Ishmael",
  "In these times you have to be an optimist to open your eyes when you awake in the morning.": "Carl",
  "On a really good day, if I'm really trying, in the morning I'll have a piece of toast, vitamins and nuts, or a bagel with a little cream cheese. Then at lunch time, I'll get me one of those Chinese chicken salads, a glass of juice, and a big glass of water.": "Jo",
  "I'm a very early riser, and I don't like to miss that beautiful early morning light.": "David",
  "Manners is the key thing. Say, for instance, when you're growing up, you're walking down the street, you've got to tell everybody good morning. Everybody. You can't pass one person.": "Usain",
  "Being gritty doesn't mean not showing pain or pretending everything is O.K. In fact, when you look at healthy and successful and giving people, they are extraordinarily meta-cognitive.

  "If you're bored with life - you don't get up every morning with a burning desire to do things - you don't have enough goals.": "Lou",
  "I love Washington. I have an affection for the place. For a satirist, I think it's sort of Disneyland. I mean, you know, there's always some inspiration in the morning's headlines.": "Christopher",
  "When I was in high school, I used to have breakfast with my grandpa every morning. He instilled a lot of values in me: hard work, loyalty. He grew up during the Great Depression in Philly in poverty - he didn't have enough to eat as a kid. Sometimes his family would get kicked out of their apartment because they couldn't pay the rent.": "Matthew",
  "Freedom itself was attacked this morning by a faceless coward, and freedom will be defended.": "George",
  "I'm always thinking about creating. My future starts when I wake up every morning... Every day I find something creative to do with my life.": "Miles",
  "Food is a huge passion of mine, and because I want to eat whatever I want, I run every morning, and then I do weights a few times a week. It's just how I can balance eating pancakes in the morning, a big burger for lunch, and then a fat steak and cheesecake at night.": "Matt",

  "When I was younger I would go to the airport with my friends and drive out 2 A.M., 3 A.M. in the morning and just hang out until sunrise watching planes fly in and fly out. Just sit there and dream about how, one day, that's going to be us in those flights. We're gonna be one of those people with places to go.": "Yuna",

  "A bachelor is a man who comes to work each morning from a different direction.": "Sholom",

  "Even if you don't have time for a big workout, stretching in the morning and night really changes your body.": "Erin",
  "My view is that life is too short. I'm not being melodramatic or anything, but when your mother dies in your arms - just you and her, and it's one o'clock in the morning, and you're waiting for her to exhale - you just think, life's too bloody short to argue about the little things.": "Saffron",
  "Get up tomorrow early in the morning, and earlier than you did today, and do the best that you can. Always stay near me, for tomorrow I will have much to do and more than I ever had, and tomorrow blood will leave my body above the breast.": "Joan",
  "'Good Morning America' exploited Joan Lunden's pregnancy, but you won't see me bringing my babies on the air. The only reason I'm talking about the babies at all is that they've been with me on the show since I became pregnant. After a while, I had to acknowledge this pumpkin tummy.": "Jane",
  "Tackle the difficult things first in the morning make changes in the way you network. Treat everyone with respect and dignity. This stops you from cynicism and negativity. End your day with that same attitude you started. Renew your contract with a day well completed.": "Rick",
  "Some people keep God in a Sunday morning box and say, 'Hey, I did my religious duty.' That's fine, but the scripture says to pray without ceasing. And I think that means all through the day you're talking to God. Even if it's in your thoughts.": "Joel",
  "Most people go to the office and sit at a desk. When firefighters go to the office, we might birth a baby in the morning, save a drowning surfer in the afternoon, and run into a fire at night. What could be more interesting than that?": "Caroline",
  "I want to host a religious show. I'm sure nobody will be wanting the 11 o'clock spot on Sunday morning. I think we should really get some of our own preachers and preach that gay is good. And we'd have a great choir.": "Kate",
  "I'd come to the country to do my Thoreau bit, so I needed an office that looked out onto the woods for inspiration. I converted one of the bedrooms into my workspace and through its windows watched the wildlife appear each morning with the sunrise. Many were the days I would sit in wonder, coffee in hand, for hours.": "David",
  "I love Chinese food, like steamed dim sum, and I can have noodles morning, noon and night, hot or cold. I like food that's very simple on the digestive system - I tend to keep it light. I love Japanese food too - sushi, sashimi and miso soup.": "Shilpa",
  "I come from a coffee-loving family, and you can always tell when my sister and I have been around, because both of us collect all the dead coffee from everyone's morning cup, pour it over ice, and drink it. This is a disgusting habit.": "Laurie",
  "Where I grew up in Vermont, there is no municipal garbage removal. You have to bring your trash to the dump every weekend. Something like three hours on Saturday morning, the entire town goes in. It is actually a very efficient place to do politics. I would go to the garbage dump, get petitions signed, give out literature, talk to voters.": "Robby",
  "Who will tell whether one happy moment of love or the joy of breathing or walking on a bright morning and smelling the fresh air, is not worth all the suffering and effort which life implies.": "Erich",
  "Good morning is a contradiction of terms.": "Jim",
  "A good idea will keep you awake during the morning, but a great idea will keep you awake during the night.": "Marilyn",
  "Do not say, 'It is morning,' and dismiss it with a name of yesterday. See it for the first time as a newborn child that has no name.": "Rabindranath",
  "One of my most vivid memories of the mid-1950s is of crying into a washbasin full of soapy grey baby clothes - there were no washing machines - while my handsome and adored husband was off playing football in the park on Sunday morning with all the delightful young men who had been friends to both of us at Cambridge three years earlier.": "Claire",
  "There's nothing more, nothing better in life to wake up in the morning, look at yourself in the mirror, and feel comfortable with yourself and who you are.": "Caitlyn",
  "I love to start the morning with a mist spray, especially after a night out.": "Lily",
  "We all wake up in the morning wanting to live our lives the way we know we should. But we usually don't, in small ways. That's what makes a character like Batman so fascinating. He plays out our conflicts on a much larger scale.": "Christopher",
  "Maxi dresses are also my best friend. They take me from my morning coffee, to the beach, to nighttime.": "Hilary",
  "I appreciate my brother, His Highness Sheikh Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice-President and Prime Minister of the U.A.E. and Ruler of Dubai, and the Council of Ministers, who face every morning challenges, but plan and remove all obstacles to score achievements.": "Khalifa",
  "Everybody says 'Good Morning' in Harlem because it's true! And that's lovely.": "Marcia",
  "Drink warm water with lemon first thing in the morning. It's a good way to detox and alkalize your body.": "Valentina",
  "If one morning I walked on top of the water across the Potomac River, the headline that afternoon would read: 'President Can't Swim.'": "Lyndon",
  "I get up in the morning, torture a typewriter until it screams, then stop.": "Clarence",
  "Like a morning dream, life becomes more and more bright the longer we live, and the reason of everything appears more clear. What has puzzled us before seems less mysterious, and the crooked paths look straighter as we approach the end.": "Jean",
  "I write in the morning, I walk in the afternoon and I read in the evening. It's a very easy, lovely life.": "Margaret",
  "I don't have to wait until the next morning to regret something I did that was kinda dumb.": "Bobby",
  "I'm very happy with the way I look. I wake up some morning, catch myself in the bathroom mirror, and go, 'hey girl, you're alright'. But on the other hand, I find the website stuff, and the polls, something completely removed from my own personal life. You can't take anything like that too seriously, otherwise you'd end up in the loony bin.": "Cameron",
  "I like to use 'I Can't Believe it's Not Butter' on my toast in the morning, because sometimes when I eat breakfast, I like to be incredulous. How was breakfast? Unbelievable.": "Demetri",
  "I obviously take a lot of pride in what I do on the football field, because that has the ability to influence a lot of people. That puts smiles on people's faces. That gives people a pep in their step on Monday morning when they go back to work.": "Drew",
  "If you want to be an entrepreneur, it's not a job, it's a lifestyle. It defines you. Forget about vacations, about going home at 6 pm - last thing at night you'll send emails, first thing in the morning you'll read emails, and you'll wake up in the middle of the night. But it's hugely rewarding as you're fulfilling something for yourself.": "Niklas",
  "I was a very self-righteous 15-25 year old. Anyway, I wake up every morning and thank God I'm not a kid anymore.": "Annie",
  "I really can't be bothered going to a barber. And shaving every morning, that's nightmarish. I spent my teenage years covered in tiny little bits of toilet paper.": "Alan",
  "For me, training is my meditation, my yoga, hiking, biking all rolled into one. Wake up early in the morning, generally around 4 o'clock, and I'll do my cardio on an empty stomach. Stretch, have a big breakfast, and then I'll go train.": "Dwayne",
  "Never stop moving, or you'll stop moving. I go to dance class every morning, and it's just good to stay strong; I like being healthy.": "Liza",
  "I have fallen in love with granola, in life and at work. I exercise every morning, and then I have a monstrous day in front of me. Granola gives me energy. It's quick, tasty, and healthy.": "Daniel",
  "My grandmother lived to 104 years old, and part of her success was she woke up every morning to a brand new day. She said every morning is a new gift. Her favorite hobby was collecting birthdays.": "George",
  "I wake up every morning in a house that was built by slaves, and I watch my daughters - two beautiful, intelligent black young women - playing with their dogs on the White House lawn. And because of Hillary Clinton, my daughters, and all our sons and daughters, now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.": "Michelle",
  "The bed is a bundle of paradoxes: we go to it with reluctance, yet we quit it with regret; we make up our minds every night to leave it early, but we make up our bodies every morning to keep it late.": "Ogden",
  "I've had my heart broken, and it's the hardest thing. Everyone says, 'Give it time, you'll feel better in the morning.' But you don't. You feel like it's never, ever going to heal - especially during the first few weeks.": "Mollie",
  "I'm never any good in the morning. It is only after four in the afternoon that I get going.": "Stephen",
  "Tomorrow morning before we depart, I intend to land and see what can be found in the neighborhood.": "Christopher",
  "I'm not a morning person: I can't function until I've had a coffee - or several.": "Alastair",
  "I am a fashion designer. I'm not an environmentalist. When I get up in the morning, number one I'm a mother and a wife, and number two I design clothes. So the main thing I need to do is create, hopefully, exquisitely beautiful, desirable objects for my customer.": "Stella",
  "I stopped smoking. But my personality I still have. I get up in the morning, and not everybody loves me, so if you want to call that a bad habit, there's that.": "Don",
  "I have two bowls of confidence for breakfast each morning.": "Eric",
  "When I woke up this morning my girlfriend asked me, 'Did you sleep good?' I said 'No, I made a few mistakes.'": "Steven",
  "I wake up in the morning thinking about food.": "Guy",
  "I'm obsessed with radio. It's a good start to Sunday morning.": "R.",
  "I don't know, but I always loved that image of a girl putting toenail polish on a guy - her boyfriend, or something like that. Or a guy waking up in the morning and reaching over and putting on his girlfriend's shirt. Like Keith Richards putting on one of Anita Pallenberg's blouses, or Courtney Love putting nail polish on Kurt Cobain.": "Marc",
  "When I wake up on a Sunday morning with a slight hangover, in the gym with no makeup on, that's who Natalie Dormer really is. The girl next door who gets a spot on her forehead occasionally.": "Natalie",
  "There is nothing better than to make it to the College World Series. All of the extra reps in the weight room, all of the early morning practices, and all the hard work spent the entire year makes it worth it.": "Jennie",
  "You know what it's like to wake up in the middle of the night with a vivid dream? And you know that if you don't have a pencil and pad by the bed, it will be completely gone by the next morning. Sometimes it's important to wake up and stop dreaming. When a really great dream shows up, grab it.": "Larry",
  "O sweet, delusive Noon, Which the morning climbs to find, O moment sped too soon, And morning left behind.": "Helen",
  "As I get older, I use less jewelry - necklace or earrings each morning, not both; my clothes are getting more basic - fewer colours and simpler cuts; and my make-up is stripped back to basics.": "Tracy",
  "I have to have coffee in the morning.": "Olivia",
  "I love the big fresh starts, the clean slates like birthdays and new years, but I also really like the idea that we can get up every morning and start over.": "Kristin",
  "Arranging a bowl of flowers in the morning can give a sense of quiet in a crowded day - like writing a poem or saying a prayer.": "Anne",
  "You feel a little older in the morning. By noon I feel about 55.": "Bob",
  "In a real dark night of the soul, it is always three o'clock in the morning, day after day.": "F.",
  "The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star.": "Henry",
  "Each morning sees some task begun, each evening sees it close; Something attempted, something done, has earned a night's repose.": "Henry",
  "Every morning I jump out of bed and step on a landmine. The landmine is me. After the explosion, I spent the rest of the day putting the pieces together.": "Ray",
  "Lose an hour in the morning, and you will spend all day looking for it.": "Richard",
  "Each morning when I awake, I experience again a supreme pleasure - that of being Salvador Dali.": "Salvador",
  "The man with the best job in the country is the vice-president. All he has to do is get up every morning and say, 'How is the president?'": "Will",
  "Burning desire to be or do something gives us staying power - a reason to get up every morning or to pick ourselves up and start in again after a disappointment.": "Marsha",
  "Some mornings you wake up and think, gee I look handsome today. Other days I think, what am I doing in the movies? I wanna go back to Ireland and drive a forklift.": "Liam",
  "Cut your morning devotions into your personal grooming. You would not go out to work with a dirty face. Why start the day with the face of your soul unwashed?": "Robert",
  "When I wake up in the morning, I feel just like any other insecure 24-year-old girl.": "Lady",
  "The key to forming good habits is to make them part of your 'rituals.' I have a morning ritual, afternoon ritual, and Sunday ritual. It's one way to bundle good habits into regular times that you set aside to prepare yourself for the life you want. Rituals help you form habits.": "Lewis",
  "I arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world and a desire to enjoy the world. This makes it hard to plan the day.": "E.",
  "After all those years as a woman hearing 'not thin enough, not pretty enough, not smart enough, not this enough, not that enough,' almost overnight I woke up one morning and thought, 'I'm enough.'": "Anna",
  "A clear cold morning with high wind: we caught in a trap a large gray wolf, and last night obtained in the same way a fox who had for some time infested the neighbourhood of the fort.": "Meriwether",
  "Life is beautiful, what do you think? In the morning I say, 'Ah, I am alive still!' All my friends die already. I am alive. It is fantastic.": "Alejandro",
  "I am grateful every morning I wake up. I've a big family full of kids, who laugh all the time and love each other.": "Kris",
  "By Thursday morning, we'd gotten over the worst of it.": "William",
  "I recently took up ice sculpting. Last night I made an ice cube. This morning I made 12, I was prolific.": "Mitch",
  "You wake up in the morning and you look at your old spoon, and you say to yourself, 'Mick, it's time to get yourself a new spoon.' And you do.": "Mick",
  "One morning, just like 9/11, there's going to be a disaster. I have yet to see the United Nations do anything effective with either Iran or North Korea.": "Newt",
  "I am, in fact, Superman. Every morning I wake up and go into a telephone booth and change my costume, and then go to work.": "Stephen",
  "Like every American, I will never forget where I was on the morning of September 11, 2001. As a member of Congress from Indiana, that day my duties took me to Capitol Hill and to sights and sounds I will never forget.": "Mike",
  "Basically I wake up in the morning and I think everything's going to be great. I'm really kind of optimistic, and I look forward to a new day. I pick up 'The New York Times,' and I look at the front page and realize that once again I'm wrong. I start to fixate on stuff.": "Lewis",
  "My father could be very strict, but very fair. His father was the same. We all respected my grandfather; he was the head of the clan. Every morning, we all had to say good morning and kiss his hand. But not me. I jumped on his lap and bit him.": "Azzedine",
  "Dear Chicago, when I wake up in the morning and see your skyline - the terra cotta of the Wrigley Building, the height of the Willis Tower, the shiny sides of my beloved Trump Tower - I know I'm home. I feel a certain energy walking between your spires, but recognize that what makes you special to me is that my roots are here.": "Bill",
  "I wake up in the morning and my mind starts making sentences, and I have to get rid of them fast - talk them or write them down.": "Ernest",
  "Devon holds a special place in my heart. As a child, I normally went on holiday to Bantham and have lots of happy memories from my time there. I used to catch sand eels in the early morning and go fishing for bass throughout the day. I remember a gull taking my bait.": "Richard",
  "Before training, I eat slow-release energy food, such as porridge or muesli, especially in the morning. Afterwards, I eat protein so my muscles are able to recover, such as a protein bar followed by a meal of chicken and vegetables. I always stay hydrated during workouts by drinking plenty of water throughout.": "Katarina",
  "For me, I've always found people who stand up and spritz themselves all over their clothes very odd. I'm a big bath addict, and I get up in the morning, and I have a big bath. But when I get out, and I'm still hot but fresh out of the bath, that's when I apply scent. I just have it on my bare skin; I never apply it to my clothes.": "Poppy",
  "How like herrings and onions our vices are in the morning after we have committed them.": "Samuel",
  "It seems to me that trying to live without friends is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee. It is a whole lot of trouble, and then not worth much after you get it.": "Zora",
  "My aunt had a season ticket for the Friday afternoon concerts, and I would go down for lessons. My lessons were Saturday morning.": "Robert",
  "I lived at home and I cycled every morning to the railway station to travel by train to Johannesburg followed by a walk to the University, carrying sandwiches for my lunch and returning in the evening the same way.": "Sydney",
  "The apex of my civic pride and personal contentment was reached on the bright September morning when I entered the public school.": "Mary",
  "How can a doctor judge a woman's sanity by merely bidding her good morning and refusing to hear her pleas for release? Even the sick ones know it is useless to say anything, for the answer will be that it is their imagination.": "Nellie",
  "Nowadays, everybody assumes, when they wake up in the morning, if they have a question, it will get answered. Because they have the internet. No matter what the question is, someone will answer their question.": "Jack",
  "I never thought in a million years I'd be that healthy girl who wakes up every morning to exercise. After being called 'cherubic and chubby,' I'm rocking a bikini!": "Kelly",
  "I sit down at my desk pretty early in the morning and write all day until about 4 or 5 p.m.": "Jeannette",
  "If I'm playing in the morning, I'll get some carbs early: porridge with chopped banana. If I'm playing in the afternoon, I'll start with less carbs and have some eggs and fruit for breakfast, then a light lunch about 90 minutes before I play, so I don't feel sluggish or full.": "Rory",
  "I mean, if you have to wake up in the morning to be validated by the editorial page of the New York Times, you got a pretty sorry existence.": "Karl",
  "I really am super lazy and doing long hair, especially mine, is a big pain in the butt. It's filled with cowlicks and kinks and curls and frizz - and it was taking too much time in the morning.": "Ginnifer",
  "My poor vision gives me a soft-focus morning. For the first half hour, I kind of wander through my house, and everything is a blur. I put my contacts in when I'm ready to deal with the world.": "Carrie",
  "It was not enough to come and listen to a great sermon or message every Sunday morning and be confined to those four walls and those four corners. You had to get out and do something.": "John",
  "I remember being at school during morning meeting and looking around at everybody, 350 kids, saying a prayer. We're all very young and no one knows what it means, and I remember feeling strange that people were just repeating words that they didn't understand. I refused to participate. For some reason I always rejected it, but respectfully.": "Sean",
  "In theory, people would pick progression every time over being idle. But if you look at us as a culture, as a people, you would say that if you get up at five o'clock in the morning, eat your breakfast, go to work, make money, pay your bills, you're progressing, when you're still doing what's comfortable.": "Q-Tip",
  "When I was in the hospital they gave me apple juice every morning, even after I told them I didn't like it. I had to get even. One morning, I poured the apple juice into the specimen tube. The nurse held it up and said, 'It's a little cloudy.' I took the tube from her and said, 'Let me run it through again,' and drank it. The nurse fainted.": "Alan",
  "I love the smell of paper in the morning it smells like victory.": "Alan",
  "The first thing I do each morning is get out of bed and give my dog, Audrey, a hug. She's a Jack Russell. I think having an animal is a wonderful thing, particularly dogs. They are great levelers, there's no nonsense with them, and they just want simple affection.": "Donatella",
  "I fall asleep feeling beautiful. Then, in the morning, before I leave the house, I say five things I love about myself, like 'You have really pretty eyes.' That way I can go out into the world with that little bit of extra confidence. It's a feel-good protein shake in my back pocket in case someone messes with me that day.": "Jennifer",
  "You know that feeling when you wake up in the morning and you're excited for the day? That's one of my main goals in life.": "Kirsten",
  "Mobile is a seaport town, and we ate a lot of seafood. We'd go fishing, we'd catch our fish and we'd eat our fish. It was a ritual on Saturday morning for all my family - my grandfather, my brothers, my uncles, my father - to go fishing, and then the ladies of the family would clean the fish and fry them up.": "Billy",
  "I remember there were days when - and this is kind of gross - I would sleep in my uniform to save time in the morning and then get up and go to school... it didn't matter because I didn't have to impress anyone, and I didn't have to look cute in class.": "Stacey",
  "I write for a radio show that, no matter what, will go on the air Saturday at five o'clock central time. You learn to write toward that deadline, to let the adrenaline pick you up on Friday morning and carry you through, to cook up a monologue about Lake Wobegon and get to the theater on time.": "Garrison",
  "I got put out of my church choir because my pastor said, 'We can't have baby sister singing the blues and coming in here and singing on Sunday morning.'": "Merry",
  "People get this very romantic vision of a fashion designer who in one night makes 25 sketches and in the morning throws them on the table and there are a lot of women in white aprons with the pins on the lapel and they start to grab the sketches and... It's not like that.": "Dries",
  "We are ever on the threshold of new journeys and new discoveries. Can you imagine the excitement of the Wright brothers on the morning of that first flight? The anticipation of Jonas Salk as he analyzed the data that demonstrated a way to prevent polio?": "Joseph",
  "My healthiest habit is eating a healthy breakfast every morning. I never miss breakfast. As a busy mom, there will be days when I'm cruisin' along and I'll look at the clock and I haven't eaten lunch. And I'll run downstairs, and I'll start shovelin' stuff down the pie hole, and I'll think, 'That was no lunch at all.'": "Summer",
  "I keep my perfume in the fridge. If someone sees me in the morning pushing aside the eggs to grab my perfume, it might look a little odd, but it's so refreshing to spray cold fragrance on your skin.": "Becki",
  "I like to be with my children - not just quality time, but quantity time. I like to be there in the morning when they're waking up. I like to practice piano with them. I like to be there at supper. I need them as much as they need me. Working is not as important to me as being a mother is.": "Jane",
  "From early morning to late at night, it's such an interesting life, and I'm healthy and free, and that's not so easy with a family.": "Olav",
  "Just because so many conforming kids wake up every morning asking, 'What is everybody else going to wear today?' doesn't mean that they don't wish it were different. Peer pressure is just that: pressure.": "Jerry",
  "One of my earliest recollections is being woken up at some ungodly hour in the morning by my parents and sat in front of the fairly new black and white television, watching a grainy image of a man in a white suit climbing down a ladder. It was the first moon landing, and I became a sort of spaceman, as many kids were.": "Charles",
  "I don't walk into the lab in the morning thinking, 'I am a woman, and I will carry out an experiment that will conquer the world.' I am a scientist, not male or female. A scientist.": "Ada",
  "Half of the days in 2014, I had to confine my daughter to my home like a prisoner because the air quality in Beijing was so poor. One morning, I saw my daughter banging on the window... The day will come when she asks me, 'Why do you keep me here? What is going to hurt me when I go outside?'": "Chai",
  "There is something about the melody of 'Thunder Road' that just suggests 'new day.' It suggests morning it suggests something opening up.": "Bruce",
  "You don't wake up one morning and say, 'Today is going to be a comedy day.' And the next day, 'Today's going to be a drama day.' Things happen in life that are fun and light, and things happen that are heavier. You just have to move your way through life, and I think 'BoJack' is a good reflection of that.": "Will",
  "When I have supped too heavily of an evening, I drink in the morning a large number of cups of coffee, and that as hot as I can drink it, so that the sweat breaks out on me, and if by so doing I can't restore my body, a whole apothecary's shop couldn't do much, and that is the only thing I have done for years when I have felt a fever.": "Antonie",
  "Sometimes, getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth is the hardest part of the day - it all just hurts.": "Tom",
  "Each morning my characters greet me with misty faces willing, though chilled, to muster for another day's progress through the dazzling quicksand the marsh of blank paper.": "John",
  "Let me tell you, sisters, seeing dried egg on a plate in the morning is a lot dirtier than anything I've had to deal with in politics.": "Ann",
  "It was morning; through the high window I saw the pure, bright blue of the sky as it hovered cheerfully over the long roofs of the neighboring houses. It too seemed full of joy, as if it had special plans, and had put on its finest clothes for the occasion.": "Herman",
  "Stood off and on during the night, determining not to come to anchor till morning, fearing to meet with shoals; continued our course in the morning; and as the island was found to be six or seven leagues distant, and the tide was against us, it was noon when we arrived there.": "Christopher",
  "One morning, about four o'clock, I was driving my car just about as fast as I could. I thought, Why am I out this time of night? I was miserable, and it came to me: I'm falling in love with somebody I have no right to fall in love with.": "June",
  "The school-boy doesn't force himself to learn his vocabularies and rules altogether at night, but knows that be must impress them again in the morning.": "Hermann",
  "In the last year my wife has noticed me struggling to get downstairs on a Sunday morning. I've two young children and football has been so good to me over the years I don't want to spoil it.": "Graeme",
  "I can't stop being in parades. I just love dancing on floats that move really slowly on the city streets in the early morning.": "Chris",
  "I will check the internet for at least an hour every morning scanning worldwide news to do with child abuse. So if you're constantly putting yourself in an environment where you're checking up on social economics or homelessness problems, if you keep yourself aware of it, you don't really have a day off.": "Samantha",
  "I think it's probably best to work out in the morning to get it out of the way. My ultimate top tip is to drag yourself, even if you have to roll yourself out of your bed and in to a sit-up - it's really not that bad once you start.": "Lily",
  "Couldn't start the morning without caffeine.": "Ginnifer",
  "I go jogging for 25 minutes every morning, even if I'm away from home.": "Pierre",
  "I'm not a guy who needs to drink coffee or anything to get myself going in the morning. I wake up, and I'm full of energy.": "Billy",
  "I love the routine. I love getting up in the morning and getting breakfast and packing lunches and doing the school run. Those things are really important to me. Because I think that those small but key moments are crucial for a kid.": "Kate",
  "In the morning, before I leave the house, I say five things I love about myself, like 'You have really pretty eyes.' That way I can go out into the world with that little bit of extra confidence.": "Jennifer",
  "In the morning, I use a Philosophy cleanser and Olay Regenerist Daily 3 Point Treatment Cream, which sinks in well and feels firming. I rarely wear foundation, so cotton wool soaked in warm water is often enough to cleanse at night, but I take off eye make-up with Klorane's cornflower-infused remover.": "Saffron",
  "I am a dichotomy of tastes. I'm big on water, and I do a protein drink in the morning, but then I eat off the kids' menu after that. So, there's only like six foods I like. I like quesadillas. I like hamburgers. I like sushi. I like pizza, PB&J, or breakfast any time of the day.": "Brad",
  "I love waking up to Sunday morning pancakes. The whole process of making them, just out in the kitchen together making pancakes on a Sunday morning; that's an experience every girl should have.": "Ronda",
  "My father played five years for Valence in France's second division. I'd always cry when he would leave for training. Every morning, I'd say, 'Dad, take me with you. Please, please take me with you!'": "Henrikh",
  "I have this fantasy of my older days, painting or sculpting or making things. I have this fantasy of a bike trip to Chile. I have this fantasy of flying into Morocco. But right now, it's about getting the work done and getting home to family. I have an adventure every morning, getting up.": "Brad",
  "I have oatmeal every morning with whole milk, bananas, and cinnamon, and it's just the best thing ever.": "Kourtney",
  "I'm afraid of only two things: being lazy and being cowardly. I get up early in the morning and go to work. I love to write.": "David",
  "I wake up every morning, and I go to ballet class no matter what's going on the night before. That's my priority, and that's what makes me feel sane and not removed from the realities of my world.": "Misty",
  "I wake up every morning at nine and grab for the morning paper. Then I look at the obituary page. If my name is not on it, I get up.": "Benjamin",
  "I feel sorry for people who don't drink. When they wake up in the morning, that's as good as they're going to feel all day.": "Dean",
  "I wake up in the morning and my heart is light, man. It's not heavy. I don't have skeletons in the closet on their way out.": "Drake",
  "Acting is invigorating. But I don't analyse it too much. It's like a dog smelling where it's going to do its toilet in the morning.": "Liam",
  "You lie awake at 3 in the morning thinking of story ideas. You're online at 8 a.m. on a Sunday or midnight on a Wednesday. It's a job that you never push aside.": "James",
  "When you wake up each morning, you can choose to be happy or choose to be sad. Unless some terrible catastrophe has occurred the night before, it is pretty much up to you. Tomorrow morning, when the sun shines through your window, choose to make it a happy day.": "Lynda",
  "Ever since the morning of May 29, 1953, when Tenzing Norgay and I became the first climbers to step onto the summit of Mount Everest, I've been called a great adventurer.": "Edmund",
  "Cardio is a nice way to start the morning, man. Whether you sit on the bike for half an hour or throw on two jumpers and just sweat, it's good to get up, get the body active, put on your headphones, and just pedal away.": "Anthony",
  "There is only one thing that a man really wants to do, all his life; and that is, to find his way to his God, his Morning Star, salute his fellow man, and enjoy the woman who has come the long way with him.": "D.",
  "But to the slave mother New Year's day comes laden with peculiar sorrows. She sits on her cold cabin floor, watching the children who may all be torn from her the next morning; and often does she wish that she and they might die before the day dawns.": "Harriet",
  "I look in the mirror every morning, okay. What is going on here? You know, I just say, 'Look, it's sheer insanity.'": "Si",
  "Do I believe in arbitration? I do. But not in arbitration between the lion and the lamb, in which the lamb is in the morning found inside the lion.": "Samuel",
  "I remember seeing a movie with Jose Ferrer and Rosemary Clooney where they were husband and wife, and they got in bed, and he had on polka-dot pajamas and she had on striped pajamas, and when they got up the next morning he had on the striped pajamas and she had the polka dot pajamas, and that was considered racy at that time!": "Bob",
  "Every day, I wake up and say, 'Good Morning, Jesus.'": "Vanity",
  "God is on my side, and that's all I need. I get up in the morning, I pray to God. I don't pray to the president, the governor, the mayor, no black caucus, no this and that. I pray to God, and that's the end of it.": "Mr.",
  "I get up at 7:30 and work four hours a day. Nine to twelve in the morning, five to six in the evening. Businessmen would achieve better results if they studied human metabolism. No one works well eight hours a day. No one ought to work more than four hours.": "Kurt",
  "With my book 'How to Remodel a Man,' I was on Oprah, Fox News, the Early Show, and Good Morning America. Oprah was the best - an hour long segment. TV is so short; you answer a few questions, and then it's over. It feels like a hit-and-run with a camera.": "Bruce",
  "I am so excited this year getting to play the 85th Anniversary Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. Everyone knows on Thanksgiving morning to get up, turn on the TV and watch the parade, so to be an actual participant is going to be fun and I'm looking forward to it. I am gonna have to put on my deer hunting gear, though, to stay warm!": "Rodney",
  "For me the greatest revenge of all is having a happy adulthood, waking up in my gorgeous turquoise bedroom in the morning beside a person who really inspires me. That's the best revenge a girl-loving girl from the Bible belt could possibly have. And, importantly, it's healthy.": "Beth",
  "What is news? It's hard to quantify. Certainly news has changed completely, and the morning shows are not really designed to bring you the news, except to tell you what happened overnight, and the rest of it is a kind of magazine mentality - a little bit of this, a little bit of that. It's harder to be an educated and informed citizen.": "Harrison",
  "I wake up some mornings and sit and have my coffee and look out at my beautiful garden, and I go, 'Remember how good this is. Because you can lose it.'": "Jim",
  "To simply wake up every morning a better person than when I went to bed.": "Sidney",
  "Sometimes, I sit down to sketch at the unearthly hour of 3 in the morning!": "Nafisa",
  "People feel repressed by their own governments; they feel unfairly treated by the outside world; they wake up in the morning, and who do they see - they see people being shot and killed: all Muslims from Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, Sudan, Darfur.": "Mohamed",
  "I myself spent nine years in an insane asylum and I never had the obsession of suicide, but I know that each conversation with a psychiatrist, every morning at the time of his visit, made me want to hang myself, realizing that I would not be able to cut his throat.": "Antonin",
  "I was a government employee in the morning and a writer in the evening.": "Naguib",
  "My ideal is to wake up in the morning and run around the meadow naked.": "Daryl",
  "There's pros and cons of a big church. Cons is I don't get to know everybody, I don't get to go to their ballgame, I don't get to marry everybody, but the pros are you get all this community, 800 ushers come in to serve, getting there at 7 in the morning on their day off and coming in on Saturday to make all those wafers.": "Joel",
  "This morning's scene is good and fine, Long rain has not harmed the land.": "Du",
  "Leadership is an intense journey into yourself. You can use your own style to get anything done. It's about being self-aware. Every morning, I look in the mirror and say, 'I could have done three things better yesterday.'": "Jeffrey",
  "We could hardly wait to get up in the morning.": "Wilbur",
  "Pretension is a poor joke that you play on yourself. Snap out of it. Recognise your strengths, work on your weaknesses. Real achievement is liking what you see in the mirror every morning.": "Virat",
  "Like normal people, leftists now have to get up in the morning and earn a living, seeing as the fascists have come down so hard on social welfare fraud, and this is the cruel reality. The good old days are gone, and increasingly, leftists are to be found working in ordinary, proper jobs.": "Michael",
  "I really like to have a moment alone at the house, either in the morning or when I come home from work, when I can just zone out at my computer, relax, stare out the window, get into a 'Game of Thrones' episode, go up on my roof, whatever, then go out to dinner.": "Emily",
  "The repose of sleep refreshes only the body. It rarely sets the soul at rest. The repose of the night does not belong to us. It is not the possession of our being. Sleep opens within us an inn for phantoms. In the morning we must sweep out the shadows.": "Gaston",
  "My weakness, that is, my quadriplegia, is my greatest asset because it forces me into the arms of Christ every single morning when I get up.": "Joni",
  "I remember lying on the floor of my room, staring at a black-and-white television for most of the '80s - watching 'Diff'rent Strokes,' 'Facts of Life,' 'Silver Spoons,' Saturday morning cartoons, and 'Murder, She Wrote' while eating an insane amount of Stouffer's French bread pizza. I was sucked into it all.": "Jim",
  "I love the water. Everything about it. Smelling the humidity in the air, seeing the mist rise in the morning, feeling the dew-wet grass on my bare feet. I love watching the fish jump and the geese land. We even have an eagle here that circles every so often.": "Lori",
  "I love Starbucks. Maybe that's a bit sad. But I definitely need my caffeine. It's what gets me out of bed in the morning.": "Nikki",
  "You pray for things and accept the blessings when they come, you know? And it is about how you talk to yourself and what you say morning, noon and night about what you want to happen in your life. Some folks call that creative visualization. Other people call it prayer. But it is about that message that you send out there to yourself.": "Al",
  "If we were to wake up some morning and find that everyone was the same race, creed and color, we would find some other causes for prejudice by noon.": "George",
  "She got the magazine on a Wednesday morning, and on Thursday announced our marriage was over.": "David",
  "Then there is a still higher type of courage - the courage to brave pain, to live with it, to never let others know of it and to still find joy in life; to wake up in the morning with an enthusiasm for the day ahead.": "Howard",
  "Just in terms of allocation of time resources, religion is not very efficient. There's a lot more I could be doing on a Sunday morning.": "Bill",
  "I drink a bucket of white tea in the morning. I read about this tea of the Emperor of China, which is supposedly the tea of eternal youth. It's called Silver Needle. It's unbelievably expensive, but I get it on the Web.": "Antonio",
  "I had a very simple life growing up in the farm country outside of Perugia, and biscotti and warm milk with a tiny bit of coffee were a big part of my morning ritual before walking to school.": "Brunello",
  "I'm a big believer in creating family traditions. Every Tuesday morning, I make a proper eggs breakfast, and we all sit down and eat.": "Ivanka",
  "We went to a small lake, Bass Lake. It was beautiful. It was perfectly still when we got there in the morning. The fog was lifting off the water. It was just magical. And we did catch some fish, 13 fish.": "Jennifer",
  "I never laugh or smile when I am writing. When I come home for lunch after writing all morning, my wife says I look like I just came home from a funeral. This is not bragging. This is an illness.": "Carl",
  "Sunday morning church service is not an enormous priority spending time with other believers is.": "Donald",
  "I learned to love myself, because I sleep with myself every night and I wake up with myself every morning, and if I don't like myself, there's no reason to even live the life.": "Gabourey",
  "This morning I lay in the bathtub thinking how wonderful it would be if I had a dog like Rin Tin Tin. I'd call him Rin Tin Tin too, and I'd take him to school with me, where he could stay in the janitor's room or by the bicycle racks when the weather was good.": "Anne",
  "A household can never appear prosperous without a cow. How auspicious it is to wake up in the morning to the mooing of your own cow!": "Munshi",
  "I love KIND bars. My favorites are coconut and almond and the dark chocolate and sea salt because staying fueled helps keep me from getting sick or injured. Bananas have also made a great comeback in my life. My kids eat them all the time on the go, which has inspired my go-to pre-run morning meal of peanut butter and banana on toast.": "Summer",
  "In the morning, we sliced all the vegetables and layered everything up in a pot with a glass of Riesling. On the way to church, we dropped it off with the baker, who sealed the lid with a strip of dough and put it in his oven for a couple of hours. We picked it up at 12 o'clock and took it home to eat with mustard and salad.": "Jean-Georges",
  "Every morning I get up and look through the Forbes list of the richest people in America. If I'm not there, I go to work.": "Robert",
  "The happiest part of a man's life is what he passes lying awake in bed in the morning.": "Samuel",
  "'The Panorama' is also the last place anywhere in New York where the World Trade Center still stands, whole, as it stood in the early morning of September 11. I can also see the corner where I saw the first tower fall and howled out loud. Seeing the buildings again here is uplifting, healing.": "Jerry",
  "I used to sleep on the floor next to the bed, because I believed that I didn't even deserve a bed to sleep in. And then, one morning, a cockroach crawled onto my leg. I looked at it, and suddenly I awoke from a kind of hypnotic trance in which I had been all my life.": "Byron",
  "Nixon was so crooked that he needed servants to help him screw his pants on every morning.": "Hunter",
  "In 1977, when I became Speaker, I started meeting with TV reporters each morning when I arrived at work. Later in the morning, I would hold a news conference before the House opened. I always told the truth and almost never answered with 'no comment.'": "Thomas",
  "My formula for living is quite simple. I get up in the morning and I go to bed at night. In between, I occupy myself as best I can.": "Cary",
  "Somebody said to me this morning, 'To what do you attribute your longevity?' I don't know. I mean, I couldn't have planned my life out better. By all accounts I should be dead! The abuse I put my body through: the drugs, the alcohol, the lifestyle I've lived the last 30 years!": "Ozzy",
  "You always say 'I'll quit when I start to slide', and then one morning you wake up and realize you've done slid.": "Sugar",
  "I spend my happiest hours in reading Vedantic books. They are to me like the light of the morning, like the pure air of the mountains - so simple, so true, if once understood.": "Max",
  "I think it's been hard for people to understand how Islam can be a good religion, and yet the Islamists are evil. Those of us who have had experience with Islam understand this, just as we understand the difference between snake handlers and people going to church on Sunday morning.": "P.",
  "Every year, August lashes out in volcanic fury, rising with the din of morning traffic, its great metallic wings smashing against the ground, heating the air with ever-increasing intensity.": "Henry",
  "Bagel in the morning is the ultimate breakfast for me they're just good.": "Lee",
  "Almost every morning I write in my journal. I've been keeping it for a long time - I've filled more than 50 books. I write about what's going on in my personal and spiritual life or what's going on at work. It helps me keep things in perspective, especially when things get crazy or I get stressed or we have obstacles.": "Blake",
  "There is no such thing in the world as luck. There never was a man who could go out in the morning and find a purse full of gold in the street to-day, and another to-morrow, and so on, day after day: He may do so once in his life; but so far as mere luck is concerned, he is as liable to lose it as to find it.": "P.",
  "I had a dream that my dad passed away and that Jesus came into the room and he was basically knocking on my door, saying, 'Hey, you need to find out more about me.' So that Sunday morning I ended up going to church, and that's when I got saved.": "Russell",
  "I did not want windows, only skylights. I chose my painting wall as it has the best morning light.": "Ellsworth",
  "I'm not an early bird at all. Ideally, on Saturday morning I'd allow myself a lovely lie-in. 10:45 would be just right.": "Shilpa",
  "Fighting for one's freedom, struggling towards being free, is like struggling to be a poet or a good Christian or a good Jew or a good Muslim or good Zen Buddhist. You work all day long and achieve some kind of level of success by nightfall, go to sleep and wake up the next morning with the job still to be done. So you start all over again.": "Maya",
  "A lot of vets like 'Good Morning Vietnam' - I get great letters from guys.": "Robin",
  "I don't have a trainer. I have what I call 'the poor man's workout and the rich man's diet.' I run for 1 hour every day and do 500 sit-ups and 1000 crunches, and I lift weights at the Y for 28 bucks a month, even if it's 3 in the morning.": "T.",
  "There's something to be said for writing in the morning. At other points in the day, you're a bit more defensive.": "Alex",
  "Early in the morning, it's super tough for me to eat right away, but I still need energy for practice. I try to start out with a protein smoothie, a green juice, or some sort of fruit.": "Venus",
  "I don't wake up in the morning and say, 'Jeez, I feel great today. I think I'll write a song.' I mean, anything is more interesting to me than writing a song. It's like, 'I think I'd like to write a song... No, I guess I better go feed the cat first.' You know what I mean? It's like pulling teeth. I don't enjoy it a bit.": "Jerry",
  "Having to wake up at seven and go take the subway every morning, having to get over there with all these commuters and see every possible face of humanity and realizing that you're just the same as these other people is actually an amazingly positive thing.": "Mike",
  "We wouldn't think of rising in the morning without a face-wash, but we often neglect that purgative cleansing of the Word of the Lord. It wakes us up to our responsibility.": "Jim",
  "I won't speak for the entertainment industry. I speak for Disney. I've seen people in the industry come to work every morning paranoid about what the other person or other company is doing. That means you're spending time and focus on somebody else's business instead of your own.": "Bob",
  "I think about baseball when I wake up in the morning. I think about it all day and I dream about it at night. The only time I don't think about it is when I'm playing it.": "Carl",
  "To be intimate with a married man, when my own father cheated on my mother, is not something I could forgive. I could not look at myself in the morning if I did that. I wouldn't be attracted to a man who would cheat on his wife.": "Angelina",
  "I get up in the morning, have a job to do, go there, come home, be with the family, that's it.": "Amitabh",
  "There are times when you see how ridiculous is this life, how ludicrous it is, you know, leaving your house every morning and being followed by paparazzi.": "Johnny",
  "What's problematic about playing stadiums and driving around in private jets and drinking champagne at 8 o'clock in the morning? What's wrong with that? I haven't got a problem with that. I can't fathom why people would.": "Noel",
  "Thank God every morning when you get up that you have something to do that day, which must be done, whether you like it or not.": "James",
  "I have retired, but if there's anything that would kill me it is to wake up in the morning not knowing what to do.": "Nelson",
  "A real New Yorker likes the sound of a garbage truck in the morning.": "R.",
  "I'm going to the gym six days a week. I'm eating right. Well-balanced diet. I drink a juice smoothie every morning.": "Chumlee",
  "I had a dream of music and art and the big city in which I would get lost, where no one would know me and I wouldn't know anyone, where I would work at some ordinary job, and if one day I got up in the morning and decided I wasn't going to go to work anymore, no one would ask questions.": "Ori",
  "We have to choose every day to be active participants. To wake up in the morning and choose this life and make something of it is an incredible thing. Not many living creatures have that option. We have so many opportunities and options - it's a huge burden, but it's also the most freeing part of our lives.": "Brie",
  "In the morning a man walks with his whole body; in the evening, only with his legs.": "Ralph",
  "It is not time for mirth and laughter, the cold, gray dawn of the morning after.": "George",
  "I love the smell of juice boxes in the morning.": "Robert",
  "About four days a week, I do pretty good at having a morning prayer time. But even at that, it's a rambling sort of thing. What I have learned to do better is to try to keep my mind turned toward God and ear inclined toward God throughout the day, and I think I'm doing better at that, but I've got a long way to go.": "Max",
  "No man knows till he has suffered from the night how sweet and dear to his heart and eye the morning can be.": "Bram",
  "People often say to me, 'I don't know anything about dance.' I say, 'Stop. You got up this morning, and you're walking. You are an expert.'": "Twyla",
  "Above all, this country is our own. Nobody has to get up in the morning and worry what his neighbors think of him. Being a Jew is no problem here.": "Golda",
  "I like to wake up each morning feeling a new man.": "Jean",
  "Always get married in the morning. That way if it doesn't work out, you haven't wasted the whole day.": "Mickey",
  "My mother had morning sickness after I was born.": "Rodney",
  "Homey don't quit. What else are you gonna do? It's like those guys in the cartoon they get up in the morning, check the clock and fight all day and after it's over they check the clock and go home. That's how it goes.": "Chubby",
  "Early One Morning takes time and, I mean, all things like that I felt were very important.": "Anthony",
  "I woke up this morning, and I still don't believe I won the Daytona 500.": "Dale",
  "Do you know how many calories are in butter and cheese and ice cream? Would you get your dog up in the morning for a cup of coffee and a donut?": "Jack",
  "Another very strong image from the first day was giving my initial press conference in the morning - going down and finding out that everything I had said, the essence of what I had said, was wrong.": "William",
  "I had a friend whose family had dinner together. The mother would tuck you in at night and make breakfast in the morning. They even had a spare bike for a friend. It just seemed so amazing to me.": "Moon",
  "We were doing it under the most extraordinary circumstances, but the first out of the tent in the morning would be David Lean. He said to me on the very first day of shooting, Pete, this is the beginning of a great adventure.": "Peter",
  "When a man has been consistently battering his wife, he shouldn't expect a bouquet of roses from her the morning after he promises to stop.": "Joe",
  "Looking in the mirror to check if my tie is straight is a waste of my time. I only look in the mirror once a day, and that's in the morning when I shave.": "Lennart",
  "I just motor through school in the morning and then go skating.": "Ryan",
  "The result was that, if it happened to clear off after a cloudy evening, I frequently arose from my bed at any hour of the night or morning and walked two miles to the observatory to make some observation included in the programme.": "Simon",
  "My wife gets all the money I make. I just get an apple and clean clothes every morning.": "Ray",
  "I wake up every morning and I wish I were dead, and so does Jim.": "Tammy",
  "The boy who expects every morning to open into a new world finds that today is like yesterday, but he believes tomorrow will be different.": "Charles",
  "I've been keeping a diary for thirty-three years and write in it every morning. Most of it's just whining, but every so often there'll be something I can use later: a joke, a description, a quote. It's an invaluable aid when it comes to winning arguments. 'That's not what you said on February 3, 1996,' I'll say to someone.": "David",
  "When I wake up on a Monday morning and I realise I don't have to go and work at the civil service, I really think I've won.": "Paul",
  "I wake up every morning singing 'The Star-Spangled Banner.'": "Terry",
  "Nothing is better than waking up in the morning and being excited to go into work.": "Caprice",
  "My salary situation at 'Morning Joe' wasn't right. I made five attempts to fix it, then realized I'd made the same mistake every time: I apologised for asking.": "Mika",
  "The first thing I think about when I wake up most mornings is the fact that I'm tired. I have been tired for decades. I am tired in the morning and I am tired while becalmed in the slough of the afternoon, and I am tired in the evening, except right when I try to go to sleep.": "Susan",
  "It takes more than driving to become an IndyCar driver. Gone are the days when drivers show up Friday morning and go home Sunday night. We're all integral to our partnerships, commercially, motorsports. We're as much champions in the boardroom as we are on the racetrack.": "Charlie",
  "I put on lip balm first thing in the morning and always use it before I swipe on my red lipstick.": "Heather",
  "At the end of the day, I don't need to work, and I think it's good that I have the drive and willpower to get up and do something in the morning even though I don't need to.": "Petra",
  "I don't feel I fit in with morning television because I'm like a vampire and I like to stay up late.": "Paloma",
  "'FlashForward' was on the outs when I was approached with 'Happy Endings.' I literally got the script on a Friday, and on Saturday morning I met with David Caspe, Jamie Tarses, and the Russo brothers. I took the role on that Saturday, and on Monday I was doing a table read. It all happened very fast, but it was super exciting.": "Zachary",
  "When I go outside in the morning for coffee, I'm not going to spend forty-five minutes getting ready. I just don't care.": "Shenae",
  "Let's be honest: the trappings of investment banking are quite tempting. I do miss it sometimes. And to be honest, there was a time I'd read the 'WSJ' in the morning, and for years I have done that.": "Chetan",
  "What happens is that, you know, on Mondays, at least in the Senate, you know, Monday night we'd have what you'd call a bed-check vote. Just to get, you know, the machinery of the Senate up and running so they can start the committee process; on Tuesday morning, things go. By Thursday, you know, jet fumes, the smell of jet fumes.": "Olympia",
  "When I was a kid, 'Land of the Lost' was my favorite show, just because it was - in the landscape of Saturday morning cartoons - it was so unique. It was a live-action show and kids were in it, these creatures, these Sleestaks and dinosaurs. Every week was a different adventure. I couldn't wait. I loved it so much.": "Will",
  "When you're not a mom, you can get up in the middle of the night, paint, sleep all morning... you can't do that when you have two children!": "Julie",
  "I eat breakfast pretty much 'round the clock - muffins in the morning, scones for lunch, cereal at night - which may be odd but is also oddly satisfying, if only because the choice is my own.": "Caroline",
  "You don't know what a rough crowd is. If all I have to do is go make people laugh, that's nothing. Let me tell you what a tough crowd is. A tough crowd is going to a morning service and you got six people there and you gotta pat your house payment. That's a tough crowd.": "Sam",
  "I cannot always write at the same time, in the same place. I work, travel and have a vigorous family life. If I'm stranded in an airport lobby - I write. If I have to wait in a doctor's office - I write. If I have a morning or evening to myself - I write.": "Carmen",
  "I wake up in the morning and I think about one brand. I don't have enough time to wake up twice and think about two.": "Kevin",
  "I have a lot of energy after 2 A.M. I like to sleep in the morning. I have some problems at the start of the day.": "Valentino",
  "I try to meditate every morning. It relaxes me, clears my mind, and sets my day off on the right foot before things get too manic.": "Elle",
  "I think if I heard someone else talking about their life, describing all the problems I've had, they'd look like they were through. Done. But there's something about me - I'm smiling. Those things are really not bad enough to put me in a slump. I'm smiling with the opportunity to wake up every morning.": "Nas",
  "I'm definitely a morning person. I wake up dead happy, looking forward to having my cereal!": "Nico",
  "My morning begins with trying not to get up before the sun rises. But when I do, it's because my head is too full of words, and I just need to get to my desk and start dumping them into a file. I always wake with sentences pouring into my head.": "Barbara",
  "It's very important to write things down instantly, or you can lose the way you were thinking out a line. I have a rule that if I wake up at 3 in the morning and think of something, I write it down.": "Mary",
  "I juice a lot; I get as much protein as I can, because being a vegan, there isn't much protein. But that's pretty much it. I just drink lots of water, too. I'll have a protein shake as well every morning.": "Travis",
  "I love perfumes. Every morning when my girlfriend and I come down to the courtyard in our block of flats we're assailed by the most delicious scent - jasmine round a doorway. It almost makes me swoon.": "Alan",
  "As a kid in Africa, you were so connected to nature itself because you went farming, watched the moon out at night, observed how the sky was different, and how the birds chanted different songs in the evening and the morning.": "Ishmael",
  "Every morning I tell myself, 'Today has to be productive' - and then something happens that prevents me from writing.": "Italo",
  "I do the 'New York Times' crossword puzzle every morning to keep the old grey matter ticking.": "Carol",
  "Each morning, you dress to become a different woman. Fashion helps.": "Carine",
  "I'm active even on bad days; it's tough to pin me down. People ask me if I'm a morning or night person. I'm an all-the-time person. I like drinking coffee, but I do it with lots of milk because my energy levels are high even without caffeine. You could call me Obelix, except I don't have a belly.": "Bipasha",
  "I like to remind myself that every morning I'm making a choice to live.": "Sebastian",
  "The Marines are like my West Highland Terrier. They get up every morning, they want to dig a hole, and they want to kill something.": "Thomas",
  "I don't really measure success by anything other than if I am happy. That is success to me. Am I happy waking up every morning? And despite the challenges of running my own business, do I look forward to going to work? Absolutely.": "L'Wren",
  "I really woke up one morning and said, you know, 'I haven't seen a good film about the American Revolution. And all the ones I have seen haven't been successful, but I'm going to make a successful one.' Well, I wasn't able to do that.": "Irwin",
  "I'm at the stage in my pregnancy where I don't feel pregnant. You feel very, 'Oh yeah, I'm pregnant,' because you're over the morning sickness and it's not too uncomfortable. It's fun.": "Kelly",
  "Eating-wise, I'm fairly disciplined. I have to be, because if you're not eating correctly, you're not giving your body the fuel it needs. So, I stay away from carbs after the morning, and I eat a lot of protein - fish, chicken, and no red meat.": "Kate",
  "As a kid, I was just led out in the morning to go spend my day with my friends and just run in the woods. And I'd only come home to eat or when I was thirsty.": "Adam",
  "Football ruled my life for years, morning, noon and night.": "Drew",
  "I think the private sector for the most part, the vast majority of employers in America, they wake up in the morning, and they have a bottom line. This is how much they make, this is how much their expenses are; they certainly need to break even just to stay in business, and they need to make a profit in order to survive long-term.": "Marco",
  "When they told me I had cancer - a very rare form called appendiceal cancer - I was shocked. But I went straight into battle mode. Every morning, I'd wake up and have an internal conversation with cancer. 'All right, dude,' I'd tell it, 'go ahead and hit me. But I'm going to hit you back even harder.'": "Stuart",
  "Declining to go to church with my parents in the morning, I would ostentatiously set out for the Monist Society in the afternoon, down an obscure street which it seemed a little improper to be walking on, as everything was closed for Sunday, upstairs through a sort of side entrance over a saloon.": "Susan",
  "I'm a very spontaneous person. If someone aggravates me, I'm going to go after them. I wake up every morning, and I say, 'What bad guys should I go after today?'": "Carl",
  "I write every day. I don't have a writing schedule. I write when I feel like it. Fortunately, I feel like it all the time. I am writing for hours. I do like to write in the morning. I start after breakfast, like 9 o'clock, and I'll write till lunch, about 1. And after lunch, I just have fun.": "Eve",
  "I drink coffee in the morning and a few cups throughout the day. Among coffee's health benefits are lower risk of Parkinson's, Type 2 diabetes, heart disease and dementia.": "David",
  "I have a room dedicated to music and recording. I go there first thing in the morning and just before I go to bed. And it has a window to my street, so I can watch all the crazies walking by.": "Brendon",
  "I do what I do merrily out of curiosity because I want to know how the brain works. That will get me up early in the morning and keep me going all day long.": "John",
  "I tweet early in the morning when I wake up or late at night just to let you know that I have a show or what's on my mind, and that's it. I hate Snapchat and all of that. It's making kids so stupid.": "Tyler,",
  "It's much better to wreak havoc on a show and be a maniac than promote myself. Plugs and anecdotes aren't really in line with my beliefs. Besides, if someone sees me on a morning show and thinks, 'That's not funny; this guy is crazy,' then I don't want them to come to the show anyway.": "T.",
  "I don't get up in the morning and think my mission is to end Britain. I do get up in the morning and think that my mission is to end poverty.": "Douglas",
  "From morning when I wake up until I go to sleep, I am working. I go to bed and I want to switch off, but the brain doesn't switch off.": "Frank",
  "In the morning, my alarm clock is a chorus of lemurs yelling!": "Bindi",
  "I think people have to sharpen their eyes and look. I always feel like a big sponge: I feel like I learn lots of things by osmosis, and I feel that I'm always absorbing. I mean, when people say, 'What is your inspiration?' I could throw up. I mean, I'm inspired by the fact I get up in the morning. And I'm still here.": "Iris",
  "I have a word quota I try to fulfill every day, and I try to do that in the morning and into the afternoon and then go out with friends at night. I love singing and have lessons and enjoy drama, and so I am involved in that.": "Alexandra",
  "I like to exercise in the morning before work. It puts me in a good mood, which makes my coworkers happy, and jump-starts my brain, which makes me happy.": "Betsy",
  "I love waking up in the morning. It makes me feel really excited.": "Jenny",
  "Inspiration can come from anywhere, and a lot of the time, it depends on how you feel when you get up in the morning.": "Tyler",
  "Quite often, while I'm getting up in the morning, I think my warranty is running out on these body parts because it's not working quite the way it used to.": "John",
  "I do not ask for the riches that perish or the fame that fades away like a morning mist.": "Mother",
  "My parents were great at making sure I got out of bed when I needed to play football on a Sunday morning and that I was ready after school to go to training on a Tuesday and Thursday. But it was never forced upon me or rammed down my throat. If it had been, I could have ended up hating sport.": "Greg",
  "Every morning, I wake up and make the most nutrient-dense green smoothie I can.": "Claire",
  "I grew up in Portugal, and people there party 'til 7 or 8 in the morning there.": "Sara",
  "A Sunday morning spent reading the paper together, maybe drinking some mimosas, alone, and talking until noon. That would be pretty amazing. Married couples with kids will understand.": "Dierks",
  "I don't need an alarm clock to wake up in the morning. Akshay snores so loudly that I'm usually awake the entire night!": "Twinkle",
  "I love morning television because it's the most vulnerable time of day, when you are at your rawest, and if I have the ability to make viewers smile, that's a gift from God.": "Tamron",
  "Even though I hated doing farming and wanted to just get out of the village, I would work from 5 in the morning till 5 in the evening.": "Nawazuddin",
  "I know that I need my coffee in the morning, and I don't want to talk to anybody at the start of my day!": "Tituss",
  "With my book 'How to Remodel a Man,' I was on 'Oprah,' 'Fox News,' 'The Early Show,' and 'Good Morning America.' 'Oprah' was the best - an hour long segment. TV is so short, you answer a few questions, and then it's over. It feels like a hit-and-run with a camera.": "W.",
  "I breakfast when I get up, lunch when I get the chance. If I never get it, I forget it. Sometimes I dine at seven, sometimes at midnight, sometimes not at all; and I never get to bed until four or five in the morning. Everything depends on the news; the hours make no difference to me.": "Joseph",
  "It's a job. I entertain my readers. I get up in the morning, and I start typing.": "Clive",
  "I like to eat yogurt in the morning. It's easy and quick and available anywhere.": "Maud",
  "Make sure you never, never argue at night. You just lose a good night's sleep, and you can't settle anything until morning anyway.": "Rose",
  "The results of this survey are shocking and should be a wake-up call to men and women that drinking and smoking too much not only gives you a bad headache in the morning but can affect your ability to start a family.": "Ann",
  "When I wrote the song, I had the sea near Bombay in mind. We stayed at a hotel by the sea, and the fishermen come up at five in the morning and they were all chanting. And we went on the beach and we got chased by a mad dog - big as a donkey.": "Ray",
  "But I try to steal other moments. Sometimes I get up very early in the morning and enjoy a quiet house and cup of tea before the craziness begins. Other times, I'll take a quick walk on the beach. You can find peace in a few minutes.": "Cindy",
  "I don't want to clip on the armour every morning. I've seen some politicians do this and they get a bit mangled and bitter. I just refuse to do that. I refuse to be angry or bitter or complain, and I remain open. I may sometimes be a bit too open but I'm not going to change that one bit.": "Nick",
  "Most songs have meager beginnings. You wake up in the morning, you throw on your suspenders, and you subvocalize and just think. They seem to form like calcium. I can't think of a story right off the bat that was that interesting. I write things on the back of my hand, usually, and sing into a tape recorder.": "Tom",
  "When I first broke through, there was only NBC, CBS and ABC, and they had news in the morning and in the evening - there wasn't no 24-hour news.": "Dick",
  "I start off my morning with an Acai berry smoothie. I blend the Acai berries with kefir, blueberries, protein powder and peanut butter. I like this first thing in the morning because it's light on my stomach.": "Charity",
  "I always was an early-morning or late-night writer. Early morning was my favorite; late night was because you had a deadline. And at four in the morning, you make up some of your most absurd jokes.": "Joss",
  "Money is a good thing, but every morning you have to get up with something no one else in the world gets up with - that's that image. That face you see in the mirror, you got to love it, and you better do some things that you feel good about inside of you. Of course, money is going to come, but make certain that you do some good with it.": "George",
  "I'm a humanist. I always believed, even with Cirque du Soliel, that this is my way to contribute to a better world. I believe I'm very privileged, but many people face the reality when they wake up in the morning of not having food or a glass of water. Life's been good to me, and I believe you have to feed the circle of life.": "Guy",
  "I feel like going to class every morning is so humbling. You're always working to improve, and you're always being critiqued on your next performance. It's not about what you've done. There's always room to grow.": "Misty",
  "Believe it or not, I say my prayers in the morning and in the evening.": "Jejomar",
  "I wake up in the morning with a list of problems, and I go solve them.": "Travis",
  "At the risk of sounding pedestrian, I'll be completely honest: the first thing I do in the morning is check Google News, partially because it seems sort of random and unbiased and partially because I tend to stay in hotels that don't necessarily have the fastest Internet connections.": "Moby",
  "I'm doing everything in my power to be a great mother. I wish I could be with her throughout the day, because I'm always working, but I make sure that whether it's the morning or nighttime, I make it extra special.": "Christina",
  "I haven't any formal schedule, but I love to write in the morning, before breakfast. Sometimes the writing goes so smoothly that I don't take a break for many hours - and consequently have breakfast at two or three in the afternoon on good days.": "Joyce",
  "I guess I was the class clown - with a name like Albert Einstein, you don't hide in the back. I'd read the school bulletin to the class, and I'd add activities and make stuff up. It was good, a good 10 minutes every morning.": "Albert",
  "Keri Russell is one of the prettiest girls I've ever seen in my life. She's one of those girls that doesn't have that thing when you walk into the trailer in the morning, and your face is all bashed in - like a lot of actors, even the beautiful and handsome ones.": "Jennifer",
  "I'm a really heavy sleeper. When I wake up I'm a terrible morning person.": "Flume",
  "Being in ballet class, being on the stage, being surrounded by my peers at American Ballet Theater every day, keeps me so humble and grounded. Being in ballet class, I feel, is like this meditation for me every morning.": "Misty",
  "If you ask people where they go when they really need to get work done, very few will respond 'the office.' If they do say the office, they'll include a qualifier such as 'super-early in the morning before anyone gets in,' or 'I stay late at night after everyone's left,' or 'I sneak in on the weekend.'": "Jason",
  "I have a vanilla chai latte every morning, which I usually follow with an oatmeal raisin cookie and eggs for breakfast.": "Dylan",
  "I thought it must be desperate to be old. To wake up in the morning and remember that you were ancient - and so behave that way. I thought old people were full of aches and pains and horrible illnesses.": "Maeve",
  "Animation is a great way to work. No early morning call times, no make-up chair. In live action, you're always fighting the clock; the sun is always going down too soon.": "John",
  "In one week, I went from being a girl who owed a guy thousands of dollars - my manager Anthony was paying for my outfits, paying for my food; I was sleeping in his parents' basement - to taking meetings with every major label in America. The next morning, I had a record deal and wrote him a cheque to pay back all that money.": "Halsey",
  "It's still scary every time I go back to the past. Each morning, my heart catches. When I get there, I remember how the light was, where the draft was coming from, what odors were in the air. When I write, I get all the weeping out.": "Maya",
  "I keep a hotel room in my town, although I have a large house. And I go there at about 5:30 in the morning, and I start working. And I don't allow anybody to come in that room. I work on yellow pads and with ballpoint pens. I keep a Bible, a thesaurus, a dictionary, and a bottle of sherry. I stay there until midday.": "Maya",
  "I look upon death to be as necessary to our constitution as sleep. We shall rise refreshed in the morning.": "Benjamin",
  "I have a great deal of company in the house, especially in the morning when nobody calls.": "Henry",
  "All men are children, and of one family. The same tale sends them all to bed, and wakes them in the morning.": "Henry",
  "And this President wakes up every morning, looks out across America and is proud to announce, 'It could be worse.' It could be worse? Is that what it means to be an American? It could be worse? Of course not. What defines us as Americans is our unwavering conviction that we know it must be better.": "Mitt",
  "I'm always afraid of failing. I have to quiet that fear if I'm going to get up in the morning.": "Taylor",
  "First thing I do in the morning, after I have my breakfast and do my spiritual work, is put on my makeup and fix my hair, and I can do my makeup in 15 minutes.": "Dolly",
  "I've always prided myself on my discipline as a writer. I do it like a job. I get up in the morning and go to my desk.": "Salman",
  "Whether it's eight o'clock in the morning or eight o'clock at night, I always try to greet others before they have a chance to speak to me.": "Zig",
  "When they set off for their first day at their new school, I will never forget that winter morning as I watched our girls, just 7 and 10 years old, pile into those black SUVs with all those big men with guns.": "Michelle",
  "Our families should gather for family prayer morning and night.": "Joseph",
  "Oprah's got good politics, she's got a good heart, and she'll have us all up Jazzercising at six in the morning. This cannot be a bad thing, and reading a book while we're Jazzercising. So America would be better off if Oprah were president.": "Michael",
  "Republicans are relentless and they're smart, too - they're not all dumb - and on Election Day, they'll be up at five in the morning.": "Michael",
  "I work to Glenn Gould in the morning and go to sleep listening to Parsifal.": "Patti",
  "I think of myself as a mum who finds the time to go to work. I have to check myself for baby sick before I walk out of the house in the morning. I am really a mum... I know I am a great mother.": "Kate",
  "I get up extremely early in the morning.": "Kate",
  "Braising eggs in a flavoursome, aromatic sauce is all the rage. It is warming and comforting, ideal for the morning when you are not normally up for a great culinary challenge.": "Yotam",
  "Way back when I was a junior pastry chef, I'd bake loads of muffins every morning, as many as 120 or so, while operating on autopilot.": "Yotam",
  "I created 'America's Next Top Model' one-hundred percent. I was in my kitchen making tea one morning, and I looked out the window, and the idea popped into my head. I wanted it to be 'American Idol' meets 'Ford Supermodel of the Year' meets 'The Real World.'": "Tyra",
  "I tweet in the morning and the evening. To write 12 hours a day, there is a moment when you're really tired. It's my relaxing time.": "Paulo",
  "It is very wrong to sleep in your make-up, but when you wake up the next morning, I think it looks very good.": "Carine",
  "Each morning I do my ballet class for one hour; after that, it means one hour less to get ready.": "Carine",
  "You know, I always was an early morning or late night writer. Early morning was my favorite; late night was because you had a deadline. And at four in the morning you make up some of your most absurd jokes.": "Joss",
  "There is a shop close to where I live, outside which, on certain nights of the month - I've no idea if the transit of the moon determines precisely when - fans of designer skateboards queue from early evening in order - well in order, I presume - to be among the first to jump on a skateboard when the shop opens in the morning.": "Howard",
  "I'm not really out in the world all that much. I mean, I live with no phone signal, in the hills surrounded by trees, and I have, like, a mom and two baby deer that come by all the time, and my dogs and the squirrels are in a full-on feud every morning.": "Brie",
  "The great fun in my life has been getting up every morning and rushing to the typewriter because some new idea has hit me.": "Ray",
  "I have my Lucky Charms in the morning, and I feel magical.": "Tracy",
  "My dad used to have an expression - 'It is the lucky person who gets up in the morning, puts both feet on the floor, knows what they are about to do, and thinks it still matters.'": "Joe",
  "My mornings are really about being with my children, so I tend to lay out my outfit the night before when my children are asleep so I can have a quick turnaround time in the morning.": "Ivanka",
  "I listen to music - Lady Gaga, Kanye, Jay-Z, the Beatles, Robert Plant - while I'm walking down Fifth Avenue to my office in the Trump Tower early each morning.": "Ivanka",
  "I want my children to see me first every morning, so I wake up at 5 and make sure to shower and exercise before they get up.": "Ivanka",
  "I, of course, meditate for two hours every morning. It's part of my schedule; I wake up at 4 a.m. every day and I love it.": "Deepak",
  "And if I had a preference, it would be to be able to not be in the studio until 4 in the morning.": "Alanis",
  "I went to visit Alcatraz years ago when I was on tour with the Pistols, and I really liked the atmosphere of the place. I genuinely, really, thoroughly enjoyed the whole morning there. I just liked the quietness and stillness of what is basically a cruel prison complex. I still found some kind of joy in that. That's how I am.": "John",
  "I'm very detail oriented. Everything that takes a lot of dedication and creativity I do in the morning when there is light and I'm really concentrated.": "Christian",
  "Fruit in the morning is such a big joy for me. I like to grab fruit from the tree, et cetera. I don't feel that way with vegetables. Fruit, you can eat it at any time, any moment, in any type of situation. I like everything about fruit; I like the color.": "Christian",
  "People will come up to me and try and be secretive and say, 'Can you do the Gollum voice for me?' And I'm like, 'Are you kidding? It's 8:30 in the morning on the Victoria Line.'": "Andy",
  "Having children is fab. They keep me young and make me get up in the morning.": "Jo",
  "After the first day of practice, there's not one guy who's playing at 100 percent or who feels great. Sometimes, getting up in the morning and brushing your teeth is the hardest part of the day - it just hurts.": "Tom",
  "I think I'm a fun flatmate. I'm always cheerful. I go on tour with my band so it's 12 people on one bus and I feel like I'm the one who's happy in the morning. I'm not a chaotic person, but I might slack off on doing the dishes from time to time.": "Zooey",
  "My mother says I was two-and-a-half when I started playing. My father was a minister, and when he went to church in the morning, she would put on Fats Waller, Billie Holiday, Nat King Cole and Cole Porter records. I'd crawl up on the piano stool, sit on a phone book and play.": "Tori",
  "Every morning, I crawl out of bed. I sit there and think, 'Do I really need this?' And I drag myself to the gym in my garage. It's not fun. I hate it. I work out alone. Weights.": "Sylvester",

  "In the morning, I practice 15 minutes of yoga.": "Vivienne",
  "I don't care if you get up in the morning and don't wash, don't put any make-up on, don't do your hair, even, but you have to have clothes if you want to look different.": "Vivienne",
  "What inspires you, what excites you when you wake up in the morning?": "Jennifer",
  "I love to do three easy things in the morning: I'll wash my face, I usually tone it, and then I'll put a little bit of moisturizer on it - not tons, because I have really oily skin. I don't have specific products I'm obsessed with; I just try different things. That's how I've always been.": "Selena",
  "I sometimes forget to have breakfast in the morning, but when I actually buy a box of cereal, I will probably eat it not only for breakfast but also as a snack later on.": "Ryan",
  "Do you know that I was the anchor on the 'CBS Morning Show?' And my newsman was Walter Cronkite.": "Dick",
  "It's more in my nature to be optimistic, I think. I'm one of those people who gets up on the right side of the bed in the morning.": "Dick",
  "Every morning I have something to do, I'm better off. It's bad to get up and not have something to do.": "Dick",
  "Christians need a time and place to sanctify themselves. It's important to take the time, and early in the morning is a wonderful time to do it.": "Monica",
  "I must warn you right here and now that I am a 'wet leftie,' a 'leftist' and also a member of the 'bleeding heart liberal left.' I had no say in it whatsoever. I woke up one morning, and these things were tattooed across my forehead.": "Michael",
  "Almost every morning when I go to the studio to work, I discover a fresh rose in the bud vase on my dressing table... one living and vital thing in a dusty arena of powder and tissue and matches and greasepaint.": "Julie",
  "Even if it wasn't always morning in America during the years of his presidency, Reagan's eagerness to insist that it was tapped into a longing among voters. They didn't want to picture themselves turning down their thermostats and buttoning up their cardigans. They wanted to strut again. Reagan opened his arms and said, 'Walk this way.'": "Nancy",
  "I'm up all night, and then next thing you know, it's the morning, and I'll sleep, like, three hours. I'm a night owl. I'm usually in the studio at night working, and then I get home, I'm on my phone looking at Instagram pictures and buying stuff.": "Christina",
  "Morning Joe was boring. Scarborough is neither eloquent nor funny.": "Alec",
  "I write every morning. From about a quarter to nine to a quarter to one. It might be nine to one, or 8:30 to 12:30.": "Ruth",
  "My typical morning involves some time on the treadmill, but obviously I skip that a lot. Mostly, I wake up, check my email, then get to work on the various interviews and questions and phone calls that come with being an author.": "Karin",
  "When I was a kid, I'd wake up extraordinarily early every morning and turn on the television, scanning for episodes of 'The Jetsons.' For some reason, I loved the notion of a future where there would be flying cars, supercomputers, and most of all, robot maids to take care of the chores.": "Ben",
  "I always tell students that you've got to be practical. You do not need a dream. You need a purpose, something you can wake up to in the morning when the dream is dissipated.": "Twyla",
  "I wake up in the morning, and I go, 'I'm Doctor Who! I'm playing Doctor Who. I'm Doctor Who.'": "Peter",
  "I'm not an employee who goes to the office every morning at the same time. Then, vacations are needed.": "Karl",
  "I had the closest thing I have ever had to an out-of-body experience lying in bed one morning. I turned on the 'Today' programme and item four on the news was: 'The shadow chancellor has ruled himself out of the leadership.' I lay there thinking that's interesting, then I realised it was me.": "George",
  "One thing that I tell people all the time is, 'I'm not going to answer a call from you after nine o'clock at night or before nine o'clock in the morning unless it's an emergency.'": "Brene",
  "During the morning rush hour on March 20, 1995, the Japanese cult Aum Shinrikyo placed packages on five subway trains converging on Tokyo's central station. When punctured, the packages spread vaporized Sarin through the subway cars and then into the stations as the trains pulled in.": "Barton",
  "I always rewrite the very beginning of a novel. I rewrite the beginning as I write the ending, so I may spend part of morning writing the ending, the last 100 pages approximately, and then part of the morning revising the beginning. So the style of the novel has a consistency.": "Joyce",
  "When my brother called to inform me, on the morning of May 22, 2003, that our mother Caroline Oates had died suddenly of a stroke, it was a shock from which, in a way, I have yet to recover.": "Joyce",
  "It was one of those evenings when men feel that truth, goodness and beauty are one. In the morning, when they commit their discovery to paper, when others read it written there, it looks wholly ridiculous.": "Aldous",
  "I'm hugely self-critical in the morning.": "Nick",
  "Every Wednesday, my husband and I have a study group with our friends. I attend church. We try to devote time in the morning, say a prayer.": "Carrie",
  "I've been getting into drinking smoothies in the morning - I like those a lot.": "Gillian",
  "I wake up every morning and I feel like I'm juggling glass balls. I live in Los Angeles, my business is run out of London, and most evenings I'm cuddled up in front of Skype, in my dressing gown, speaking with my studio in London. I travel a lot, my team travel a lot, but I wouldn't have it any other way.": "Victoria",
  "I'm living in Beverly Hills. I'm very, very lucky. I wake up every morning and I recognize that I'm blessed.": "Victoria",
  "Throughout my 20s I spent a lot of time just playing and not really working, but fortunately for me I continued to get just enough work, and have a reason to wake up in the morning. I really empathize with some of my peers who had success in the early years then it dries up, and so there's no reason to get up in the morning.": "Jason",
  "I really empathise with some of my peers who had success in the early years; then it dries up, and so there's no reason to get up in the morning.": "Jason",
  "I run a lot every morning.": "Tom",
  "I always wake up early Saturday morning, and I have a little bit more time, so I go to the gym.": "Ehud",
  "I am focused on what needs to be done for the people of Israel. Period. I do not pity myself and I do not pat myself on the shoulder. I get up in the morning full of energy to fulfill my mission.": "Ehud",

  "To wake up in the morning and just know what I'm going to wear, it helps me get out of the house faster.": "Theophilus",
  "People are always looking at their phones and computer. It's the first place people turn in the morning and where everyone's keeping in touch and getting their news.": "Theophilus",
  "I have so many things to work on, and so many ways that I fail. But that's what grace is all about. And I constantly wake up every morning trying to get better, trying to improve, trying to walk closer to God.": "Tim",
  "It was huge to read the Proverbs of the day every morning, it was huge to read the Psalm of the day every morning and to get that in us and get us going before the day even started.": "Tim",
  "I wish I had thrown out the bathroom scale at age 16. Weighing yourself every morning is like waking up and asking Dick Cheney to validate your sense of inner worth.": "Anne",
  "I'm not a morning person.": "Christy",
  "I usually run in the morning and like to have something substantial but light to eat before and after. My go-to choices are either a banana with almond butter or a smoothie.": "Christy",
  "I do have a responsibility, but I would make the most boring films in the world if I woke up every morning worrying about my social responsibility.": "Sydney",
  "I usually get up between 7 A.M. and 8 A.M., have coffee, and go right to work. It's really important not to get sidetracked in the morning so I'm still in that dreamy state for my writing.": "Rachel",
  "I've had some pretty awful jobs that I don't miss, like working on a nightclub door, or compiling VIP lists at 3 A.M. in the morning, but sometimes it's just got to be done.": "Luke",
  "I love Michelle Williams. I think she's extraordinary. I was such a fan of 'Blue Valentine,' and I heard stories about how Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams worked on that. They lived together for a period of time as rehearsal. From nine in the morning to five at night, living in a space together. The work is really awe-inspiring.": "Mahershala",
  "I've just finished my 20th book this past year and I'm working on my 21st book about the Middle East right now that I'll finish this year. And I get up early in the morning and when I get tired of the computer and tired of doing research, I walk 20 steps out to my woodshop and I either build furniture or paint paintings. I'm an artist too.": "Jimmy",
  "I watch 'Morning Joe' occasionally. I used to watch a lot more than I do now, but I watched it, and all of a sudden, there was this love fest, for crying out loud - this inexplicable love fest one morning - for The Donald.": "Michael",
  "We hear the stories every day now: the father who puts on a suit every morning and leaves the house so his daughter doesn't know he lost his job, the recent college grad facing up to the painful reality that the only door that's open to her after four years of study and a pile of debt is her parents'. These are the faces of the Obama economy.": "Mitch",
  "First thing every morning before you arise say out loud, 'I believe,' three times.": "Ovid",
  "And I know this happens because I took economics, and I'd explain it to ya, but I flunked that course. Not my fault. They taught it at 8 o'clock in the morning. And there is absolutely nothing you can learn out of one bloodshot eye.": "Lewis",
  "I have spent my life on the road waking in a pleasant, or not so pleasant hotel, and setting off every morning after breakfast hoping to discover something new and repeatable, something worth writing about.": "Paul",
  "Many Africans are used to a life where they get up in the morning and don't know what they're going to do that day.": "Mo",
  "You wrestle one night, get up the next morning and fly out to the next city. You try to work out, you try to get some food into you and, lo and behold, you have to go work again. You are living out of a suitcase.": "Bill",
  "It took a while to learn to eat healthy on road. It's really hard. Really, really hard. But on the bus, I can use the stovetop in the morning to make a veggie scramble. And have lots and lots and lots of coffee. I try to have protein for dinner so I have energy for the show.": "Kelsea",
  "As mayor, I got used to the fact that when you walked out of the house in the morning to pick up the newspaper in your boxers, there could be a camera there.": "Martin",
  "It's a privilege to serve the poor, to be servants of noble Africans, but I better belong in the rehearsal room or in the studio with my band. That's where I want to be and I still wake up in the morning with melodies in my head.": "Bono",
  "John F. Kennedy went to bed at 3:30 in the morning on November 9, 1960, uncertain whether he had defeated Richard Nixon for the presidency. He thought he had won, but six states hung in the balance, and after months of exhaustive campaigning, he was too tired to stay awake any longer.": "Robert",
  "I would like to know that when I read the paper in the morning, it's telling me something that actually happened, and I think the vast majority of journalists want the same thing.": "Alan",

  "Morning is the best time to see movies.": "Christopher",
  "Make no mistake: Bob Ritchie's up early in the morning taking pictures of his son on the first day of his senior year. Kid Rock is passed out in a hotel room somewhere with four scantily-clad women.": "Kid",
  "Disappointing cakes have often been sitting out too long. They should last just long enough to have the last pieces the next morning with coffee - who doesn't love cake with coffee?": "Tom",
  "I do heavy weights in the morning for about an hour, and then I do 45 minutes of higher-volume lifting in the afternoon. My least favorite is the legs... I do quite a few chin-ups and rows. I do mostly old-school lifting with a lot of squats.": "Hugh",
  "I was surprised that everyone calls it 'morning sickness,' because it lasted all day. For me, it was even worse at night. During my first two pregnancies, I felt so nauseous all day that I could only eat plain toast and bland foods - no proteins.": "Kourtney",
  "One of my favorite things to do is go running early in the morning when everyone in my house is still sleeping. I throw on my iPod, and it's, like, my time.": "Kourtney",
  "There's a perception that police are less likely to do the marginal additional policing that suppresses crime: the getting out of your car at 2 in the morning and saying to a group of guys, 'What are you doing here?'": "James",
  "Lives are saved when those potential killers are confronted by a police officer, a strong police presence and actual, honest-to-goodness, up-close 'What are you guys doing on this corner at 1 o'clock in the morning' policing. We need to be careful it doesn't drift away from us in the age of viral videos, or there will be profound consequences.": "James",
  "The attorney general called and asked me if I was willing to be interviewed for FBI director. And the truth is I told him I didn't think so, that I thought it was too much for my family. But that I would sleep on it and call him back in the morning. And so I went to bed that night convinced I was going to call him back and say no.": "James",
  "Our friend, Timothy J. Russert, was a man who awoke every morning as if he had just won the lottery the day before. He was determined to take full advantage of his good fortune that he couldn't quite believe and share it with everyone around him.": "Tom",
  "I am one of the great wasters of time. I have made it an art form. I can get up at 8 o'clock in the morning, be out of the house by 8:30 and back by 5 P.M., and I'll be going all day long and accomplish absolutely nothing. It's an amazing talent.": "Bob",
  "Every day, getting up early in the morning before much traffic, my wife takes me 10 miles from home, drops me off, and I have to get back.": "George",
  "I think that 'Fox & Friends' audience is going to increase. That franchise in the morning is very important to any television operation because they make money.": "Roger",
  "The idea is to go to bed every night with fewer enemies than you had in the morning.": "David",
  "I was raised in an evangelical Methodist church. Evangelical meant that though you had been baptized and made a member of the church on Sunday morning, you still had to be 'saved' on Sunday night. I wanted to be saved, but I did not think you should fake it.": "Stanley",
  "I draw flowers every day and send them to my friends so they get fresh blooms every morning.": "David",
  "I usually end up making a huge mess every morning when I get dressed. My outfit affects my whole day. I'm always running late, and I'm always trying to make sure I feel really good in what I'm wearing, because if you're wearing something you're not comfortable in, it ruins your day.": "Tavi",
  "What is important is the reliability of my posts being there to greet my fans with a smile or a giggle every morning. That's how we keep on growing.": "George",
  "What's the first thing I do when I wake up in the morning? Wish I hadn't.": "Morrissey",
  "I had been obsessed with insects and creepy-crawlies: I used to get up at five o'clock in the morning and go out into this field behind our garden and collect insects before everyone else got up, and suddenly, all I wanted to know about was music. It just seemed a very, very strange thing.": "George",
  "Each of our children during their high school years went to 'early morning seminary' - scripture study classes that met in the home of a church member every school day morning from 6:30 until 7:15.": "Clayton",
  "I love my life as a missionary, keeping myself on the front lines. The image in my mind is that God, my general, stands at the door when I go out every morning; and, knowing what the war is like, day after day he gives me his most powerful weapon: his Spirit. For this I am grateful.": "Clayton",
  "'Longmire' is an incredibly hard shooting schedule because the locations are usually an hour away every morning, and I come home every weekend. I fly back to L.A. for about 26 hours a weekend, just to touch base back at home. It's a lot of work. It's four really intense months.": "Katee",
  "I see myself at 7:30 in the morning and it's not too pretty.": "Rod",
  "In the morning, I always use a cube of ice on my face - it gives me a natural lift.": "Irina",
  "If you want to eat chocolate or cakes, you have to eat it in the morning, for breakfast or lunch - don't eat it in the night.": "Irina",
  "Try not to eat after 7 P.M. Try to stay away from heavy food in the night, like hamburgers and chicken nuggets. Eat that stuff in the morning or early afternoon.": "Irina",
  "I hate morning workout I'm a night person more. But it's good to work out in the mornings because then you can have all day free.": "Irina",
  "It's tough waking up in the morning and reading derogatory stories about you.": "Gerry",
  "Do you know what absolute happiness is? For me, it is to wake up my kids in the morning - these little pieces of innocence - to wake them and find they're so happy to see me! It is unequivocal love, no question about it.": "Michael",
  "NSA is a very conservative culture legally. Our lawyers at NSA were notorious for their conservatism up through the morning of September 11th, 2001. The single most consistent criticism of the NSA legal office by our congressional oversight committee was that our legal office was too conservative.": "Michael",
  "I was an overweight kid, and my father struggled with his weight, too. We would go for a ride on his motorcycle on Sunday morning to get doughnuts, to make pizza together, or go get ice cream. I quickly learned that food equalled love and attention.": "Jillian",
  "I like to read first thing in the morning. I'm addicted to the Kindle. I read a lot of business books, because I feel like I should figure out how to be a real businessman before someone figures out that I'm not one. I really enjoy reading classics as well, which I try to work in once every two months.": "Matt",
  "I do my best stuff midmorning and superlate at night, from 1 to 5 in the morning. Some people don't need sleep. I actually do need sleep. I just sleep all the time. I'll catch naps in the afternoon, or I'll take a 20-minute snooze in the office - just all the time. Our business is 24 hours. Our guys in Europe come online at midnight.": "Matt",
  "In the morning, I have certain aspirations. One of my goals is to avoid looking at the computer or checking e-mail for at least an hour after I wake up. I also try to avoid alarm clocks as much as possible, because it's just nice to wake up without one.": "Matt",
  "I recommend everyone wakes up in the morning to Bachman Turner Overdrive's 'Taking Care Or Business' - you'll feel better.": "Juliette",
  "I was up late last night yapping about the elections on CNN and up early this morning doing the same thing in my daughter's kindergarten class.": "Tucker",
  "I really enjoy my privacy and being able to walk my son to school every morning and pick him up every afternoon.": "Solange",
  "I like to work in the morning. I like to sometimes go to a place where I'm all alone where I'm not going to get a phone call early that hurts my feelings, because once my feelings are hurt, I'm dead in the water.": "Francis",
  "By working in the morning, I find a sense of peace; it's isolated peace, but I can definitely be in touch with my feelings, and then I just start.": "Francis",
  "I don't hate L.A., but I'm nervous about becoming one of those people who has a ferocious interest in how films did at the box office that weekend and, you know, would want to meet for egg-white omelets in the morning.": "Hugh",
  "As far as I'm concerned, the entire reason for becoming a writer is not having to get up in the morning.": "Neil",
  "I feel like fashion should not happen in the morning.": "Olivia",
  "Sometimes I wake up in the morning and feel like going straight back to bed. But I still have to get up and work, and I still have to take advantage of the chances I've been given in life.": "Estelle",
  "Success, for me, is being able to wake up in the morning and feel like a 12 year old.": "John",
  "As goofy as it sounds, I try to sing in the morning. It's hard both to sing and to maintain a grouchy mood, and it sets a happy tone for everyone - particularly in my case, because I'm tone deaf, and my audience finds my singing a source of great hilarity.": "Gretchen",
  "I was never a comic book guy. I like the movies when I see them, especially the origin stories. I never felt like I could be on the set, at 3 o'clock in the morning, tired, with 10 important decisions to make, and know, intuitively, what the story needs. For me, I'd be copycatting and not inventing. I've never said yes to one.": "Ron",
  "Most of the time I spend when I get up in the morning is trying to figure out what is going to happen.": "Madeleine",
  "I wouldn't say I am the type of girl who craves Doritos, but I definitely love a good cupcake sometimes. Or a croissant in the morning.": "Emily",
  "I have the same skin-care routine morning and night, although I'm not one of those people who always uses the same products. My skin changes with the weather.": "Emily",
  "I work every morning, all morning, sometimes in the afternoons. Then sometimes I hunt in the afternoons - quail, doves, grouse up north - but just to stay alive, because writers die from their lifestyle but also from their lack of movement.": "Jim",
  "When I was 16 and arrived in France, I discovered chocolate mousse. I was crazy about the bread, too. Every morning, I'd go to the bakery and get a fresh croissant. It made me feel very sophisticated.": "Jerry",
  "This may sound surprising for someone who works in Hollywood, but I do not count calories, and I don't even care about weight gain, which I know sounds really bizarre. I listen to my body. I don't just wake up in the morning and cook whatever I eat.": "Nikki",
  "You might have, as a character, 30 pages of dialogue a day if you're what they call a 'front-burner story.' So you go home, you learn your lines for the next day, you get up, you're there at 7 in the morning, you do a quick rehearsal, you're on camera, you might leave, you know, at 7 at night and start the whole thing over again.": "Julianne",
  "I think that when you get dressed in the morning, sometimes you're really making a decision about your behavior for the day. Like if you put on flipflops, you're saying: 'Hope I don't get chased today.' 'Be nice to people in sneakers.'": "Demetri",
  "And my only rule being if when I wake in the morning I'm looking forward to the things that I have to do that day, then I'm on the right track.": "Demetri",
  "I never leave anything until the morning. I put my jumpers, scarves, and shoes out the night before. You never know what is going to happen. You don't want to get stressed.": "Mary",
  "What kind of society have we become when children in a great city cannot rely on mothers or fathers for a bowl of cereal in the morning and a brown bag with a sandwich and apple in it for lunch?": "Pat",
  "I'm not one of those writers I learned about who get up in the morning, put a piece of paper in their typewriter machine and start writing. That I've never understood.": "Wole",
  "When my parents were getting divorced, I just said to myself, 'Go to sleep, and tomorrow you can go skiing.' I cried myself to sleep, and in the morning I was up on the mountain, and I was good.": "Lindsey",
  "I grew up in the middle of everything. I walked the streets alone, I rode the trains alone, I came home at three in the morning alone; that was what I did.": "Alicia",
  "You won't see me in a better mood than 4:00 in the morning on my way to work.": "Christina",
  "I'm always in bed by 11 or 12 and people laugh all the time - they want me to hang out until two in the morning, but n-n-no, I need my nine hours.": "Christina",
  "I like to hit the gym early in the morning. I feel better throughout the day when I get in a workout first thing in the morning.": "Derek",
  "I'm very good at getting up in the morning - so much of my life has been spent on film sets where we start at the crack of dawn.": "Joanna",
  "If you're the village blacksmith and a model T comes along, you better become a mechanic. People's lives are better when they get news online versus having to wait for the morning paper. It's a lot more efficient, a lot more real time, a lot less waste.": "Marc",
  "If I want to get work done, that's usually about 3 in the morning.": "Marc",
  "I surfed Dana Point, San Clemente, and of course Huntington Beach. Every morning, you could find me at the hot water pipe.": "Dick",
  "We really practice music and work really hard. Sometimes we'll leave at six in the morning, and we started at three the day before.": "Trombone",
  "I never do anything that doesn't feel natural to me. I wake up in the morning and I know what to put on - it's my sixth sense, really.": "Poppy",
  "When I'm in the U.K., I have a personal trainer who is wonderful, and she's hard-core and makes sure I get up in the morning and go.": "Poppy",
  "I absolutely love Sisley moisturising cream, which I use every morning; it also provides a great base for make-up, and I adore Laura Mercier tinted moisturiser for an overall finish.": "Poppy",
  "I'm a healthy eater. In the morning, I'll have hot water and lemon, then scrambled eggs. I eat spelt or rye bread, not wheat, and have lots of veg and salad.": "Poppy",
  "We climbed the stairs to the third floor, where Osama bin Laden died early in the morning of May 2, 2011.": "Peter",
  "I spend almost every morning with mail.": "Seamus",
  "In high school, I had a gold 1992 Ford Explorer. It was a gift. I used to have a terrible habit of locking the keys in the car when I used leave the car running to help it start on a cold morning. I think the local locksmith became used to me calling him.": "Ashton",
  "There's nothing in the world more silent than the telephone the morning after everybody pans your play. It won't ring from room service; your mother won't be calling you. If the phone has not rung by 8 in the morning, you're dead.": "David",
  "I would bend over backward to be back on Grey's. Any day, I'll choose lying in bed with Katherine Heigl looking over me over getting thrown against walls by supernatural persons at 5 in the morning.": "Jeffrey",
  "I am a New Yorker, and 7:00 A.M. is a civilized hour to finish the day, not to start it.": "Sonia",
  "You can find me at three in the morning in my living room with a glass of wine and really bad '90s trip hop beats blaring from my headphones.": "Jenny",
  "I go to the gym at five in the morning and then go do a hike.": "RuPaul",
  "My best writing is often early in the morning and, sometimes, while working out.": "Greg",
  "As a child, I had to get up early for school or work. I'd get ready by myself. I'd set my alarm to wake me up very early in the morning, and be off to work, the family driver driving me every morning. I did it alone, my parents never coming in to wake me up.": "Janet",
  "I remember coming to New York in 1974 to do a play here called 'Equis.' And I remember the first morning getting up and walking around the streets, and I thought, 'I'm home.' I felt really at peace here.": "Anthony",
  "I do believe at the end of the night when you're with your family, the character gets hung up on the door like a coat, and is there to be taken on the next morning.": "Liam",
  "'Sunday Morning Coming Down' is probably the most directly autobiographical thing I'd written. In those days, I was living in a slum tenement that was torn down afterwards, but it was $25 a month in a condemned building, and 'Sunday Morning Coming Down' was more or less looking around me and writing about what I was doing.": "Kris",
  "I always write 'Magic Potion' on my perfume bottles so when I use them, it feels magical - I make spells in the morning when I put them on.": "Alexa",
  "Exercising first thing in the morning ensures that you'll have the time for it, and it improves your self-control and energy levels all day long.": "Travis",
  "I wake up at 5:30, 6 in the morning, but don't head into the office right away. I like to hang out with my wife, talk about things, get some coffee, you know.": "Ice",
  "I get up 5:30-6 every morning. I'm in the gym. I run a couple miles.": "Magic",
  "I'm relieved that after all these years of doing atrocity work, I still cry my eyes out every time I read the paper in the morning. It's surprising, actually.": "Samantha",
  "I'm going to marry a Jewish woman because I like the idea of getting up Sunday morning and going to the deli.": "Michael",
  "I've become totally hooked on Cellex-C. It's an anti-ageing serum and is fantastic. I use it morning and evening and even on my hands, where it has faded those dark spots.": "Joan",
  "I always do an all-night horror marathon on Saturdays where we start at seven and go until five in the morning.": "Quentin",
  "It's man's work. My dad was gone at 4:30 in the morning and home at 8 at night, and he worked underground, and the last mine he worked in was 26 inches high in a lot of places. He liked the engineering of it - he liked the moving the earth and being able to extract something and put it back for reclamation. He enjoyed the whole process.": "Chris",
  "We only open a couple of presents on Christmas morning we're all about the stockings - we even get them for the dogs!": "Darcey",
  "A lot of people love to do affirmations first thing in the morning - to keep themselves feeling peppy and positive.": "Karen",
  "It seems every morning I wake up to face a list of 20 things to do, with time only to do 10, and somehow I always wind up squishing in 30.": "Karen",
  "I remember trying to write at 1, 1:30 A.M., and just sort of falling asleep. And I think that was actually a good creative state for weird ideas. I shifted to a morning schedule once I had two kids, and I still found that if I slept badly, I actually had better ideas.": "Whit",
  "I travel pretty frequently, but a few things that are routine are going for a run, getting my green tea in the morning, and checking email... well, all the time!": "Payal",
  "You should wake up in the morning and say, 'What do I want to do today? What's going to make me happy?'": "Payal",
  "I'm a mom - I'm lucky if I get to shower in the morning. Luckily, nail polish stays on my toes. I've been so bad on the upkeep, though.": "Idina",
  "Some people never learn, no matter how much their heads hurt in the morning.": "Doug",
  "Complex tasks are often better handled in the back of our mind, and that's often true of creative tasks - when you have something complex to deal with in writing or research or responding to an email. I'll start working, put it aside, and sometimes I'll wake up the next morning with a solution, or I'll find one when I exercise.": "Adam",
  "I try to sit still for about 15 minutes each morning without making lists or running in overdrive.": "Alex",
  "I woke up one morning with the knowledge that I had a brain tumor. It wasn't so much that I dreamt I had a brain tumor; it was like someone just poured the knowledge into my head. It wasn't like an image; it was just like knowing. It was so weird, which is why I paid attention.": "Mark",
  "There are so many songs in my heart and in my brain. I wake up at 2 in the morning, and I have to get up and sing them. There are so many of them, it's ridiculous.": "Aaron",
  "I get up in the morning. I usually do a radio interview early in the morning. I usually do a book signing, because I'm also a cookbook author, so I'm at some store, at a Walmart or a Williams Sonoma, for three hours, standing up, signing autographs, and taking pictures for three hours.": "Trisha",
  "The reality is that you think you're going to have all this time out here, to do all this stuff, and the truth of the matter is, you just don't. If we're on the road, and we stay in the city we're in, I'm going to try to get up in the morning and get a workout in.": "Trisha",
  "Generally, when I wake up in the morning I set out a series of problems for myself and I write them down, and when I'm sleeping, my mind solves the problems. When I wake up in the morning, I have more clarity on the issue.": "Wynton",
  "People have to learn that everybody is the same. If you wake up in the morning, even if you're a movie star, you look like everybody else. The reality is that makeup is there to help. That's what it's for.": "Francois",
  "I used to get into bed with my mother every morning, almost until she died, and talk about everything. She was my closest confidante always. I had no secrets from her.": "Miriam",
  "My grandmother would start making her meat sauce at 7 in the morning on Sunday, and within five or six hours, that smell would be all through the house.": "Jerry",
  "Every morning when I wake up, I am grateful and happy that I come to the film set. It is home.": "Arjun",
  "I remember when I grew up and Dad would take me to kindergarten in the morning, and you could smell the chips in the air from the factory nearby.": "Jens",
  "I'm big about washing my face before I go to bed, washing it when I wake up in the morning, getting good sleep and drinking a lot of water. Those are just easy things that you can do for your skin.": "Kendall",
  "I do devotion in the morning. I pray and I read the word.": "Andra",
  "If I'm going to have baked goods in the morning, the rule is that I have to make them myself.": "Jenny",
  "Maybe I am a bit unusual here, but I am less stressed if I have my phone with me. Because I can spend like an hour in the morning taking care of everything instead of I sit there and wonder what I missed or wonder what's happening. So it's way less stressful for me to just answer my phone.": "Sam",
  "My morning starts with some form of exercise, and I give two hours - from 5:30 to 7:30 A.M. - to my personal fitness.": "Sushant",
  "When I wake up in the morning, I just go.": "Savion",
  "If yesterday was a good day's work, chances are you'll stay on a roll. And if you can stay on a roll, everything else will probably take care of itself - including not working from the moment you get up in the morning until you nod off to sleep.": "Jason",
  "I like being in movies that have a great story. I'm not so interested in being a Hollywood star. It's a job, you know. When you wake up at six in the morning every day for a week, it feels like hard work.": "Kristen",
  "If I get to a place early in the morning, I try to walk around by myself. I still try to find cool places to go to, like a record store in St. Louis or some restaurant in Chicago.": "Yuna",
  "Until I really dealt with a lot of the demons in my life - the fear and self-doubt and unresolved issues with my old man - I could never feel fulfilled and happy. I would wake up in the morning and feel bad.": "David",
  "Sometimes you will do a close-up for a scene in the morning where you are totally distraught, then shoot the rest of that scene seven hours later. How do you hang on to that feeling all day without burning up, without going so far that you have nothing left to give when the cameras roll again?": "Penelope",
  "I walk my dog every morning.": "Chelsea",
  "At 14, I was the most disciplined guy around. I would get up at 5 o'clock in the morning and run five miles, and then go to school. Sometimes I would run behind the school bus, and the kids thought I was just crazy. I knew what I wanted.": "Sugar",
  "It takes people being alone in front of the computer at three in the morning to write opinions about movies, apparently.": "Jeff",
  "No, ramen's not good for you. But in Japan, our favorite thing to do after drinking all night, especially in Sapporo where it's freezing cold, is to go to the ramen place at two, three in the morning.": "Cary",
  "I get work done in half the time if the family is still asleep. When my family wakes up, I've already had a productive morning and am ready to enjoy breakfast with them before I start conquering the rest of my day.": "John",
  "My marriage to David Bailey ended one morning in 1983, while he was away on a photo-shoot.": "Marie",
  "I'm a firm believer that if you put together a good product that is just good policy, that is embraced by both sides so that it is seen as politically advantageous to the Republicans or Democrats, that even in this very polarized partisan world that you can advance legislation. I have to believe that, or I wouldn't want to get up every morning.": "Lisa",
  "In the morning, I usually get up between 7:40 A.M. and 7:45 A.M., and then I'll brush my teeth, do my hair, and just throw on my leotard and my clothes and go to the kitchen.": "Simone",
  "I think glamour all the time. I wake up in the morning and I'm already thinking glamour.": "Donatella",
  "Every morning, I make myself a cappuccino with a drawing in the foam. I post them to Instagram with the hashtag #christiecappuccino.": "Christie",
  "I like coffee in the morning and decaf green tea throughout the day... When I was younger and modeling, to kick-start a diet I would do a juice cleanse.": "Christie",
  "If we bought everything on the Internet, our eyes and mouths and nostrils would probably begin to film over with a tegument - one initially tissue-thin and capable of being removed each morning, but which gradually thickened and hardened until we were imprisoned in our own tiny minds.": "Will",
  "People get emails from me at 3 in the morning.": "Dylan",
  "I always run in the morning on an empty stomach, and I'll go through a bottle and a half of water. Then I have a protein drink or I eat egg whites.": "Drew",
  "One is a painter because one wants so-called freedom one doesn't want to go to the office every morning.": "Marcel",
  "My father was a Baptist preacher, and he used to read the King James Bible to me every single morning. He made me memorize it and repeat verses at night before I went to sleep.": "Jay",
  "I like to try to do a little work before I do anything in the morning, even if it's a paragraph.": "Sloane",
  "My personality, when tasked with creating meals, goes something like this: Is there a way we can make this more difficult? Because let's do that. I don't mean to complicate things. It's just - why buy pre-packaged potato salad when you can spend your morning boiling potatoes and flipping out because there's no dill in the house?": "Sloane",
  "If you woke up each morning, and immediately dwelt on your ills, what sort of a day could you look forward to?": "Maeve",
  "I try to make films that I find exciting. It makes me want to get out of bed at five in the morning, have my make-up done and play for the rest of the day.": "Kristin",
  "Making films can be absolutely fantastic, but it can also be incredibly dull. You spend the whole day sitting by yourself in your trailer and then you get called to deliver one sentence - then you're told to come back and do it again at 5:30 the following morning.": "Kristin",
  "We're the roughest people in the way we play and live, and that is because Americans come from people who all got up one morning and went 5,000 miles, and that was a time in the 19th century when it wasn't so easy to do.": "Alan",
  "'Morning Joe' host Mika Brzezinski's personal life is a minefield. Her father is Zbigniew Brzezinski, former national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter, and while one brother is an Obama appointee, the other advises Romney.": "Campbell",

  "I can't sleep without the TV on, so we leave it on during the night, and that's what wakes me up - Joe Scarborough and 'Morning Joe' at 7:30 or 8.": "Chrissy",
  "I've been there a thousand years, and I never felt comfortable. Beverly Hills - when I first saw it, I thought they put it up this morning. You got to pack water to get to the drugstore.": "Peter",
  "My father's whole life was work. He had a retail store in Ossining, New York, and I mean, he was down there at 6:15 every morning. The store didn't open until 9, but he hadda be down there. That's all he knew.": "Peter",
  "I don't like getting up in the morning, getting in a car, driving on a freeway, and stopping at a gate where two guards are standing there, then walk into a studio that looks like a bunch of airplane hangars.": "Peter",
  "Obama is the New Generation and the hot light of a dawn that goes way beyond clever talk of morning in America.": "John",
  "I hear that 5 o'clock whistle in my mind like Fred Flintstone and I have to stop. I'm also not much of a morning writer. I have a sweet spot from about 11am to 4pm. But I really work during that time.": "Diablo",
  "You numb yourself so you're not terrified when you're on TV at 7 o'clock in the morning with Justin Bieber, who you just met a couple of days before, having to perform in front of millions of people.": "Halsey",
  "I love stretching in the morning. It's the first thing I do when I wake up because getting a good back-crack is so extremely satiating. I feel taller when I finally stand.": "Rachel",
  "I'm actually one of those people who get up energetic in the morning.": "Elizabeth",
  "I can only tell you that eggs, country ham, biscuits, a pot of coffee, a morning paper, a table by the window overlooking the veranda and putting green, listening to the idle chitchat of competitors, authors, wits and philosophers, hasn't exactly been a torturous way to begin each day at the Masters all these years.": "Dan",
  "I literally have meetings at eight o'clock in the morning, and I finish at nine o'clock at night. It sounds pathetic, but I don't even have time to go shopping.": "Stella",
  "I listen to Ustad Vilayat Khan's 'Raga Khamaj' and 'Raga Jaijaiwanti' virtually every morning, a lot of Abdullah Ibrahim, Michael Kiwanuka, Savages, and contemporary Ugandan pop.": "Mira",
  "I became a musician so I wouldn't have to get up at 6 in the morning.": "Norah",
  "Scorpions like holes. We had to put our arms in the holes to dig out the smelting residues. We always performed critter checks before an excavation, but one morning, I put an arm in and felt a sharp pierce. When I brought my hand out, it was red and already swelling.": "Sarah",
  "It didn't matter what you look like. You don't have to get up at 5:30 in the morning and there's a lot to be said for that. Corpse Bride can just play all my parts from now on and I'll just do the voice.": "Helena",
  "I get up early in the morning, 4 o'clock, and I sit at my desk and what I do is just dream. After three or four hours, that's enough. In the afternoon, I run.": "Haruki",
  "My job starts at a quarter to seven in the morning, and you go right through until whatever time is necessary to finish up.": "Enda",
  "I procrastinate all morning. That's when I get my office work done and answer e-mails and see what's on the Internet and do laundry.": "Kate",
  "Emily Gannett is tireless. I know this because I have traded emails with her at 2 A.M. only to later wake blearily to a chipper morning missive sent south of 6 A.M. before her morning run.": "Rachel",
  "Yeah, I'm not really a morning person.": "Sophie",
  "It's very exciting... what DeAndre brings to the game is truly special. To have the opportunity to play with a football player like that, that's what gets a quarterback out of bed in the morning.": "Brock",
  "Cross the wrong state border with your gun, or wake up one morning to new legislation or a new presidential executive order, and suddenly you're the bad guy, not the good guy. No wonder some gun owners seem so touchy; they feel, at some level, like criminals in waiting.": "Walter",
  "Even if I have already peaked, I have to believe I can improve. I wake up every morning, and go to practice, with the illusion that I'm going to get better that day.": "Rafael",
  "I was passionate about soccer. I still am. Odd, though - playing soccer always made me much more anxious than playing tennis. On soccer days, I'd be out of bed by 6 in the morning, all nervous. But I was always calm when it was time for a tennis match. I still don't know why.": "Rafael",
  "Sometimes I wake up in the morning and I am like, 'This is a high-top day' or 'This is a bob day,' but when I get my clothes on that's when I see.": "Nicki",
  "I never knew a man come to greatness or eminence who lay abed late in the morning.": "Jonathan",
  "I had the perfect job for a gamer. From February to October, I'd get up at 7 in the morning with nothing to do but play games until I had to be at the park around 1 or 2 o'clock. When I got back after the game, I played until 3 or 4 in the morning.": "Curt",
  "Every NASCAR driver watches Formula One in the morning they are well informed.": "Mario",
  "At my wedding, I was dancing so furiously that I fell hard on my kneecaps. The next morning, my knees were so swollen that I had to get a wheelchair at the airport to go on my honeymoon.": "Casey",
  "I only discovered the 'Harry Potter' series in my tenth standard. I dived right into it, often reading non-stop through the day and night. It was the morning after one such readathon when I was to appear for a Chemistry exam. Spending my night with the third edition of Harry Potter didn't help much, and I fared poorly.": "Sonam",
  "I was in Shanghai when the Japanese invaded China. I was there in Shanghai when, the morning after Pearl Harbor, they seized Shanghai.": "J.",
  "We are shallow because our media are so horribly shallow. Every morning, I peruse the papers, and there is so little to read in them. It is the same with radio - all that noise, that artifice.": "F.",
  "I'm not a person who naturally loves to wake up in the morning and go 'Yeah, I'm going to work out for five hours - wooh!' Like, that's not my thing. I'm from Texas. I like to eat carbs. I like to chill out with my friends and do anything but 150 push-ups and sit-ups.": "Jennifer",
  "I'm a late riser by my family's standards. Sleeping is a luxury because since I was young, I woke up very early to go ice-skating. So I'm really not a morning girl.": "Vera",
  "If you do cardio one day and the next day you can do weights, do it that way. If you need to do it at night or in the morning, do it that way. Whatever you need to get it done, just get it done.": "LL",
  "When I was a child I had a nightmare, and in the morning, I asked my mother and father, 'If I kill someone, would you still love me?' My parents were very preoccupied with this, but I think I'm not the only one to ask for that - not love, but absolute fidelity.": "Claire",
  "In these days a man is nobody unless his biography is kept so far posted up that it may be ready for the national breakfast-table on the morning after his demise.": "Anthony",
  "I show up in my writing room at approximately 10 A.M. every morning without fail. Sometimes my muse sees fit to join me there and sometimes she doesn't, but she always knows where I'll be. She doesn't need to go hunting in the taverns or on the beach or drag the boulevard looking for me.": "Tom",
  "Making love in the morning got me through morning sickness. I found I could be happy and throw up at the same time.": "Pamela",
  "I'm the guy that gets up at three in the morning to jot down an entire sheet of lyrics for something that won't be recorded for six months. You have to get it down when you can, because thoughts are fluid.": "Corey",
  "With Saturday morning cartoons, you've got to start at 6 A.M., right?": "Jim",
  "I go to yoga every day. I meditate every morning.": "Russell",
  "Let me tell you, it is still morning in America. It just happens to be kind of a head pounding, hung over for four hours in America - and it's shaping up to be a nasty day, but its still morning in America.": "Glenn",
  "I have an orthopedic pillow that's made out of a sponge material. I have a plate in my throat, and I have to be careful or I could end up with a bad neck in the morning. That pillow is a must everywhere I go.": "Lee",
  "I never think of yesterday. Can't do anything about it. I'm a positive guy. When you really deep down look at it, we go to bed every night, get up every morning, stay here for 70 or 80 years, and then we die.": "Lee",
  "I had a monumental idea this morning, but I didn't like it.": "Samuel",
  "My father-in-law gets up at 5 o'clock in the morning and watches the Discovery Channel. I don't know why there's this big rush to do this.": "Jeff",
  "I generally blog between 5:30 A.M. and 7 A.M. I will from time to time add something during the day, but for the most part blogging is an early morning activity for me.": "Fred",
  "If you read about Mussolini or Stalin or some of these other great monsters of history, they were at it all the time, that they were getting up in the morning very early. They were physically very active. They didn't eat lunch.": "A.",
  "I used to start at about 10 at night and work until early morning. My preferred way to work is to start in the early afternoon and work until about 3, go do errands, have dinner, and then write for a few more hours in the evening.": "Mary",
  "The great secret of doctors, known only to their wives, but still hidden from the public, is that most things get better by themselves; most things, in fact, are better in the morning.": "Lewis",
  "I work all day, morning and afternoon, just about every day. If I sit there like that for two or three years, at the end I have a book.": "Philip",
  "Do I get up every morning and ask: am I doing the things that I believe in and am I doing them for the best possible motives? Yes. Unambiguously yes.": "Nick",
  "I usually decide what to wear in the morning, but sometimes, I'll have a favorite coat or sweater or shoes, and I'll wear them everyday for a week!": "Cameron",
  "When I wake up in the morning, I like to refresh myself and put some tonic on - one with vitamin C - and then an oxygen cream with vitamins A, C, and E. That's very important to me so that my skin will stay moisturized throughout the day.": "Melania",
  "I don't mind traveling that much when I can go somewhere and stay there for a while, but touring is different. You rarely see anything. You get there early in the morning and you're resting all day, and you go in and do a sound check, and you do the show, and then bam you're gone.": "George",
  "It has not been easy to wake up every single day at 6:30 in the morning to then head to the gym and start a full day of work. But you have to have that kind of dedication if you want to achieve the goals you have set for yourself.": "Pablo",
  "When you stand up in the morning, you look in the mirror and say, 'I'm black.' No. You wake up and you see yourself as a human being in the world, but you raise discussion and raise aggression, the anger that you confront every day of your life, whether you want to or not.": "Raoul",
  "I'd always been a news junkie, always read lots of newspapers and watched the Sunday morning news shows on TV and felt strongly about issues of power, control, sexuality and race.": "Barbara",
  "It's always morning for me until 4 in the afternoon.": "Luis",
  "Every little detail of my life is, and has always been, surrounded by fashion - from the cup I drink my coffee from in the morning to my constant travels - fashion always pops up somewhere and somehow.": "Margherita",
  "I would do the morning show and then just walk over to the network side of the building here at ABC in New York and sit down and start it up again and introduce the 10 contestants, and then introduce the 10 - the fastest finger question, and pick one of them, put them in the seat before you finally got to asking them the questions.": "Regis",
  "I keep wondering at night, 'Will I have a bank the next morning, or will some technology company be doing banking without needing a bank?'": "Uday",
  "I can't say for sure where I was headed the first time my mom put a blue blazer on me. Church, probably. West Side Presbyterian in Ridgewood, New Jersey, specifically, where my blazer was paired with a clip-on tie and a pair of khakis for a Sunday morning with my fellow congregants.": "Willie",
  "Landing on 'Morning Joe' wasn't a fluke. I was a poli sci major in college. I interned at the CBS political unit, covered conventions.": "Willie",
  "I'm a morning bird. I love getting up before it's light out if it's possible. I wake up, I have a black coffee. I'm an 86-year-old man. I try to work out first thing to get it over with. When I do it, I feel good because I have the endorphins all day.": "Ellie",
  "Sydney in general is eclectic. You can be on that brilliant blue ocean walk in the morning and then within 20 minutes you can be in a completely vast suburban sprawl or an Italian or Asian suburb, and it's that mix of people, it's that melting pot of people that give it its vital personality.": "Baz",
  "In order to have good fried chicken, you should wash and season the bird the morning you're preparing it for dinner. Don't wait and do it right before you start cooking. Throw it in the refrigerator, seasoned, that morning, and give it a chance to soak up all the salt and pepper and goodness.": "Paula",
  "I am so blessed. I've been way over-blessed. At 64 years old, I look forward to going to bed every night so I can wake up in the morning and see what blessing is going to come my way that day. Because you never, ever know what God's got in store for you.": "Paula",
  "My dad, he worked rebar, an ironworker. Watching my pops get up every single morning, going into work, working hard - I think that really made me want to work that hard, wanted to make me get up early and go for a run or get a lift in or get some extra hitting in and really try to better myself every day.": "Bryce",
  "Whereas I used to get depressed or neurotic or dwell on things, I see my son's bright eyes and smile in the morning, and suddenly, I don't feel like I'm depressed anymore. There's nothing to be depressed about when you've got that.": "Corey",
  "When you're doing a medieval show like 'Pillars,' it starts off a bit like a school play. You're all in funny costumes; you've had your coffee, and you say, 'Good morning'. Then you go on set and, if you've got good actors and directors, it takes on a life of its own.": "Ian",
  "I am a bit obsessive about tidiness. I need to make my bed in the morning and leave it perfectly made up.": "Kiefer",
  "To keep my back from getting stiff, I have a strict regime every morning of stretching and do yoga once a week and Pilates. 'Strictly Come Dancing' in 2008 was great for my fitness.": "Cherie",
  "Those golden minutes before you are completely awake, when your mind is just drifting, you have no censorship; you are ready to develop any kind of idea. That's when I come up with the best and worst ideas. That is the privilege of being a writer - that you can stay in bed for an hour in the morning and it's work time.": "Jo",
  "The time I spend in the morning - praying, sipping coffee, and coming up with my list - is a ritual I relish. I have done it for so long now that I subconsciously measure whether or not the things I'm doing match with what I should be doing, what I want to be doing, and the life I want to live.": "Kristin",
  "The question is the morning after. What sort of Iraq do we wake up to after the bombing? What happens in the region? What impact could it have? These are questions leaders I have spoken to have posed.": "Kofi",
  "Like all Americans, I will never forget where I was the morning of the 9/11 attacks.": "Kirsten",
  "For me, I exercise every morning. I exercise every day. I work out about an hour and 20 minutes, which is aerobics and resistance training. I work on agility and balance. I work on the things that are going to help my condition. I do agility training. I walk on a treadmill. I use an elliptical. I use weights.": "Montel",
  "If you are a girl dressing up in the morning thinking about the whole world having a point of view on what you are wearing, it takes the pleasure out of getting dressed.": "Olivier",
  "The morning is always my best time of the day for writing because that's when my head is best.": "Zoe",
  "What I don't like is breakfast in the morning. I have a double-espresso cappuccino, but no food.": "Wolfgang",
  "I used to wake up in the morning and say, 'Oh, God.' Now I wake up in the morning and look forward to life.": "Steven",
  "I wake up laughing. Yes, I wake up in the morning and there I am just laughing my head off.": "Bruce",
  "When I wake up in the morning, I feel like a billionaire without paying taxes.": "Ernie",
  "I am really passionate about my career and my music and I am so lucky to be able to do what I do for a job, so for all the early morning starts and long days, I could never trade it all in.": "Rachel",
  "I wake up every morning and I surprise myself. I wake up to a new me.": "Gina",
  "A locked-room problem lies at the heart of my new novel, 'In The Morning I'll Be Gone,' in which an RUC detective has to find out whether a publican's daughter who fell off a table in a bar that was locked from the inside was in fact murdered.": "Adrian",
  "'Old times' never come back and I suppose it's just as well. What comes back is a new morning every day in the year, and that's better.": "George",
  "I'll always remember when I bumped into Good Morning America's Robin Roberts on a flight to my mother's funeral in 1994, and how kind she was during that difficult time.": "Gayle",
  "It's frightening to think about more sanctions. When I've met North Koreans in China, they've said to me, 'You have no idea how difficult our lives are. We live like dogs.' They wake up in the morning wondering what they're going to eat for dinner.": "Barbara",
  "I spent many a summer early morning with the radio very low, half sleeping and half listening.": "Frankie",
  "You say something stupid and the next morning you're in the headlines.": "Barry",
  "I get up in the morning, look around, arrange and rearrange things, and imagine how I might like them to look. Why doesn't everybody?": "Anouska",
  "I started playing poker in 2003 during my pregnancy, to distract myself from my awful morning sickness. For months all I did was cry and play Texas Hold'em.": "Cheryl",
  "I write early in the morning. I just wake up whenever I feel awake and I have to be sitting and writing pretty soon after that. If I take too long to think about the impossibility of what I'm trying to, I'll be defeated by it.": "Tim",
  "My morning routine is quite common: I have breakfast at home while reading the newspaper, I take a shower, get dressed, a spray of cologne, and I am ready to go!": "Domenico",
  "If a woman gets insomnia, you never know where you're going to find her furniture the next morning. It's primal. We have so little we can control, but we can perfect the way our room looks.": "Nicole",
  "Chronic malnutrition, or the lack of proper nutrition over time directly contributes to three times as many child deaths as food scarcity. Yet surprisingly, you don't really hear about this hidden crisis through the morning news, Twitter or headlines of major newspapers.": "Cat",
  "A large amount of constant activity will get things going. For example, training in the morning will have everything, all the juices flowing by the time you actually get to work. So, when you're at work, you've been already up for an hour or so or two hours, and you're raring to go where everyone else is still wiping sleep out of their eyes.": "Henry",
  "I'm a morning person, so rising at 4-something on weekends is not a huge challenge for me. I am not, however, much of a morning eater - not at that hour, at least.": "Lester",
  "I don't want to be in my car all day. I love getting up in the morning in Venice and walking my dogs down to the cafe to get my tea, and then perhaps going to a bookstore and sitting and reading, then walking to the beach.": "Jessica",
  "Your body knows how old you are, but if you keep on and you take care of yourself - you know, I go to kickboxing class every morning at 5 A.M. You know, try to do all the things to take care of the outside of your body, but you also should do - and have to do things that take care of the inside of your body.": "Darlene",
  "I don't have to get up in the morning and go beat up my body like I used to. I don't have to be out there in August in 108 degree weather down in Texas.": "Emmitt",
  "Holiday? Is like, what? I'm a hyperactive girl, so it may be boring for me to be on the beach doing nothing. I just need to find a place for three weeks and work but sleep in the morning, maybe write a little bit, have a glass of red wine. That's my perfect holiday.": "Melanie",
  "A young dog's faith is absolute... Dogs are notorious for hope. Dogs believe that this morning, this very morning, may begin a day of fascination, easily grander than any day in the past.": "Donald",
  "Beverly Hills is too intimidating. Everyone's got lovely teeth, so you don't want to smile. Everyone's ripped, so you start working out at 4 in the morning and eating egg white omelets.": "Rob",
  "My principal motivation is supporting my family, which is not a bad reason for getting up in the morning. That's always been my motivation - to take care of the people who rely on me.": "Tony",
  "My wife gets pampered pretty well. She's had me trained since she was pregnant, when I started making her oatmeal with fresh berries every morning.": "Michael",
  "The Weezer 'Blue' Album is a classic. I think My Morning Jacket's 'Circuital' is a great album to have. Any Led Zeppelin album. Pink Floyd 'The Dark Side Of The Moon' or 'Animals.' I always catch myself at concerts being like, 'Oh, I just stared at the drummer for 15 straight minutes.' I study them.": "Christopher",
  "There are 435 members of Congress. There's one 'Morning Joe' show. Hopefully, we can keep hammering the argument that you can disagree with other people and have debates but remain civil.": "Joe",
  "If some great catastrophe is not announced every morning, we feel a certain void. Nothing in the paper today, we sigh.": "Lord",
  "I used to pride myself on being the first in the office in the morning and one of the last to leave at night. Now, that's so dated: It's not about effort, it's about outcomes.": "Maynard",
  "We know that a man can read Goethe or Rilke in the evening, that he can play Bach and Schubert, and go to his day's work at Auschwitz in the morning.": "George",
  "Internet marketing entrepreneurs have truly opened my eyes to just how important a quick turnaround time can be. Often times, an interview they conduct with me today is online by the next morning. The interviewee is then able to start making money less than 24 hours after the initial interview.": "Marc",
  "I have the best job in the world. I wake up every morning energized at the thought of running Rio de Janeiro, the most exciting city on the planet.": "Eduardo",
  "I can write all the way through the morning, when my mind is clear, and there are no distractions.": "Karen",
  "As a producer, the most important call you can get is on Saturday morning, when the Friday-night grosses come in. As a director, you want your film to be successful. But your outlook is a bit different. You become very conscious of the reviews.": "Irwin",
  "My dad used to wake me up at 5:30 in the morning and hit me ground balls and tell me, 'Don't be afraid to excel. Don't be afraid to be great.'": "Russell",
  "The most efficient way to live reasonably is every morning to make a plan of one's day and every night to examine the results obtained.": "Alexis",
  "Training is full-on. Some days I really don't want to get out of bed and hit that track again. Sunday and Monday morning sessions are always horrible. But who really looks forward to going to work on a Monday morning?": "Jessica",
  "I love the smell of shampoo on a girl's hair. You can walk past someone and be like, 'Wow, you took a shower this morning, didn't you? Because you smell lovely.'": "Jensen",
  "When you have to get into the character each morning, give it your voice, your face, it was torture.": "Victoria",
  "I love playing 'Madame Vastra.' Although I do suffer, spending three-and-a-half hours in make-up every morning to have her lizard skin put on. I was so excited the first day when we did the make-up test, but after six hours, I was like, 'Can we finish now?'": "Neve",
  "The plane took off at 8:10 in the morning - or that's when it was scheduled to take off. And that's when I believe it took off. I had been in my office at the Department of Justice. Someone told me that there had been the two strikes that occurred at the World Trade Center.": "Ted",
  "As soon as I began, it seemed impossible to write fast enough - I wrote faster than I would write a letter - two thousand to three thousand words in a morning, and I cannot help it.": "Helen",
  "I wake up very early in the morning. I like to start in the dark, and I never work at night, because my brain is evaporated by 4 P.M.": "Alice",
  "I get up at sunrise. I'm a Buddhist, so I chant in the morning. My wife and I sit and have coffee together, but then it's list-making time. I have carpentry projects. We have roads we keep in repair. It's not back-breaking, but it's certainly aerobic and mildly strenuous.": "Patrick",
  "I am on my way to Ghana tomorrow morning and you just need to know that this Administration is very focused on doing all we can to promote economic development in this part of the world, in Africa, throughout Africa, North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa.": "Donald",
  "Work is a prayer, and I start off every morning dedicating it to our Creator.": "Joe",

  "The average, healthy, well-adjusted adult gets up at seven-thirty in the morning feeling just plain terrible.": "Jean",
  "I never really look for anything. What God throws my way comes. I wake up in the morning and whichever way God turns my feet, I go.": "Pearl",
  "I am an avid fisherman, and my daily schedule is to write in the morning and then go fishing in the afternoon. In Maine, I fish mostly for stripers, and in the Florida Keys, I go after all kinds of game fish.": "Rodman",
  "You get up about 2-3 o'clock in the morning and get through about 7 or 8 and 12 hours later you start all over. That's the worst kind of work a person can do. You have to do these two shifts to get one day.": "Buck",
  "I don't think I'm going to do any good work this morning.": "David",
  "Probably millions of Americans got up this morning with a cup of coffee, a cigarette and a donut. No wonder they are sick and fouled up.": "Jack",
  "Day and night cannot dwell together. The Red Man has ever fled the approach of the White Man, as the morning mist flees before the morning sun.": "Chief",
  "My very first car was a grey Alfa Romeo Alfasud, which I got in 1987. But, in our family, all cars were for sale - so they might be there in the morning and were gone at night. In the mid-90s, I joined Porsche and the Carrera was the car, and the Carrera 4S was the one they gave me. As a wee boy from Dumfries, I couldn't believe it.": "Allan",
  "I don't know why you call it morning sickness, because I was sick all day and night!": "Soleil",
  "When I opened the world's largest Internet cafe, certified by the 'Guinness Book of Records,' in Times Square in New York, I was live on 'Good Morning America,' and for me, that was an achievement.": "Stelios",
  "Growing up in Canada, none of my family were performers or anything like that, but I was terrible at hockey, so they needed something for me to do on Saturdays for me to get out of the house. I signed up for theater school on Saturdays, and I'd go for four-and-a-half hours every Saturday morning and learn about theater.": "Eric",
  "When I read the pilot 'for Married with Children', it just reminded me of my Uncle Joe... just a self-deprecating kind of guy. He'd come home from work, and the wife would maybe say 'I ran over the dog this morning in the driveway'. And he would say 'Fine, what's for dinner?": "Ed",
  "You can't be as old as I am without waking up with a surprised look on your face every morning: 'Holy Christ, whaddya know - I'm still around!' It's absolutely amazing that I survived all the booze and smoking and the cars and the career.": "Paul",
  "Experience has taught me, when I am shaving of a morning, to keep watch over my thoughts, because, if a line of poetry strays into my memory, my skin bristles so that the razor ceases to act.": "A.",
  "I get up at an unholy hour in the morning my work day is completed by the time the sun rises. I have a slightly bad back which has made an enormous contribution to American literature.": "David",
  "What is life, when wanting love? Night without a morning; love's the cloudless summer sun, nature gay adorning.": "Robert",
  "I'm not a cooking person, so there's not much in the fridge. On the rare occasion that I do cook, I make myself breakfast. Eggs are my go-to in the morning for some protein. Orange juice as well. You have to start your day off with that.": "Eugenie",
  "I think the worst and most insidious procrastination for me is research. I will be looking for some bit of fact or figure to include in the novel, and before I know, I've wasted an entire morning delving into that subject matter without a word written.": "James",
  "Ice skating is very difficult. It takes a lot of discipline and a lot of hard work. It's fun, but you are there on the ice every morning freezing and trying to do these moves and these tricks.": "Michelle",
  "I write best in the morning, and I can only write for about half a day, that's about it.": "Norton",
  "To play a cop's wife - there's so much in that world, the wives or partners of anyone who is a first responder - it's not an easy job. It's not an easy way to live, to say goodbye to someone in the morning and not know what's going to happen throughout the day.": "Amy",
  "My wife and I make the bed every morning, but it's a queen size bed today, as opposed to a rack, you know, a small single bed, which I had in basic SEAL training.": "William",
  "Sometimes I miss out the morning's painting session and instead study my Japanese books in the open.": "Gustav",
  "In the Java Sea in Indonesia, I have seen fishers going out in the morning, six of them going out and coming back with five pounds of fish. That is the end point, a pound of fish per person per day to sell for rice. That's where fisheries go if you let it happen. That's where it stabilizes. These people cannot feed their families.": "Daniel",
  "I wake up every morning feeling lucky - which is driven by fear, no doubt, since I know it could all go away.": "Natasha",
  "My workout regimen at the moment is nonexistent. I wake up in the morning and brush my teeth. My toothbrush and deodorant are my only dumbbells. That's about it.": "Josh",
  "The soul is a muscle, and it needs to be exercised a little every day. Say a morning prayer just to say something.": "Catherine",
  "Tell him he can have my title, but I want it back in the morning.": "Jack",
  "It's always such a joy that you wake up in the morning and there's work to do.": "Jerome",
  "On a beautiful clear Sunday morning, myself and James Nesbitt jumped out of a plane together at 18,000 feet.": "Aidan",
  "I used to go play football matches in the morning, and I'd go straight from me football game to a dance competition.": "Tristan",
  "When Andrew went with the girls, we were talking all morning and he was saying, 'It's okay. Just remember we had such a good day. Our wedding was so perfect.' Because we're such a unit together. He made me feel very part of the day on April the 29th.": "Sarah",
  "I eat an egg every morning, and when I'm done, I almost always have the thought: 'There. Now even if I'm captured and starved, I'll be able to live off the protein of that egg for a while.'": "Miranda",
  "I find that when you do yoga, you don't crave unhealthy food. But I try to always let myself eat whatever I want. I have dessert or chocolate every day, but I'll only have a few bites. I try to have a little bit of cereal in the morning, and then I always try to have protein for dinner, too. But I eat pasta and stuff like that.": "Rena",
  "If there was no Black Sabbath, I could still possibly be a morning newspaper delivery boy. No fun.": "Lars",
  "I'm a morning person because I learned to write my novels while still practicing law. I would get to the office at 6:30 a.m. and write until other people arrived, around 9. Now I still do that. I start at 6:30 or 7, and I'll write until 11, then take an hour off, then work until about 2 p.m. By then my brain has had enough.": "Steve",
  "Everybody's after a new morning. What do we have to run up and salute tomorrow?": "Robert",
  "I was in New York for a little while, doing some really bad theater. I did some great stuff, too, but there were Saturday morning theater performances in one-third-filled church basements. So, I paid my dues.": "Silas",
  "Running clears my mind, and gives me a reason to get out of bed in the morning.": "Ronnie",
  "When you awaken some morning and hear that somebody or other has been discovered, you can put it down as a fact that he discovered himself years ago - since that time he has been toiling, working, and striving to make himself worthy of general discovery.": "James",
  "If I'm on location on some island, we usually get up at four in the morning to set up. By seven thirty, we're on the beach working until noon, then we rest. It's not exactly a vacation.": "Daniela",
  "The 6th of August in the morning we saw an opening in the land and we ran into it, and anchored in 7 and a half fathom water, 2 miles from the shore, clean sand.": "William",
  "You know the stories of a woman saying to Churchill, 'Sir, you're drunk,' and he said to her, 'And you're ugly, but in the morning I'll be sober.' I was really excited to do that scene, but I did get slapped.": "Thomas",
  "My eighth-grade year, I was home-schooled. I'd basically wake up, go to the gym in the morning, do a little bit of school, go to practice, do a little more school, then go back to practice. My mom had a crockpot and a mini traveling oven, so we'd be cooking and eating dinners at the gym.": "Jacob",
  "My life is fairly normal. I didn't wake up one morning and find out that I'm suddenly a star, with people clamoring at me. I feel like I'm moving up the ladder just a little, which is fine.": "Daniel",
  "The sound of the blades on the ice in the morning is like smelling fresh coffee.": "Tara",
  "One morning, in February 1986, out of nowhere, I experienced a realization. In an instant, I discovered that when I believed my stressful thoughts, I suffered, but when I questioned them, I didn't suffer.": "Byron",
  "Playing characters who are wonderful and beautiful is hard because you don't feel like that most of the time... well, I don't. It's like this whole heart-throb nonsense. It's flattering, but that's not how I feel in the morning. It's something that goes with the job.": "Hans",
  "I'm not very into pastas or heavy foods like meat, but pastries, especially if they come from a really nice French bakery, I go crazy over! I try to allow myself those little treats in the morning for breakfast, then I have a lighter lunch.": "Barbara",
  "I had always thought, for 'Roman Empire,' I would love to do the death of Marcus Aurelius in the snow. One morning I woke up, and it was really snowing.": "Anthony",
  "I shall begin my march for Camp tomorrow morning. It was not in my power to move until I could procure shoes for the troops almost barefoot.": "Anthony",
  "I was a sophomore in college, and I did an industrial video about how to use the Internet - that dates me! It was with John Turturro, somehow they had gotten John Turturro to do this thing, and I was so excited and so nervous I probably drank 10 cups of coffee that morning.": "Warren",
  "When we lost Bobby, I would wake up in the morning and think, 'He's OK. He's in Heaven, and he's with Jack and a lot of my brothers and sisters and my parents.' So it made it very easy to get through the day thinking he was OK.": "Ethel",
  "I've always thought 'Today' is an iconic staple of morning life.": "Scott",
  "Early this morning, I signed my death warrant.": "Michael",
  "Talent wins games, but teamwork and intelligence wins championships.": "Michael",

  "Talent hits a target no one else can hit Genius hits a target no one else can see.": "Arthur",
  "Intelligence is the ability to adapt to change.": "Stephen",
  "A smart man makes a mistake, learns from it, and never makes that mistake again. But a wise man finds a smart man and learns from him how to avoid the mistake altogether.": "Roy",
  "Promise me you'll always remember: You're braver than you believe, and stronger than you seem, and smarter than you think.": "A.",
  "Your intellect may be confused, but your emotions will never lie to you.": "Roger",
  "I believe alien life is quite common in the universe, although intelligent life is less so. Some say it has yet to appear on planet Earth.": "Stephen",
  "Be as smart as you can, but remember that it is always better to be wise than to be smart.": "Alan",
  "I don't even call it violence when it's in self defense I call it intelligence.": "Malcolm",
  "Common sense is not so common.": "Voltaire",
  "Action is the real measure of intelligence.": "Napoleon",
  "By the way, intelligence to me isn't just being book-smart or having a college degree; it's trusting your gut instincts, being intuitive, thinking outside the box, and sometimes just realizing that things need to change and being smart enough to change it.": "Tabatha",
  "There are no great limits to growth because there are no limits of human intelligence, imagination, and wonder.": "Ronald",
  "Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power which knowledge gives.": "James",
  "The mind is not a vessel to be filled but a fire to be kindled.": "Plutarch",

  "Genius is talent set on fire by courage.": "Henry",
  "If you would take, you must first give, this is the beginning of intelligence.": "Lao",
  "The voice of the intelligence is drowned out by the roar of fear. It is ignored by the voice of desire. It is contradicted by the voice of shame. It is biased by hate and extinguished by anger. Most of all it is silenced by ignorance.": "Karl",
  "There is no worse screen to block out the Spirit than confidence in our own intelligence.": "John",
  "There are three kinds of intelligence: one kind understands things for itself, the other appreciates what others can understand, the third understands neither for itself nor through others. This first kind is excellent, the second good, and the third kind useless.": "Niccolo",
  "All of the biggest technological inventions created by man - the airplane, the automobile, the computer - says little about his intelligence, but speaks volumes about his laziness.": "Mark",
  "Empathy and social skills are social intelligence, the interpersonal part of emotional intelligence. That's why they look alike.": "Daniel",
  "Children are remarkable for their intelligence and ardor, for their curiosity, their intolerance of shams, the clarity and ruthlessness of their vision.": "Aldous",
  "If the presence of electricity can be made visible in any part of the circuit, I see no reason why intelligence may not be transmitted instantaneously by electricity.": "Samuel",
  "Intelligence is what you use when you don't know what to do: when neither innateness nor learning has prepared you for the particular situation.": "Jean",
  "I'm not offended by all the dumb blonde jokes because I know I'm not dumb... and I also know that I'm not blonde.": "Dolly",

  "An intellectual is a man who doesn't know how to park a bike.": "Spiro",
  "Sculpture is the art of the intelligence.": "Pablo",
  "Not to sound corny, but intelligence is big. Everything fades, and everything can be modified. But intelligence is something you can't fake. I'm not even talking about whether you can read a thesaurus backwards. But there is a beauty in common sense.": "Wale",
  "I'm grateful to intelligent people. That doesn't mean educated. That doesn't mean intellectual. I mean really intelligent. What black old people used to call 'mother wit' means intelligence that you had in your mother's womb. That's what you rely on. You know what's right to do.": "Maya",
  "Being an intellectual creates a lot of questions and no answers.": "Janis",

  "It is the mark of a truly intelligent person to be moved by statistics.": "George",
  "Beauty is a gift, just like good health or intelligence. The only thing is not to be proud of being beautiful. Because you didn't do anything - it was given to you.": "Monica",
  "Everybody has a hacking capability. And probably every intelligence service is hacking in the territory of other countries. But who exactly does what? That would be a very sensitive piece of information. But it's very difficult to communicate about it. Because nobody wants to admit the scope of what they're doing.": "Henry",
  "Immaturity is the incapacity to use one's intelligence without the guidance of another.": "Immanuel",
  "There is no reason and no way that a human mind can keep up with an artificial intelligence machine by 2035.": "Gray",
  "Strong government doesn't mean simply military power or an efficient intelligence apparatus. Instead, it should mean effective, fair administration - in other words, 'good governance.'": "Raghuram",

  "Anyone who conducts an argument by appealing to authority is not using his intelligence he is just using his memory.": "Leonardo",
  "Husbands, recognize your wife's intelligence and her ability to counsel with you as a real partner regarding family plans, family activities, and family budgeting. Don't be stingy with your time or with your means. Give her the opportunity to grow intellectually, emotionally, and socially as well as spiritually.": "Ezra",
  "Some people call this artificial intelligence, but the reality is this technology will enhance us. So instead of artificial intelligence, I think we'll augment our intelligence.": "Ginni",
  "As liberty and intelligence have increased the people have more and more revolted against the theological dogmas that contradict common sense and wound the tenderest sensibilities of the soul.": "Catharine",
  "Artificial intelligence is growing up fast, as are robots whose facial expressions can elicit empathy and make your mirror neurons quiver.": "Diane",
  "People who fail to use their emotional intelligence skills are more likely to turn to other, less effective means of managing their mood. They are twice as likely to experience anxiety, depression, substance abuse, and even thoughts of suicide.": "Travis",
  "No one in this world, so far as I know - and I have searched the records for years, and employed agents to help me - has ever lost money by underestimating the intelligence of the great masses of the plain people.": "H.",
  "I truly believe the intention of creating positive change is so important to the collective consciousness. When you have a group of people that have the intention and the capacity, talent, and intelligence to actualize those intentions, then you have something really powerful.": "Jimmy",
  "There are only two races on this planet - the intelligent and the stupid.": "John",
  "Evil is a source of moral intelligence in the sense that we need to learn from our shadow, from our dark side, in order to be good.": "John",
  "To think is to practice brain chemistry.": "Deepak",
  "The emotional brain responds to an event more quickly than the thinking brain.": "Daniel",
  "Americans born since World War II have grown up in a media-saturated environment. From childhood, we have developed a sort of advertising literacy, which combines appreciation for technique with skepticism about motives. We respond to ads with at least as much rhetorical intelligence as we apply to any other form of persuasion.": "Virginia",
  "Rational intelligence is dangerous and leads to ratiocination. The painter is a medium who doesn't realize what he is doing. No translation can express the mystery of sensibility, a word, still unreliable, which is nevertheless the basis of painting or poetry, like a kind of alchemy.": "Marcel",
  "The surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that it has never tried to contact us.": "Bill",
  "The greatest scholars are not usually the wisest people.": "Geoffrey",
  "When a true genius appears, you can know him by this sign: that all the dunces are in a confederacy against him.": "Jonathan",
  "You have to be smart. The easy days are over.": "Robert",
  "If you have the guts to keep making mistakes, your wisdom and intelligence leap forward with huge momentum.": "Holly",
  "The sad thing about artificial intelligence is that it lacks artifice and therefore intelligence.": "Jean",
  "Less intelligence capacity equals less safety.": "Mike",
  "Stupidity is infinitely more fascinating that intelligence. Intelligence has its limits while stupidity has none.": "Claude",
  "I think that intelligence is such a narrow branch of the tree of life - this branch of primates we call humans. No other animal, by our definition, can be considered intelligent. So intelligence can't be all that important for survival, because there are so many animals that don't have what we call intelligence, and they're surviving just fine.": "Neil",
  "What a distressing contrast there is between the radiant intelligence of the child and the feeble mentality of the average adult.": "Sigmund",
  "There are whole precincts of voters in this country whose united intelligence does not equal that of one representative American woman.": "Carrie",
  "Genius might be the ability to say a profound thing in a simple way.": "Charles",
  "There are some ideas so wrong that only a very intelligent person could believe in them.": "George",
  "Everybody does what she needs. And if you want plastic surgery, and then you feel better, why not? There is no law. I've nothing against using something to help your beauty - but do it in a good way, with intelligence.": "Monica",
  "I think the political class in Berlin doesn't need to be supervised and monitored by intelligence services in order to find out what they're thinking. Just go to lunch with them, go to dinner with them, or read the papers.": "Angela",
  "When asked if I miss being in government, I usually try to lighten the moment by responding that I awake most days, read the paper, and then observe that, 'It's yet another great day to be the former director of the Central Intelligence Agency.'": "Michael",
  "Intelligence is the ability to take in information from the world and to find patterns in that information that allow you to organize your perceptions and understand the external world.": "Brian",
  "When a thought takes one's breath away, a grammar lesson seems an impertinence.": "Thomas",
  "Don't leave home without your sword - your intellect.": "Alan",
  "You can use all the quantitative data you can get, but you still have to distrust it and use your own intelligence and judgment.": "Alvin",
  "Philosophy is a battle against the bewitchment of our intelligence by means of language.": "Ludwig",
  "In the Fall of 1774 & Winter of 1775, I was one of upwards of thirty, chiefly mechanics, who formed ourselves into a committee for the purpose of watching the movements of the British soldiers, and gaining every intelligence of the movements of the Tories.": "Paul",
  "Our government is founded upon the intelligence of the people. I for one do not despair of the republic. I have great confidence in the virtue of the great majority of the people, and I cannot fear the result.": "Andrew",
  "Being a unique superpower undermines the military intelligence of strategy. To think strategically, one has to imagine oneself in the enemy's place. If one cannot do this, it is impossible to foresee, to take by surprise, to outflank. Misinterpreting an enemy can lead to defeat. This is how empires fall.": "John",
  "Humanity I love you because when you're hard up you pawn your intelligence to buy a drink.": "e.",
  "When AI approximates Machine Intelligence, then many online and computer-run RPGs will move towards actual RPG activity. Nonetheless, that will not replace the experience of 'being there,' any more than seeing a theatrical motion picture can replace the stage play.": "Gary",
  "I need to add that my work on multiple intelligences received a huge boost in 1995 when Daniel Goleman published his book on emotional intelligence. I am often confused with Dan. Initially, though Dan and I are longtime friends, this confusion irritated me.": "Howard",
  "By far, the greatest danger of Artificial Intelligence is that people conclude too early that they understand it.": "Eliezer",
  "I think art is not an ornament or refinement at the fringes of human intelligence, I think it's at the center. It's at the core.": "Robert",
  "The most significant moment in the course of intellectual development, which gives birth to the purely human forms of practical and abstract intelligence, occurs when speech and practical activity, two previously completely independent lines of development, converge.": "Lev",
  "You have to talk about 'The Terminator' if you're talking about artificial intelligence. I actually think that that's way off. I don't think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.": "Gray",
  "We regard intelligence as man's main characteristic and we know that there is no superiority which intelligence cannot confer on us, no inferiority for which it cannot compensate.": "Henri",
  "Advertising: the science of arresting the human intelligence long enough to get money from it.": "Stephen",
  "All of our intelligence agencies, our Department of Defense, are all working to meet this threat. But it's a fast moving world; it's a place where offense is easier than defense, and keeping up with the next innovation in cyber-warfare is an enormous challenge.": "Mike",
  "The universe is an intelligence test.": "Timothy",
  "People don't want to believe that technology is broken. Pharmaceuticals, robotics, artificial intelligence, nanotechnology - all these areas where the progress has been a lot more limited than people think. And the question is why.": "Peter",
  "I'm a big advocate of financial intelligence.": "Daymond",
  "I think intelligence is totally subjective it's like sexiness.": "David",
  "Anything that could give rise to smarter-than-human intelligence - in the form of Artificial Intelligence, brain-computer interfaces, or neuroscience-based human intelligence enhancement - wins hands down beyond contest as doing the most to change the world. Nothing else is even in the same league.": "Eliezer",
  "In these troubled, uncertain times, we don't need more command and control; we need better means to engage everyone's intelligence in solving challenges and crises as they arise.": "Margaret",
  "We admire elephants in part because they demonstrate what we consider the finest human traits: empathy, self-awareness, and social intelligence. But the way we treat them puts on display the very worst of human behavior.": "Graydon",
  "We should take care not to make the intellect our god; it has, of course, powerful muscles, but no personality.": "Albert",
  "I have yet to meet members of a leadership team who I thought lacked the intelligence or the domain expertise required to be successful. I've met many, however, who failed to foster organizational health. Their companies were riddled with politics, various forms of dysfunction, and general confusion about their direction and mission.": "Patrick",
  "Humans have always used our intelligence and creativity to improve our existence. After all, we invented the wheel, discovered how to make fire, invented the printing press and found a vaccine for polio.": "Naveen",
  "The sign of an intelligent people is their ability to control their emotions by the application of reason.": "Marya",
  "I'm an optimist in the sense that I believe humans are noble and honorable, and some of them are really smart. I have a very optimistic view of individuals.": "Steve",
  "When I see a dolphin, I know it's just as smart as I am.": "Captain",
  "The original PATRIOT Act greatly increased our nation's ability to share intelligence information, made better use of technology, and provided terrorism investigators tools that have long been available in cases involving illegal drugs and organized crime.": "Michael",
  "Bottom line is, I didn't return to Apple to make a fortune. I've been very lucky in my life and already have one. When I was 25, my net worth was $100 million or so. I decided then that I wasn't going to let it ruin my life. There's no way you could ever spend it all, and I don't view wealth as something that validates my intelligence.": "Steve",
  "We live in worlds that we have forged and composed. It's much more true than any of the species that you see. I mean, it seems to me that one of the most distinctive features of human intelligence is the capacity to imagine, to project out of our own immediate circumstances and to bring to mind things that aren't present here and now.": "Ken",
  "So far as I can remember, there is not one word in the Gospels in praise of intelligence.": "Bertrand",
  "I ultimately got into robotics because for me, it was the best way to study intelligence.": "Sebastian",
  "Artificial intelligence, in fact, is obviously an intelligence transmitted by conscious subjects, an intelligence placed in equipment. It has a clear origin, in fact, in the intelligence of the human creators of such equipment.": "Pope",
  "Our bodies are shaped to bear children, and our lives are a working out of the processes of creation. All our ambitions and intelligence are beside that great elemental point.": "Saint",

  "Football is a game about feelings and intelligence.": "Jose",
  "Nothing is more important to national security and the making and conduct of good policy than timely, accurate, and relevant intelligence. Nothing is more critical to accurate and relevant intelligence than independent analysis.": "Dennis",
  "I was taught to think outside the box. Before my grandfather was one of the original Mad Men, he and a group of other Air Force Intelligence officers formalized brainstorming as a problem solving technique. He taught the concept that creativity can be taught at Buffalo University. My dad invented toys. My mom was a photographer.": "M.",
  "It is only the enlightened ruler and the wise general who will use the highest intelligence of the army for the purposes of spying, and thereby they achieve great results.": "Sun",
  "When the conscious mind expands to embrace deeper levels of thinking, the thought wave becomes more powerful and results in added energy and intelligence.": "Maharishi",
  "We should all feel confident in our intelligence. By the way, intelligence to me isn't just being book-smart or having a college degree; it's trusting your gut instincts, being intuitive, thinking outside the box, and sometimes just realizing that things need to change and being smart enough to change it.": "Tabatha",
  "It is by developing the individual that he is prepared for that wonderful manifestation of the human intelligence, which drawing constitutes. The ability to see reality in form, in color, in proportion, to be master of the movements of one's own hand - that is what is necessary.": "Maria",
  "I've always felt that a person's intelligence is directly reflected by the number of conflicting points of view he can entertain simultaneously on the same topic.": "Abigail",
  "Man is made or unmade by himself. By the right choice he ascends. As a being of power, intelligence, and love, and the lord of his own thoughts, he holds the key to every situation.": "James",
  "A government for the people must depend for its success on the intelligence, the morality, the justice, and the interest of the people themselves.": "Grover",
  "Intelligence is the faculty of making artificial objects, especially tools to make tools.": "Henri",
  "Artificial intelligence will reach human levels by around 2029. Follow that out further to, say, 2045, we will have multiplied the intelligence, the human biological machine intelligence of our civilization a billion-fold.": "Ray",

  "Foolishness is rarely a matter of lack of intelligence or even lack of information.": "John",
  "Prior to the passage of the Patriot Act, it was very difficult - often impossible - for us to share information with the Central Intelligence Agency, with NSA, with the other intelligence agencies, and likewise, for them to share information with us.": "Robert",
  "But once you are in that field, emotional intelligence emerges as a much stronger predictor of who will be most successful, because it is how we handle ourselves in our relationships that determines how well we do once we are in a given job.": "Daniel",
  "The Gorillaz cartoons seem more real to me than the actual people on TV. Because at least you know that there's some intelligence behind the cartoons, and there's a lot of work that's gone into it, so it can't all be just a lie.": "Damon",
  "It has always been my private conviction that any man who puts his intelligence up against a fish and loses had it coming.": "John",
  "There is no logical reason why the camel of great art should pass through the needle of mob intelligence.": "Rebecca",
  "Here's the teaching point, if you're teaching kids about intelligence and policy: Intelligence does not absolve policymakers of responsibility to ask tough questions, and it doesn't absolve them of having curiosity about the consequences of their actions.": "George",
  "Facebook is at the forefront. It's the company that can fundamentally change the way information is being exchanged and processed. It can be the basis for artificial intelligence to develop over time.": "Yuri",
  "We have three centers: the emotional center, the intellectual center, and the physical body center. Each one of them has its own intelligence. How much better would we be if all three were working in unison?": "Erin",
  "If you imagine someone with 100 percent determination and 100 percent intelligence, you can discard a lot of intelligence before they stop succeeding. But if you start discarding determination, you very quickly get an ineffectual and perpetual grad student.": "Paul",
  "I think intelligence is usually sexy until it becomes irritating. After that, you're stuck.": "Jim",
  "This idea that clumsy, stumbling people are real bright is ridiculous, because intelligence is related to neurologic function, and really intelligent people are very well-coordinated.": "Robert",
  "Beauty is an asset, just like physical prowess, charisma, brains or emotional intelligence. The key with any gift is in the way that you use it. It doesn't define you as a person. Rather, it's an asset to be used judiciously and with an understanding of how it is just a small part of who you are.": "Dale",
  "Journalism, as concerns collecting information, differs little if at all from intelligence work. In my judgment, a journalist's job is very interesting.": "Vladimir",
  "I think there can be a positive sort of futurism even in a presentist society. But I think it's a kind of futurism that envisions augmenting human ability and intellect rather than creating some artificial machine intelligence that displaces us.": "Douglas",
  "A lot of movies about artificial intelligence envision that AI's will be very intelligent but missing some key emotional qualities of humans and therefore turn out to be very dangerous.": "Ray",
  "The thing to keep in mind is that we're still in the very early days when it comes to the search for extraterrestrial intelligence. Saying there's a silence is a bit like if Columbus, looking to discover a new continent, only sailed 10 miles off the coast of Spain before turning back to say, 'Nothing out there!'": "Seth",
  "I think for leadership positions, emotional intelligence is more important than cognitive intelligence. People with emotional intelligence usually have a lot of cognitive intelligence, but that's not always true the other way around.": "John",
  "We must address, individually and collectively, moral and ethical issues raised by cutting-edge research in artificial intelligence and biotechnology, which will enable significant life extension, designer babies, and memory extraction.": "Klaus",
  "Some governments choose to cooperate with the United States in intelligence, law enforcement, or military matters. The co-operation is a two-way street. We share intelligence that has helped protect European countries from attack, helping save European lives.": "Condoleezza",
  "Each angel that God created was in himself a masterpiece. Each one possessed his own degree of intelligence and his own beauty.": "Mother",
  "Which, autocracy or democracy, is really better suited to modern China? If we base our judgment upon the intelligence and the ability of the Chinese people, we come to the conclusion that the sovereignty of the people would be far more suitable for us.": "Sun",
  "The intelligence community is governed by the same legal and ethical standards as the rest of American government and society, but an operational imperative is here, too. An intelligence community charged with global responsibilities cannot be successful without diversity of thought, culture and language.": "Michael",
  "Chinese combatants, men and women, inheritors of a millennial culture, are people of uncommon intelligence and an invincible spirit of struggle.": "Fidel",
  "Having emotional intelligence allows you to manage your emotions, show empathy, and prevent you from getting distracted. It also helps you solve problems and be a more likable person.": "John",

  "What matters is hard work, and emotional intelligence.": "Millard",
  "Bill Gates wants people to think he's Edison, when he's really Rockefeller. Referring to Gates as the smartest man in America isn't right... wealth isn't the same thing as intelligence.": "Larry",

  "I certainly believe that improving our intelligence is of important national interest.": "Jeff",
  "The intelligence of the creature known as a crowd, is the square root of the number of people in it.": "Terry",
  "The intelligence of the lower forms of animal life, like a great deal of human intelligence, does not involve a self.": "George",
  "My father ran London Films. He made films like 'The Red Shoes,' 'The Third Man.' And he had had a long career in the film business, which was bifurcated with a career in intelligence. He had to deal with gangsters, and sometimes he would take me with him. Also, I went to school with their children.": "Mark",
  "There's a popular concept of 'intelligence' as book smarts, like calculus or chess, as opposed to, say, social skills. So people say that 'it takes more than intelligence to succeed in human society.' But social skills reside in the brain, not the kidneys.": "Eliezer",
  "Intelligence is the source of technology. If we can use technology to improve intelligence, that closes the loop and potentially creates a positive feedback cycle.": "Eliezer",
  "We must develop as quickly as possible technologies that make possible a direct connection between brain and computer, so that artificial brains contribute to human intelligence rather than opposing it.": "Stephen",
  "No one holds a permanent speed advantage in the market due to the limits of human intelligence and vision. Your advantage comes from your ability to feel the change faster and take decisive action faster.": "Guo",
  "Openness explains the ability to innovate and come up with big ideas because you're open to them, and fluid intelligence explains the ability to go and execute.": "Adeo",
  "I want parents to teach that academic intelligence is essential, but so is financial intelligence.": "Robert",

  "As long as we can get redress in the courts, as long as the laws shall be honestly administered, as long as honesty and intelligence sit upon the bench, as long as intelligence sits in the chairs of jurors, this country will stand, the law will be enforced, and the law will be respected.": "Robert",
  "I'm in awe of the universe, but I don't necessarily believe there's an intelligence or agent behind it. I do have a passion for the visual in religious rituals, though, even though they may be completely empty and bereft of substance.": "David",
  "Most of the intelligence out there must be artificial intelligence. We keep looking for critters like us living on a planet like ours, where in fact the majority of the intelligence out there is not biological. That would be my argument.": "Seth",
  "Clearly, unless thinking beings inevitably wipe themselves out soon after developing technology, extraterrestrial intelligence could often be millions or billions of years in advance of us. We're the galaxy's noodling newbies.": "Seth",
  "I was perfectly content before I was born, and I think of death as the same state. What I am grateful for is the gift of intelligence, and for life, love, wonder, and laughter. You can't say it wasn't interesting. My lifetime's memories are what I have brought home from the trip.": "Roger",
  "To accomplish its mission, the FBI relies heavily upon its law enforcement and intelligence partners around the nation and around the globe. By combining our resources and our collective expertise, we are able to investigate national security threats that cross both geographical and jurisdictional boundaries.": "James",
  "Mr. Speaker, we are a blessed Nation. We have not suffered another attack on our soil since September 11, and we are grateful. We have killed or captured dozens of members of al Qaeda and the Taliban. Our military and intelligence forces are working both hard and smart.": "Marsha",
  "Artificial intelligence is one of 50 things that Watson does. There is also machine learning, text-to-speech, speech-to-text, and different analytical engines - they're like little Lego bricks. You can put intelligence in any product or any process you have.": "Ginni",

  "I respect the audience's intelligence a lot, and that's why I don't try to go for the lowest common denominator.": "Spike",
  "I wasn't a spy. I'd have been spotted in five seconds. Yes, I was in intelligence, but that covered a multitude of things.": "Christopher",
  "There is but one kind of love; God is love, and all his creatures derive theirs from his; only it is modified by the different degrees of intelligence in different beings and creatures.": "John",

  "Since the tragedies, the Department of Homeland Security was established to prevent terrorist attacks within the United States, and most importantly, to share intelligence information among government agencies and departments.": "Randy",
  "I think that animals aren't less intelligent than humans, they're just of a different intelligence. We have five million smell-sensitive cells in our nose, they have two hundred and fifty million - they can smell emotion. They can smell different types of emotion, they just have another type of intelligence.": "Mike",
  "The purest case of an intelligence explosion would be an Artificial Intelligence rewriting its own source code. The key idea is that if you can improve intelligence even a little, the process accelerates. It's a tipping point. Like trying to balance a pen on one end - as soon as it tilts even a little, it quickly falls the rest of the way.": "Eliezer",
  "I think there are profound differences between women and men. In intelligence and creativity, there is no difference, but in what one loves, what one likes, the passions - there are differences.": "Christiane",
  "The key to artificial intelligence has always been the representation.": "Jeff",
  "The higher the general average of intelligence, all things else being equal, the less the disposition to be meddlesome, critical, and overbearing.": "Paul",
  "There's three things: there's masculinity, there's intelligence, there's sensitivity. You've got to bring those three things to a leading man's role: masculinity, sensitivity, intelligence. In some people, there's a little too much in the mix of one or the other.": "Alec",
  "The object of pure physics is the unfolding of the laws of the intelligible world the object of pure mathematics that of unfolding the laws of human intelligence.": "James",

  "Only a well-rounded intellect, a spirit nourished in the eternal sources of intelligence and culture, of justice and wisdom, is a safeguard against both indifference and skepticism.": "Ameen",
  "Nobody phrases it this way, but I think that artificial intelligence is almost a humanities discipline. It's really an attempt to understand human intelligence and human cognition.": "Sebastian",
  "We should not pretend to understand the world only by the intellect. The judgement of the intellect is only part of the truth.": "Carl",
  "I choose my friends for their good looks, my acquaintances for their good characters, and my enemies for their intellects. A man cannot be too careful in the choice of his enemies.": "Oscar",
  "Quick condemnation of all that is not ours, of views with which we disagree, of ideas that do not attract us, is the sign of a narrow mind, of an uncultivated intelligence. Bigotry is always ignorant, and the wise boy, who will become the wise man, tries to understand and to see the truth in ideas with which he does not agree.": "Annie",
  "I know this world is ruled by infinite intelligence. Everything that surrounds us- everything that exists - proves that there are infinite laws behind it. There can be no denying this fact. It is mathematical in its precision.": "Thomas",

  "The modern mind is in complete disarray. Knowledge has stretched itself to the point where neither the world nor our intelligence can find any foot-hold. It is a fact that we are suffering from nihilism.": "Albert",
  "The first thing I did after getting a Master's degree - and the Air Force was very kind; they let me stay on at school to get a Master's - I went to Denver for the Armed Forces Air Intelligence School, six months. Fundamentally, we had a major effort on in Southeast Asia, and this was training folks to support that effort.": "Michael",

  "It is good to rub and polish our brain against that of others.": "Michel",
  "Kindness and intelligence don't always deliver us from the pitfalls and traps: there are always failures of love, of will, of imagination. There is no way to take the danger out of human relationships.": "Barbara",
  "To educate the intelligence is to expand the horizon of its wants and desires.": "James",
  "Human intelligence is a reflection of the intelligence that produces everything. In knowing, we are simply extending the intelligence that comes to and constitutes us. We mimic the mind of God, so to speak. Or better, we continue and extend it.": "Huston",

  "It occurred to me that there was no difference between men, in intelligence or race, so profound as the difference between the sick and the well.": "F.",
  "All the intelligence and talent in the world can't make a singer. The voice is a wild thing. It can't be bred in captivity. It is a sport, like the silver fox. It happens.": "Willa",
  "What interests me is whatever it is that allows the heart to continue to yearn for something the intelligence knows is impossible to have: a lost love, a shelter from life's blows, the return of a time past, even a connection to the dead.": "Alice",
  "The main functions of intelligence, that of inventing solutions and that of verifying them, do not necessarily involve one another. The first partakes of imagination; the second alone is properly logical.": "Jean",

  "When our governments want to sell us a course of action, they do it by making sure it's the only thing on the agenda, the only thing everyone's talking about.

  "If the government regulates against use of drones or stem cells or artificial intelligence, all that means is that the work and the research leave the borders of that country and go someplace else.": "Peter",
  "Logical activity is not the whole of intelligence. One can be intelligent without being particularly logical.": "Jean",
  "If intelligence is the triumph of life, the spoken word is the marvellous means by which this intelligence is manifested.": "Maria",
  "My dad is still Christian Scientist. My mom's not, and I'm not. But I believe in God, and that there's a higher power and an intelligence that's bigger than us and that we can rely on. It's not just us, thinking we are the ones in control of everything. That idea gives me support.": "Ellen",
  "When you talk to a human in 2035, you'll be talking to someone that's a combination of biological and non-biological intelligence.": "Ray",
  "The child's mind is not the type of mind we adults possess. If we call our type of mind the conscious type, that of the child is an unconscious mind. Now an unconscious mind does not mean an inferior mind. An unconscious mind can be full of intelligence. One will find this type of intelligence in every being, and every insect has it.": "Maria",
  "Republics are created by the virtue, public spirit, and intelligence of the citizens. They fall, when the wise are banished from the public councils, because they dare to be honest, and the profligate are rewarded, because they flatter the people, in order to betray them.": "Joseph",

  "I have beauty, intelligence, individuality, sensuality and sexuality.": "Shannon",
  "Nerds... the 'nerd' has never been precisely defined, thanks to the psychological complexity of the creature. The word has connotations of some level of intelligence. The typical nerd is a male with intelligence but no sense of giving it a manly face.": "Tom",

  "Intelligence is usually easy to tell in a 10-minute conversation. Determination is harder.": "Sam",
  "A person isn't born with the intelligence to be with someone special; you learn it, and you fail in the path of life, but you don't have to give up the chance to love.": "Gael",
  "The ISI is above all a paramilitary organization. It doesn't do all that much collection of intelligence. It's not a very good spy agency, but it's good at running covert action.": "David",

  "From the lowest animals of which we can affirm intelligence up to man this type of intellect is found.": "Edward",
  "I want to go to Mexico. I've been stonewalled, so far, by federal officials. I want to go to Mexico, and I want to meet with the top Mexican officials.

  "In archaeology, context is the basis of many discoveries that are imputed to the deliberate workings of intelligence.

  "I think the very idea of character, of developing not just grit, but empathy and curiosity, emotional intelligence - you know, the things that I want my own daughters to develop - the idea that we're going to get there through rewards and punishments seems completely at odds with the idea of character itself.": "Angela",

  "Genius always finds itself a century too early.": "Ralph",
  "As far as U.S. intelligence knows, Iran is developing nuclear capacities, but they don't know if they are trying to develop nuclear weapons or not. Chances are they're developing what's called 'nuclear capability,' which many states have. That is the ability to have nuclear weapons if they decide to do it. That's not a crime.": "Noam",

  "Thought is more than a right - it is the very breath of man. Whoever fetters thought attacks man himself.

  "There is not a separate God for each person. There is one universal intelligence flowing through all of us.": "Wayne",
  "I think intelligence basically can be in a way defined by the possibility of having two opposite ideas living together and at the same time functioning. That's why I think a smart script has two things living in the same place, and they're absolutely contradictory.": "Alejandro",
  "The Obama administration appears to regard intelligence leaks and briefings more or less like briefings by the Democratic National Committee or White House flack Jay Carney. You use any information at hand, classified or not, and you spin it any way you like, fairly or not.": "Elliott",

  "In the spring of 2007, Israeli intelligence brought to Washington proof that the Assad regime in Syria was building a nuclear reactor along the Euphrates - with North Korean help.

  "Is E.T. out there? Well, I work at the SETI Institute. That's almost my name. SETI: Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence. In other words, I look for aliens, and when I tell people that at a cocktail party, they usually look at me with a mildly incredulous look on their face. I try to keep my own face somewhat dispassionate.": "Seth",
  "The fact that we can't easily foresee clues that would betray an intelligence a million millennia farther down the road suggests that we're like ants trying to discover humans. Ask yourself: Would ants ever recognize houses, cars, or fire hydrants as the work of advanced biology?": "Seth",
  "The total funding of SETI (the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) in the U.S. is 0.0003 percent of the tax monies spent on health and human services. And it's not even tax money. The SETI Institute's hunt for signals is funded by donations.": "Seth",
  "The cosmos is three times as old as Earth. During most of creation's 14 billion year history, our solar system wasn't around. Nonetheless, the early universe still had the right stuff for life, and contained worlds that were just as suitable for spawning biology and intelligence as our own.": "Seth",
  "Humans have existed only for the last 0.001 percent of cosmic time.

And that intelligence is more than just a little bit beyond.": "Seth",
  "I think there's a lot of intelligence out there, but that's just my guess. Question is: Are they peaceable or hostile? You could say that the peaceable ones are just going to stay at home and play with their Nintendos, so if you do meet any of them, they might be hostile.": "Seth",

  "I enjoy taking part in footballing events that are for social causes because, in my view, inspiring children through sport is a way of keeping their bodies and minds healthy as well as helping nurture their intelligence and ability to relate with others.": "Shakira",
  "We need intelligence services to fight against terrorism, but they have to respect the principles of good relationships between allies and protect personal, confidential data.": "Francois",
  "If one of the arguments against eating meat is to do with cruelty and animal intelligence, then lab meat avoids that. There's also the environmental argument for it.": "Margaret",
  "After 9/11, whatever the evidence of intelligence failures, many people still saw that attack as almost unimaginable, so brutal and brazen an assault.": "Nancy",

  "U.S. intelligence services routinely use collection methods against foreigners that foreseeably - with certainty - ingest high volumes of U.S. communications as well.": "Barton",
  "The $52.6 billion U.S. intelligence arsenal is aimed mainly at unambiguous adversaries, including al-Qaida, North Korea and Iran. But top-secret budget documents reveal an equally intense focus on one purported ally: Pakistan.": "Barton",
  "The government of Sudan, employing a back channel direct from its president to the Central Intelligence Agency, offered in the early spring of 1996 to arrest Osama bin Laden and place him in Saudi custody, according to officials and former officials in all three countries.": "Barton",
  "Superior virtue must be the fruit of superior intelligence.": "William",
  "The way to defeat international terrorism is through international cooperation based on international law, clear intelligence, and a measured and appropriate military response.": "Charles",
  "It's not new: In the '70s, Archie Bunker said terrible things on 'All in the Family,' but it was all in Carroll O'Connor's performance. You saw lack of intelligence, and you laughed.": "Jason",
  "It is a curious thing: man, the centre and creator of all science, is the only object which our science has not yet succeeded in including in a homogeneous representation of the universe. We know the history of his bones, but no ordered place has yet been found in nature for his reflective intelligence.": "Pierre",
  "Progressively saved by the machine from the anxieties that bound his hands and mind to material toil, relieved of a large part of his work and compelled to an ever-increasing speed of action by the devices which his intelligence cannot help ceaselessly creating and perfecting, man is about to find himself abruptly plunged into idleness.": "Pierre",
  "Birds and animals probably think without knowing that they think; that is, they have not self-consciousness. Only man seems to be endowed with this faculty; he alone develops disinterested intelligence, intelligence that is not primarily concerned with his own safety and well-being but that looks abroad upon things.": "John",
  "Fear, love, and hunger were the agents that developed the wits of the lower animals, as they were, of course, the prime factors in developing the intelligence of man.": "John",
  "As a college student, what really interested me was the human brain and human intelligence.": "Sebastian",
  "When you program a robot to be intelligent, you learn a number of things. You become very humble and develop enormous respect for natural intelligence because, even if you work day and night for several years, your robot isn't that smart after all.": "Sebastian",
  "You could claim that moving from pixelated perception, where the robot looks at sensor data, to understanding and predicting the environment is a Holy Grail of artificial intelligence.": "Sebastian",
  "Foreigners who speak Arabic in the Middle East are often assumed to be working for the C.I.A. or Israel's intelligence agency, the Mossad.": "Richard",
  "I don't believe that intelligence can be reduced to a number, frankly. But I can see how doing exactly that produces a useful sorting mechanism in our society in order to separate children into categories of promising and doomed. The tests seem arbitrary and without real scientific value and yet have lasting consequences.": "Rachel",
  "Genius creates, and taste preserves. Taste is the good sense of genius; without taste, genius is only sublime folly.": "Alexander",
  "The bookful blockhead, ignorantly read, With loads of learned lumber in his head.": "Alexander",
  "Intelligence is quickness in seeing things as they are.": "George",
  "My dad used to say, 'Just because you dress up in a coat and tie, it doesn't influence your intelligence.'": "Tiger",
  "Is artificial intelligence less than our intelligence?": "Spike",
  "No one knows when a robot will approach human intelligence, but I suspect it will be late in the 21st century. Will they be dangerous? Possibly. So I suggest we put a chip in their brain to shut them off if they have murderous thoughts.": "Michio",
  "I have concluded that we are in a world made by rules created by an intelligence.": "Michio",
  "The FBI has built up substantial expertise to address cyber threats, both in the homeland and overseas. Here at home, the FBI serves as the executive agent for the National Cyber Investigative Joint Task Force (NCIJTF), which joins together 19 intelligence, law enforcement, and military agencies to coordinate cyber threat investigations.": "James",
  "As a digital technology writer, I have had more than one former student and colleague tell me about digital switchers they have serviced through which calls and data are diverted to government servers or the big data algorithms they've written to be used on our e-mails by intelligence agencies.": "Douglas",
  "By their very nature, heuristic shortcuts will produce biases, and that is true for both humans and artificial intelligence, but the heuristics of AI are not necessarily the human ones.": "Daniel",
  "Others can challenge and motivate us, but we must reach down deep into our souls and call forth our God-given intelligence and capabilities. We cannot do this when we depend on the efforts of someone else.": "James",
  "GTMO has been a goldmine of intelligence about radical Islamic terrorism.": "Mike",
  "As a member of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, I know that the CIA, Treasury Department, National Security Agency, and others work closely to keep tabs on the IRGC's operations.": "Mike",
  "I am proud to serve on the House Intelligence Committee, and every day, I see the lifesaving work of our men and women in uniform.": "Mike",
  "Human language is the new UI layer, bots are like new applications, and digital assistants are meta apps. Intelligence is infused into all of your interactions.": "Satya",
  "We want to build intelligence that augments human abilities and experiences.": "Satya",
  "There can be no two opinions as to what a highbrow is. He is the man or woman of thoroughbred intelligence who rides his mind at a gallop across country in pursuit of an idea.": "Virginia",
  "If we are going to conduct espionage in the future, we are going to have to make some changes in the relationship between the intelligence community and the public it serves.": "Michael",
  "An intelligence analyst may attribute an attack to al Qaeda, whereas a policy maker could opt for the more general 'extremist.'": "Michael",
  "There's this movie, 'Zero Dark Thirty' about the hunt for Osama bin Laden. Some have complained that too many 'secrets' were dished out by the intelligence and special operations communities to director Kathryn Bigelow, screenwriter Mark Boal and their crew, part of a broader pattern of using intelligence for political effect.": "Michael",
  "There is no part of the executive branch that more exists on the outer edge of executive prerogative than the American intelligence community - the intelligence community, CIA, covert action. My literal responsibility as director of CIA with regard to covert action was to inform the Congress - not to seek their approval, to inform.": "Michael",
  "American political elites feel very empowered to criticize the American intelligence community for not doing enough when they feel in danger, and as soon as we've made them feel safe again, they feel equally empowered to complain that we're doing too much.": "Michael",
  "I believe we do have a great intelligence service. Is it good enough in all circumstances? Of course not. We live in the human condition. We try to make it better each day.": "Michael",
  "I have spent my adult life working in American intelligence. It has been quite an honor. Generally well resourced. A global mission. No want of issues. And it was a hell of a ride.": "Michael",
  "The FISA Amendment Act of 2008 actually allows some of the things we were doing under the president's authority only against al Qaeda, it allows them for all legitimate foreign intelligence purposes.": "Michael",
  "Renditions before and since 9/11 share some basic features. They have been conducted lawfully, responsibly and with a clear and single purpose: Get terrorists off the street and gain intelligence on those still at large. Our detention and interrogation programs flow from the same inescapable logic.": "Michael",
  "President Obama and his successors are dependent on the 100,000-plus people inside the American intelligence community - the people Edward Snowden betrayed.": "Michael",
  "Americans are very practical folks. Accustomed to hard choices in their own lives, they are willing to give us in intelligence a lot of slack as we make the hard choices our profession demands.": "Michael",
  "Politicization - the shading of analysis to fit prevailing policy or politics - is the harshest criticism one can make of an intelligence organization. It strikes beyond questions of competence to the fundamental ethic of the enterprise, which is, or should be, truth telling.": "Michael",
  "Dissenting analysts passionate about their positions are not unusual in the American intelligence community. Their presence - or even the rejection - of their favored positions is not prima face evidence of politicization.": "Michael",
  "The 2007 National Intelligence Estimate that said Iran had paused its nuclear weaponization work also reported with high confidence that such work had been going on through 2003. How far did they get? That's an important question, but I fear that the Iranians will never answer it, and we will not insist that they do.": "Michael",
  "Intelligence collection is not confined to the communications of adversaries or of the guilty. Rather, it's about gaining information otherwise unavailable that would help keep Americans safe and free.": "Michael",
  "Presidents get to decide how their intelligence is served up to them, and it's the job of intelligence to adjust.": "Michael",
  "When the intelligence is making a policymaker too happy, he ought to challenge it, and even if he doesn't, the intelligence briefer needs to launch a red team against his own conclusions to see if he can hold his ground.": "Michael",
  "It's good to remind intelligence producers and consumers alike about the need to 'warn of emerging conditions, trends, threats and opportunities' and the potential for discontinuities.": "Michael",
  "Intelligence is often viewed as a profession that steals secrets and then knits those secrets together for policymakers in order to inform their judgments.": "Michael",
  "Another random thing I do is the search for extraterrestrial intelligence, or SETI. And you may be familiar with the movie 'Contact,' which sort of popularized that. It turns out there are real people who go out and search for extraterrestrials in a very scientific way.": "Nathan",
  "Intelligence is not a moral category.": "Tucker",
  "Ah! yes, I know: those who see me rarely trust my word: I must look too intelligent to keep it.": "Jean-Paul",
  "The trouble with people like Tony Blair is they get confused, they think intelligence is education when they're two different things.": "David",
  "Our personal intelligence is everlasting and divine.": "Russell",
  "It is better to have a fair intellect that is well used than a powerful one that is idle.": "Bryant",
  "Emotion is often what we rely upon to carry us across the unfathomable voids in our intelligence.": "Bryant",
  "Many openly show discontentment with their looks, but few with their intelligence. I, however, assure you there are many more plain minds than faces.": "Bryant",
  "Education, family, character, intelligence, humility, okay? These are the things that make a culture live.": "Jim",
  "Intelligence flourishes only in the ages when belief withers.": "Emile",
  "Judy, we think that since the 11th of September, 2001, we've faced a similar heightened threat level. And we've been enhancing both the exchange of intelligence and security information and the assessment of that information, because that's the crucial element.": "David",
  "If the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies were private companies and were chronically unable to accomplish one of their key missions, their shareholders would have long ago revolted, fired their management, and their stock would be trading at values near zero.": "Peter",
  "I don't think my intelligence is naturally analytic or political.": "Seamus",
  "Why have I been chosen to deliver the message of female intelligence and its divinity to a deaf world of males? I have asked my god that question and She answered, 'Hey, why not you Roseanne?' Indeed, why not each of us?": "Roseanne",
  "The fact is that a car used by Gerry Adams and myself during the course of the Mitchell review was bugged by elements within British military intelligence.": "Martin",
  "Post-human intelligence will develop hypercomputers with the processing power to simulate living things - even entire worlds. Perhaps advanced beings could use hypercomputers to surpass the best 'special effects' in movies or computer games so vastly that they could simulate a world, fully, as complex as the one we perceive ourselves to be in.": "Martin",
  "Here's the thing: I think the media underestimates the intelligence of the moviegoer. We need to be fulfilled. People want to sit down and think, and I try to make people think.": "Lee",
  "We know that there are unaccounted-for Scud and other ballistic missiles in Iraq. And part of the problem is that, since 1998, there has been no way to even get minimal information about those programs except through intelligence means.": "Condoleezza",
  "There is a huge difference between gathering intelligence in foreign countries, even our allies, and secretly getting information on U.S. citizens.": "Bob",
  "Ever since 9/11, our intelligence agencies, as part of the 'war on terror,' have expanded their operations to include American citizens. I was 'terrorized' when I learned that the National Security Agency was intercepting information on Americans.": "Bob",
  "We need to gather intelligence, but we need to do so legally.": "Bob",
  "If we have intelligence on the location of terrorist training centers, it is insane not to act.": "Bob",
  "Instead of assuming that emotional intelligence is always useful, we need to think more carefully about where and when it matters.": "Adam",
  "Intelligence and courtesy not always are combined Often in a wooden house a golden room we find.": "Henry",
  "I'd have thought my particular brand of quirkiness, combined with sharp intelligence and a fine voice, would have yielded more. But it hasn't. Yet!": "Miriam",
  "Your intelligence doesn't override your desire to destroy yourself.": "John",
  "While the crash only took place six months ago, I am convinced we have now passed the worst, and with continued unity of effort, we shall rapidly recover. There is one certainty of the future of a people of the resources, intelligence and character of the people of the United States - that is, prosperity.": "Herbert",
  "Politeness decrees that you must listen to be kind intelligence decrees that you must listen to learn.": "Letitia",
  "It's public knowledge that there have been efforts - as U.S. intelligence sources have said - by Russia to destabilize the U.S. political system. I think that Canadians and, indeed, other Western countries should be prepared for similar efforts to be directed at us.": "Chrystia",
  "Men we shall have only as we make manhood the object of the work of the schools - intelligence, broad sympathy, knowledge of the world that was and is, and of the relation of men to it - this is the curriculum of that Higher Education which must underlie true life.": "W.",
  "There are a lot of obstacles in the way of our understanding animal intelligence - not the least being that we can't even agree whether nonhuman species are conscious. We accept that chimps and dolphins experience awareness we like to think dogs and cats do. But what about mice and newts? What about a fly? Is anything going on there at all?": "Jeffrey",
  "Newt Gingrich has a restless and outsized intelligence that is tragically unleavened by any kind of critical sensibility.": "John",
  "The role of the intelligence - that part of us which affirms and denies and formulates opinions is merely to submit.": "Simone",
  "Whatever debases the intelligence degrades the entire human being.": "Simone",
  "Man is a spiritual intelligence, who has taken flesh with the object of gaining experience in worlds below the spiritual, in order that he may be able to master and to rule them, and in later ages take his place in the creative and directing hierarchies of the universe.": "Annie",
  "Strange indeed would it be if all the space around us be empty, mere waste void, and the inhabitants of Earth the only forms in which intelligence could clothe itself.": "Annie",
  "Men are at every stage of evolution, from the most barbarous to the most developed; men are found of lofty intelligence, but also of the most unevolved mentality; in one place there is a highly developed and complex civilisation, in another a crude and simple polity.": "Annie",
  "If the elections are a mere fraud, why are terrorists being trained and infiltrated into India at the command of the Inter-Services Intelligence Agency of Pakistan to kill election candidates and to intimidate voters?": "Atal",
  "Intelligence is sexy. Don't play dumb, especially young girls. Don't play dumb. And let people see that you are intelligent.": "Iman",
  "For something that's supposed to be secret, there is a lot of intelligence history. Every time I read one book, two more are published.": "Alan",
  "Without - you know, good intelligence stops plots against the homeland. Without that intelligence, we cannot effectively stop it.": "Mike",
  "Everyone on the Left has a favorite story that allows them to kind of excuse Reagan, explain away Reagan, say he was dumb, but unless we reckon with that kind of emotional intelligence and his ability to kind of speak to the aspirations of the American people, the less liberals are going to be able to understand the soul of his appeal.": "Rick",
  "Whatever you think about his intelligence, what's unquestionable is that Reagan had extraordinary emotional intelligence. He could sense the temperature of a room, and tell them a story and make them feel good. And that's more fun, right? It's more fun to feel good than feel bad. That's part of our human state.": "Rick",
  "Reagan's emotional intelligence, his ability to suss out people's longings and to channel them for political purposes, was better than just about any human being that ever lived.": "Rick",
  "Sometimes James Bond movies drive me crazy. They're fun to watch, but they don't have anything to do at all with what intelligence officers really do.": "David",
  "Intelligence services exist to do things that are illegal abroad. They exist to tell lies.": "David",
  "We have a complicated intelligence relationship with France. We have a complicated intelligence relationship with other - with other allies.": "David",
  "Europeans don't like to talk about intelligence, and they often pretend their countries don't spy.": "David",
  "I have been a systems engineer, systems administrator, a senior adviser for the Central Intelligence Agency, a solutions consultant and a telecommunications information systems officer.": "Edward",
  "You can't come forward against the world's most powerful intelligence agencies and be completely free from risk.": "Edward",
  "For books I want to keep reading, it's definitely the voice. It must be a voice I've never heard before, and it must have its own particular intelligence. By 'voice,' I don't mean vernacular. It has to have its own particular history and world that it inhabits.": "Amy",
  "I've seen a few wild grizzly bears, mostly in Alaska and British Columbia, and always from a distance. But each grizzly I've caught sight of was as fearsome and sublime as the last. You never get used to their raw power and massive bodies, or the mysterious intelligence in their dark, close-set eyes.": "Lydia",
  "I don't intend to simply go away and write my plays and be a good boy. I intend to remain an independent and political intelligence in my own right.": "Harold",
  "To young people born under the weird planet of the SAT, intelligence was equated with agility, with raw acuity. It produced a certain sort of person of which I was a typical specimen: the mental contortionist, able to rise to almost every challenge placed before him, except the challenge of real self-knowledge.": "Walter",
  "I am concerned that the vague guidelines and policies used by the NSA for intelligence collection and sharing, in conjunction with elusive direction from the Administration, have led to intelligence being collected on sitting members of Congress for political purposes.": "Ron",
  "It's part of a writer's profession, as it's part of a spy's profession, to prey on the community to which he's attached, to take away information - often in secret - and to translate that into intelligence for his masters, whether it's his readership or his spy masters. And I think that both professions are perhaps rather lonely.": "John",
  "It's necessary to understand what real intelligence work is. It will never cease. It's absolutely essential that we have it. At its best, it is simply the left arm of healthy governmental curiosity. It brings to a strong government what it needs to know. It's the collection of information, a journalistic job, if you will, but done in secret.": "John",
  "I wrote 'The Spy Who Came in from the Cold' at the age of 30 under intense, unshared personal stress and in extreme privacy. As an intelligence officer in the guise of a junior diplomat at the British Embassy in Bonn, I was a secret to my colleagues, and much of the time to myself.": "John",
  "I've had nothing to do with the intelligence world since I left it, in any shade or variety.": "John",
  "There's a lot of neuroscience now raising the question, 'Is all the intelligence in the human body in the brain?', and they're finding out that, no, it's not like that. The body has intelligence itself, and we're much more of an organic creature in that way.": "Joel",
  "The hard reality is that attacks by vehicles in public places are very hard to defend against in a free and open society. The best defense against such attacks is good intelligence, and that often comes from inside the Muslim community.": "Peter",
  "An intelligence officer and historian, Rayburn published a 2014 book, 'Iraq After America,' which is a must-read for anyone who wants to understand how Iraq descended into chaos in the years after the American troop withdrawal at the end of 2011.": "Peter",
  "The senior director at the NSC for the Middle East is retired Col. Derek Harvey, an Arabic-speaking intelligence officer with a Ph.D. who served as the head of the U.S. military cell examining the insurgency in Iraq in 2003.": "Peter",
  "Nothing is more dreadful than private duels in America. The two adversaries attack each other like wild beasts. Then it is that they might well covet those wonderful properties of the Indians of the prairies - their quick intelligence, their ingenious cunning, their scent of the enemy.": "Jules",
  "I came in as an engineer and worked on artificial intelligence at Google. I worked on related sites and matching advertising to queries with some of our earliest ads.": "Marissa",
  "If you make something, it's an artifact. It's something that somebody or some corporate entity has caused to come into being. A great many human beings have thought about each of the artifacts that surround us. Different degrees of intelligence and attention have been brought to bear on anything.": "William",
  "Of course it is a very simple matter to identify genes which might modify intelligence or memory and start thinking about whether you want to enhance a human, and the next generation is going to have to deal with that issue. Should we be trying to enhance humans rather than trying to educate them and so on?": "Robert",
  "I don't deny that there are problems in the intelligence world, but I would argue that in the UK we try to uphold the highest standards in the world.": "William",
  "People in charge of intelligence are political as well.": "Rick",
  "The intelligence community does not have complete 'eyes on' the totality of the Iranian nuclear program, nor can it guarantee that we have identified all of Iran's nuclear facilities and processes.": "Michael",
  "The president says, 'What difference does it make what you call the enemy?' Are you kidding me? As an intelligence officer, I would never get away with that. I could never say, 'Well, you know, boss, I don't label this enemy that we're facing.'": "Michael",
  "There is no greater evidence of superior intelligence than to be surprised at nothing.": "Josh",
  "If you are going to have to play defense all the time, you cannot have the kind of ingenuity, assertiveness, independence, and intelligence which is what has made our country strong.": "Arlen",
  "The wrongful arrest of tens of thousands of British Muslims after the September 11 attacks can be explained by the very poor intelligence the police had, and, just possibly, excused by the fact that a terrorist action in Britain linked to British Muslims would have been hugely damaging.": "Geoff",
  "Despite the obvious intelligence and security failures that contributed to the attack against the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, the reality is that in one night, an al Qaeda-affiliated group destroyed a diplomatic post, killed a U.S. ambassador and three other Americans, and forced an end to clandestine U.S. activity in the area.": "Jack",
  "I have a close association with Gen. Petraeus... What you get in Dave Petraeus is a very unique officer, a combination of intelligence, extraordinary depth of knowledge and understanding.": "Jack",
  "The homegrown terrorists are the most significant because any fighter returning from Syria to the United States would likely be identified and detected by our intelligence and law enforcement agencies.": "Jack",
  "All the things that made us basically nasty, rapacious, competitive as a species are not necessarily hard-coded into whatever passes for the DNA of artificial intelligence.": "Robert",
  "It's possible that there is a guiding intelligence in our universe. I don't see a lot of personal evidence for an interventionist-on-an-individual-basis-deity. I have friends who very much do believe in that. But I don't.": "Robert",
  "Our culture already has a number of well known stories about artificial life and non-human intelligence. In 'Exegesis,' I've tried to not only tell a new and engaging story but also to comment on those well known stories through the details of my novel.": "Astro",
  "In my experience as CEO, I found that the most important decisions tested my courage far more than my intelligence.": "Ben",
  "If you look at life with any honesty and intelligence, it's clear that human nature is dark, vile, selfish, and despondent. But I also see a force in human nature, namely grace, that sometimes works against our natural moral entropy.": "Scott",
  "If Reagan had intelligence information that showed that the upheaval in Egypt is actually Democratic in spirit, then he would have, I believe, turned his back on Mubarak, even though there's a long friendship between the United States and Egypt.": "Douglas",
  "For something to be completely evil is to be nothing. Satan has good attributes - intelligence, for instance - but they are corrupted. I cannot reconcile myself emotionally to alternative understandings of evil.": "Scott",
  "Lady Gaga has a very unjaded intelligence. It's brilliant, 'cause it's anti-snob.": "Mika",
  "When I was working on 'Homeland,' there was a consultant who helped me a lot... I went to Washington and met with my consultant there, and he actually organised a lunch with several people from the Intelligence Committee.": "Miranda",
  "There are so many successful women working in intelligence, but it's still seen as a male-dominated world.": "Miranda",
  "Intelligence work in the Marine Corps proved to me the strategic value in establishing a Central Command to act as a clearinghouse for disparate bits and floating bytes of information.": "Todd",
  "The problem lies with us: we've become addicted to experts. We've become addicted to their certainty, their assuredness, their definitiveness, and in the process, we have ceded our responsibility, substituting our intellect and our intelligence for their supposed words of wisdom.": "Noreena",
  "If we wander around as politicians jumping at every shadow and desperately afraid of having our words taken out of context or attacks layered on in an unfair way, I think we're actually doing a disrespect to Canadians, to people's intelligence.": "Justin",
  "In America, you have the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. You've got drones now being considered for domestic surveillance. You have the National Security Agency building the world's giantest spy center.": "Heather",
  "I think America is less safe on a lot fronts, and I disagree with the release of the information from Dianne Feinstein. I think she's as much a traitor to this country at this point as I thought about Edward Snowden and his release of information about other investigations and abilities from an intelligence standpoint.": "Jeff",

  "If little else, the brain is an educational toy.": "Tom",
  "Many things matter other than our measured intelligence, so let's get to work on them.": "Angela",
  "Barack Obama is probably one of the brightest in terms of sheer intelligence... also probably the best orator we've ever had as a president.": "Mario",
  "It should tell you something that Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI) agency invented the Taliban in the early 1990s only because Hekmatyar, its primary U.S.-bankrolled proxy in the war for control of Afghanistan, had proved too bloodthirsty after the Soviets withdrew, even by the low standards of the ISI's ghastly generals in Rawalpindi.": "Terry",
  "Like many intellectuals, he was incapable of saying a simple thing in a simple way.": "Marcel",
  "Savvy companies are quietly changing up their boards of directors and teams, and this is giving them better collective intelligence, more community admiration, and better financial results.": "Aileen",
  "My personal sources in the intelligence community and the military are very good. They're excellent. I have very high-up, in-depth sources.": "Peter",
  "It's really difficult to navigate attention and stardom and celebrity status and still try to maintain yourself and hold onto your intelligence and integrity. It's really challenging.": "Shirley",
  "Ian Fleming was my cousin, you know. He was in naval intelligence.": "Christopher",
  "In terms of environmental impact, Samasource jobs are very green. Our product is human intelligence, and it's transported through the Internet rather than via carbon-intensive trucking, shipping, and warehousing.": "Leila",
  "One may have broad or narrow talents, but only education renders them useful. Schools set up to train people will develop the intelligence of those who have it and end the stupidity of those who do not, providing a specialty to those who have narrow talent and broad knowledge to those with all-around ability.": "Sun",
  "My father was always slightly bemused by my success. Although he knew that I had reasonable intelligence, he always thought that I was a little bit lazy.": "Terry",
  "Just as you should never confuse the law with common justice, intelligence should not be confused with common sense. Some of the brightest people in the world have no idea how to cross the road.": "Terry",
  "Advertising isn't just the disruption of aesthetics, the insults to your intelligence and the interruption of your train of thought. At every company that sells ads, a significant portion of their engineering team spends their day tuning data mining, writing better code to collect all your personal data.": "Jan",

  "A John Updike is a once-in-a-generation phenomenon, if that generation is lucky: so comfortable in so many genres, the same lively, generous intelligence suffusing all he did.": "George",
  "In Don Mills in the Sixties, nothing comes close to the humiliation of losing an argument. In our weird little creative circle, no one cares who has faster fists, but to lose an argument suggests inferior intelligence.": "Dan",
  "One thing I have seen over and over again in life is that there is virtually no correlation between intelligence and common sense. IQ doesn't seem to translate that way.": "Vincent",
  "As a trial lawyer, intelligence is important only in the sense that it allows you to play the game, if you will. Without it, you don't even have a ticket into the competitive arena. But beyond that, it doesn't get you very far at all.": "Vincent",
  "The media has zero integrity, zero intelligence, and no hard work. You're the opposition party. Not the Democratic Party. You're the opposition party. The media's the opposition party.": "Stephen",

  "We will have to continue to improve our human intelligence system-something that was, unfortunately, lacking in the years which led up to September 11. This is going to be a continuing process of change.": "John",
  "When student performance shows increases on test scores, that improvement is not associated with an increase in 'fluid intelligence' - that is, using logical thinking and problem solving in novel situations, rather than recalling previously learned facts and skills.": "Randi",
  "Intelligence is quickness to apprehend as distinct form ability, which is capacity to act wisely on the thing apprehended.": "Alfred",
  "It takes an extraordinary intelligence to contemplate the obvious.": "Alfred",

  "There's been intelligence that terrorists would look to programs such as the visa waiver program to exploit.": "Asa",
  "The 21st century - and the atheists - needs the presence of religion, just as religion must deal with the real challenges and the thinkers of the day in order to sharpen the conscience and the intelligence of those who study the timeless sacred texts in a spirit of responding to the questions of their time.": "Tariq",
  "Cultures are never merely intellectual constructs. They take form through the collective intelligence and memory, through a commonly held psychology and emotions, through spiritual and artistic communion.": "Tariq",
  "In order to be successful against each of these threats, we have to have a presence overseas, work closely not only with our counterparts in the law enforcement community, but also with the intelligence community.": "Robert",

  "There'll be differences of opinion in just about every intelligence analysis that you make.": "Robert",
  "I like shows that have some level of intelligence to them. When it's not as predictable, when you don't know what's coming at you.": "Mehmet",
  "If you don't have a job right now, and you have a computer and a basic intelligence level, I guarantee you can get a great job, paying really well, in less than three months. How? Learn to program.": "Tucker",
  "Because hip-hop has no requirements, you deal with people that have the least intelligence on the planet. Some of the people that compare themselves to me, compare themselves to me because they rap and I rap. They can't even read the contracts that they sign to be a rapper, to do the deal.": "Curtis",
  "Well look, CIA is an agency that has to collect intelligence, do operations. We have to take risks and it's important that we take risks and that we know that we have the support of the government and we have the support of the American people in what we're doing.": "Leon",
  "You know, as director of the CIA, I got an awful lot of intelligence about all the horrible things that could go on across the world.": "Leon",
  "It is only when you watch the dense mass of thousands of ants, crowded together around the Hill, blackening the ground, that you begin to see the whole beast, and now you observe it thinking, planning, calculating. It is an intelligence, a kind of live computer, with crawling bits for its wits.": "Lewis",
  "I will not, nor will I ever, publicly divulge sensitive intelligence sources and methods. For when that happens, our national security is endangered and lives can be lost.": "John",
  "I do not - I never believed it's better to kill a terrorist than to detain him. We want to detain as many terrorists as possible so we can elicit the intelligence from them in the appropriate manner so that we can disrupt follow-on terrorist attacks.": "John",
  "The actions that we take on the counterterrorism front, again, are to take actions against individuals where we believe that the intelligence base is so strong and the nature of the threat is so grave and serious, as well as imminent, that we have no recourse except to take this action that may involve a lethal strike.": "John",
  "While the intelligence profession oftentimes demands secrecy, it is critically important that there be a full and open discourse on intelligence matters with the appropriate elected representatives of the American people.": "John",
  "We are in this business, whether it be intelligence or the government, to protect freedom, democracy and liberty, not to violate that.": "John",
  "As a former career intelligence professional, I have a profound appreciation for the value of intelligence. Intelligence disrupts terrorist plots and thwarts attacks. Intelligence saves lives.": "John",
  "Simply stated, the need for accurate intelligence and prescient analysis from CIA has never been greater than it is in 2013 - or than it will be in the coming years.": "John",
  "We will use all lawful tools at our disposal, and that includes authorities under the renewed PATRIOT Act. We firmly believe that our intelligence gathering tools must enable us to collect the information we need to protect the American people.": "John",
  "I think all governments engage in intelligence gathering vis-a-vis other governments.": "Henry",
  "There's no training for the business, no credentials necessary to enter... It's all about entrepreneurs, innate street intelligence, and instincts. It's a business which encourages people with dreams. That's the essence of Hollywood.": "Dawn",
  "I know from my own experience that there is much more to 'intelligence' than an IQ number. In fact, I hesitate to believe that any system could really reflect the complexity and uniqueness of one person's mind, or meaningfully describe the nature of his or her potential.": "Daniel",
  "White House leaks of classified information put the lives of U.S. service members, intelligence officers, and civilians at risk. That's why I support a measure passed by the Senate Intelligence Committee to crack down on such leaks.": "Peter",
  "The president has a right to discuss his national security policies with the public. But that should be done in the light of day without endangering our sources or methods. The public has no need to know details about intelligence assets or special operations units. Such disclosures endanger those who protect us.": "Peter",
  "No man likes to have his intelligence or good faith questioned, especially if he has doubts about it himself.": "Henry",
  "There is no such thing as an underestimate of average intelligence.": "Henry",
  "It is impossible to underrate human intelligence - beginning with one's own.": "Henry",
  "Most good actors have a huge intelligence about the human condition and a real open heart to different kinds of people and behavior.": "Tim",
  "In the music industry, intelligence in women is undervalued.": "Bat",
  "With the headset and motion tracker and all kinds of different future tracking technologies that we are R&Ding, there is just a huge amount of intelligence that has to be created. So we are looking at hiring some of the brightest minds out there to tackle some of those challenges and deliver the very best experience possible for the consumer.": "Brendan",
  "There are physical characteristics which are inherited. These include things like good looks, high intelligence, physical coordination. These attributes contribute to success in life, and success in life is a determinant of optimism.": "Martin",
  "An aria in an opera - Handel's 'Ombra mai fu,' for example - gets along with an incredibly small number of words and ideas and a large amount of variation and repetition. That's the beauty of it. It's not taxing to the listener's intelligence because if you haven't heard it the first time round, it'll come around again.": "James",
  "The case for exploiting animals for food, clothing and entertainment often relies on our superior intelligence, language and self-awareness: the rights of the superior being trump those of the inferior.": "Michael",
  "Expressive speech, with modulation in pitch and volume, and a minimum of noticeable pauses, boosts credibility and enhances the impression of intelligence.": "Leonard",
  "The intelligence community gets hurt through sequestration.": "Lindsey",
  "According to the FBI and the director of national intelligence, Syria's becoming a perfect platform to strike our nation. I've got a very simple strategy as your president against ISIL. Whatever it takes, as long as it takes, to defeat them.": "Lindsey",
  "My great-grandfather was a man of great vision, drive, and native intelligence, with some human flaws amplified by limited education, limited social range, and questionable influence from some of his advisers.": "William",
  "Hamlet is an astonishing intelligence.": "Ben",
  "Well, I think there's a distinction between sexing-up the intelligence and sexing-up the presentation of the intelligence.": "John",
  "Novelists get to say plenty in their massive tomes; rock singers only get four-minute songs with two verses and a chorus' worth of lyrics, and so there's a real pleasure in accessing the intelligence behind the music, even if it doesn't qualify as 'great literature.'": "Karan",
  "True intelligence requires fabulous imagination.": "Ian",
  "I apologize for being obvious, but every time I watch the curtain come down on even a halfway decent production of a Shakespeare play I feel a little sorrowful that I'll never know the man, or any man of such warm intelligence.": "Ian",
  "Perhaps measuring animal intelligence by comparing it to human intelligence isn't the best litmus test.": "Ingrid",
  "There is little evidence that our individual intelligence has improved through recorded history.": "James",
  "The whole macho thing has to be reexamined. Because in my view, the Bush administration was weak, not strong. To engage in a policy of torture is a weak policy. Because ultimately, it encourages the terrorists. It undermines our own values. It corrupts our system. And it doesn't get good intelligence.": "Alex",
  "Too many problem-solving sessions become battlegrounds where decisions are made based on power rather than intelligence.": "Margaret",
  "Successful organizations, including the Military, have learned that the higher the risk, the more necessary it is to engage everyone's commitment and intelligence.": "Margaret",
  "I have great faith in the intelligence of the American viewer and reader to put two and two together and come up with four.": "Jim",
  "I mean, we must act with intelligence. We must work on this framework, so that immigration becomes an asset to both nations. Believe me, what - just the Mayor Bloomberg said here in New York, that this city would be stopped, totally stopped if it were not by the immigrants working here.": "Vicente",
  "I've always been a big Cate Blanchett fan. Such a wonderful role model, the way she carries herself through her profession. She has so much grace to her, and so much intelligence. I've also always been a big Katharine Hepburn fan.": "Elizabeth",
  "Poets are the sense, philosophers the intelligence of humanity.": "Samuel",
  "After all, it is the divinity within that makes the divinity without; and I have been more fascinated by a woman of talent and intelligence, though deficient in personal charms, than I have been by the most regular beauty.": "Washington",
  "In the future, I think it's pretty plausible that collective intelligence tools and skills will be important in order to be a part of global dialog, global business, and global creativity. People who know how to negotiate collective intelligence networks are going to be in a good position to contribute to global society.": "Jane",
  "We are moving towards a new form of collective intelligence.": "Jane",
  "I've always wanted to be a spy, and frankly I'm a little surprised that British intelligence has never approached me.": "Elizabeth",
  "The 9/11 commission recommended the appointment of a national intelligence director with budgetary authority to better coordinate the work of the intelligence community and resolve differences.": "Ronald",
  "Because of the terrorist threat, the FBI and CIA have become as important as the military in preserving our freedom. Yet while thanking our military is standard practice in American life, no one thinks of thanking the FBI, the CIA, or the rest of the intelligence community for keeping us safe since 9/11.": "Ronald",
  "The way you speak should not determine your intelligence. I should be able to say 'lit,' and you still know I'm intelligent. I should be able to say 'turn up,' and that doesn't take away from my intelligence. I wanted to break down that stereotype a little bit.": "Angie",
  "It was my mother's idea. Her feeling was that I didn't have the intelligence to pick a trade myself.": "Vidal",
  "We need to look to our laurels a bit with television in this country. I don't think enough risks are being taken in drama television in the U.K., and I think a lot of programme makers are underestimating the intelligence of the viewing public, basing it all on ratings.": "Charles",
  "I've always been fascinated by intelligence and how our brains work, and how they can be improved.": "Clare",
  "We've sweated and torn out our hair trying to reconstruct our chosen lives, to fashion them like literary sculptures, at once monumental and yet human. We've applied all of our intelligence, our empathy, our critical faculties, our compassion - and we think, in our delusion, that it's still 1960, and our work is going to get noticed.": "Nigel",
  "The Clinton White House today said they would start to give national security and intelligence briefings to George Bush. I don't know how well this is working out. Today after the first one Bush said, 'I've got one question: What color is the red phone?'": "Bill",
  "The No. 1 thing I am earnestly attracted to is intelligence.": "Rachel",
  "For the several thousands of years before they became firefighters and physicians, women were sirens, enchantresses, snares. At times it seems as if female powerlessness is male self-preservation in disguise. And for millennia, this has made for a zero-sum game: A woman's intelligence was a man's deception.": "Stacy",
  "So many people say that obviously my game has changed since I arrived here and I say that it's good that it changed, otherwise it would show a lack of intelligence.": "Thierry",
  "Our culture has long mistrusted the body. It's been seen as a confusing blend of God's handiwork and the devil's playground. It is, rather, a vortex of intelligence.": "Victoria",

  "A German immersed in any civilization different from his own loses a weight equivalent in volume to the amount of intelligence he displaces.": "Jose",

  "Some of the best fan mail I get are from our men and women in the military and intelligence communities. They say, 'Boy you do your homework, this is exactly how we're doing it.'": "Brad",
  "I want to exude strength and intelligence.": "Portia",
  "Though intelligence is powerless to modify character, it is a dab hand at finding euphemisms for its weaknesses.": "Quentin",
  "A person must have a certain amount of intelligent ignorance to get anywhere.": "Charles",
  "By the 2030s, the nonbiological portion of our intelligence will predominate.": "Ray",
  "Your personality as the prime minister feeds through to what you emphasise, and what you don't, how you'll handle a situation - whether you've got the combination of intelligence or instincts to adapt and to make good decisions.": "John",
  "The war on terror, I believe, will be waged by effective intelligence and police work and cruise missiles.": "Michael",
  "The assumption is that the right kind of society is an organic being not merely analogous to an organic being, but actually a living structure with appetites and digestions, instincts and passions, intelligence and reason.": "Herbert",
  "It is an accepted commonplace in psychology that the spiritual level of people acting as a crowd is far lower than the mean of each individual's intelligence or morality.": "Christian",
  "I found that, academically, it really didn't matter whether I had received a certain grade in a class; it didn't matter too much what schools I wanted to attend... What matters is one's drive, one's intelligence.": "Jon",
  "I was an English major at the University of Minnesota, and I was very shy, which many people misinterpreted as intelligence. On the basis of that wrong impression, I became the editor of the campus literary magazine.": "Garrison",
  "An organization's intelligence is distributed to the point of being ubiquitous.": "Kevin",
  "Elia Kazan understood my problems. He was able to bring out the very best in me. He gave me credit for my intelligence.": "Ethel",
  "It would be incredibly presumptuous and self-serving of me to believe that Facebook was the end of history. The only way it could possibly be the end of history is if it becomes some sort of artificial super intelligence that takes over the world.": "Sean",
  "My mum is a bit unconventional; she's outdoorsy and has more of an emotional intelligence, whereas my dad is pragmatic; he's a businessman.": "Tamsin",
  "I have met with some of them - very honest fellows, who, with all their stupidity, had a kind of intelligence and an upright good sense, which cannot be the characteristics of fools.": "Giacomo",
  "A great many people think that polysyllables are a sign of intelligence.": "Barbara",
  "Many difficulties which nature throws in our way, may be smoothed away by the exercise of intelligence.": "Livy",
  "The employer class is less indispensable in the modern organization of industries because the laboring men themselves possess sufficient intelligence to organize into co-operative relation and enjoy the entire benefits of their own labor.": "Leland",
  "When I was the director of Central Intelligence in the early '90s, I tried to get the Air Force to partner with us in building drones. And they didn't want to, because they had no pilots.": "Robert",
  "There is huge demand for artificial intelligence technologies.": "Yuri",
  "There is no greater privilege in living than bringing a tiny new human being into the world and then trying to raise him or her properly during the next eighteen years. Doing that job right requires all the intelligence, wisdom, and determination you will be able to muster from day to day.": "James",
  "It is difficult, if not impossible, to argue that laws written in the 1970s are adequate for today's intelligence challenges.": "Bob",
  "U.S. intelligence has the legal right to monitor foreign communications as they go through to U.S. service providers. However, even though something is legal doesn't make it right. I'm not American; I don't really care about what data is being collected about American citizens. I'm worried about us, the foreigners.": "Mikko",
  "It's high time for a fresh European alternative to enter the market, taking the existing Internet behemoths head on. What the world needs now is a cloud storage service that is not subject to uncontrolled access by intelligence agencies.": "Mikko",
  "The United States has an unfair advantage, as most of the popular cloud services, search engines, computer and mobile operating systems or web browsers are made by U.S. companies. When the rest of the world uses the net, they are effectively using U.S.-based services, making them a legal target for U.S. intelligence.": "Mikko",
  "Stuxnet, Duqu and Flame are not normal, everyday malware, of course. All three of them were most likely developed by a Western intelligence agency as part of covert operations that weren't meant to be discovered. The fact that the malware evaded detection proves how well the attackers did their job.": "Mikko",
  "In most job interviews, people say they are looking for people skills and emotional intelligence. That's reasonable, but the question is, how do you define what that looks like?": "Susan",
  "Remember to be as smart as you are.": "Judd",
  "Instinct perfected is a faculty of using and even constructing organized instruments intelligence perfected is the faculty of making and using unorganized instruments.": "Henri",
  "I don't know how to depict intelligence.": "David",
  "God is another name for human intelligence raised above all error and imperfection, and extended to all possible truth.": "William",
  "They say military have the so-called 'secret intelligence' - this amount of intelligence must be very secret, since I've never seen any intelligent military person, nor I have seen any sense in the bloody stupid wars.": "Ozzy",
  "I spent over 10 years in the Central Intelligence Agency, serving overseas, serving in the Middle East. And let me tell you, if you're a terrorist and you want to come to the United States, the worst possible way to do it is as a refugee. You'll go through a year and a half to two years of vetting.": "Evan",
  "I spent over ten years in the Central Intelligence Agency as an undercover operations officer serving overseas after 9/11 where I carried out covert operations against al-Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as other countries who are 'hostile to liberty,' as I like to say.": "Evan",
  "If there is anyone who should not be trusted with regard to intelligence, it is Donald Trump, both in the literal sense and with regard to our intelligence services. He shouldn't have access to these briefings.": "Evan",
  "There is no question that creative intelligence comes not through learning things you find in books or histories that have already been written, but by focusing on and giving value to experience as it happens.": "Antony",
  "When you think of intelligence, don't think of a college professor; think of human beings as opposed to chimpanzees. If you don't have human intelligence, you're not even in the game.": "Eliezer",
  "We tend to see individual differences instead of human universals. Thus, when someone says the word 'intelligence,' we think of Einstein instead of humans.": "Eliezer",
  "Since the rise of Homo sapiens, human beings have been the smartest minds around. But very shortly - on a historical scale, that is - we can expect technology to break the upper bound on intelligence that has held for the last few tens of thousands of years.": "Eliezer",
  "I am a full-time Research Fellow at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a small 501(c)(3) public charity supported primarily by individual donations.": "Eliezer",
  "I keep trying to explain to people that the archetype of intelligence is not Dustin Hoffman in 'The Rain Man;' it is a human being, period. It is squishy things that explode in a vacuum, leaving footprints on their moon.": "Eliezer",
  "The House Intelligence Committee and the Senate Intelligence Committee are investigating everything having to do with Russia, and I expect we will find there is nothing there when it comes to the Trump campaign.": "Ronna",
  "These are Canadian and United States intelligence and law enforcement offices who are working in teams and who are using good intelligence and good law enforcement to really stop the criminals and terrorists before they ever get to the border.": "Paul",
  "I can tell you that the Canadian intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been providing outstanding co-operation with our intelligence and law enforcement agencies as we work together to track down terrorists here in North America and put them out of commission.": "Paul",
  "I'm the chairman of the intelligence committee. We don't only get formal briefings, but we collect our information from the intelligence community in a variety of ways.": "Mike",
  "Intelligence is playing a more important role in policymaker decisions than I think I've ever seen in my time in Congress or before.": "Mike",
  "The idea of harnessing the intelligence of the readership has been lost in the quest for Facebook likes. For many, readers have become synonymous with hateful commenters. It's time for a renewed push to realize some of the original dreams of the web.": "Nick",
  "The key thing about force protection is... if you focus too much on force protection, and you disengage yourself from the community, you're putting yourself at greater risk because you need to interact with the community in a positive way to gain the intelligence you need.": "H.",
  "I don't underestimate audiences' intelligence. Audiences are much brighter than media gives them credit for. When people went to a movie once a week in the 1930s and that was their only exposure to media, you were required to do a different grammar.": "Michael",
  "I can't see what's wrong about assuming intelligence in your audience and what's bad news about being rewarded for assuming that.": "Steven",
  "Chess is as elaborate a waste of human intelligence as you can find outside an advertising agency.": "Raymond",
  "I don't want to talk about intelligence matters. I will say, however, that intelligence-community estimates should not become public in the way of this city and in the way of Congress.": "Warren",
  "The United States has done more for the war crimes tribunal than any other country in the world. We're turning over all the information we have, including intelligence information.": "Warren",
  "Men create real miracles when they use their God-given courage and intelligence.": "Jean",
  "Synths are a very low level of artificial intelligence. Whereas you have a Stradivarius that will live for a thousand years.": "Thomas",
  "But some actors I have met possess an intelligence that I can only dream of. It's about character, it's about behavior. They understand things about people that I simply don't see.": "Ron",
  "Everyone I know who used to be in the intelligence community is moving into the corporate world.": "Tony",
  "Since September 11th Congress has created the Department of Homeland Security, more than doubled the homeland security budget and implemented a bipartisan overhaul of our intelligence systems.": "Doc",
  "People are what you make them. A scornful look turns into a complete fool a man of average intelligence. A contemptuous indifference turns into an enemy a woman who, well treated, might have been an angel.": "Andre",
  "You can't get closer to the heart of national sovereignty than national security and intelligence services.": "Gijs",
  "There is a lot of strength and intelligence in Hollywood.": "Fay",

  "The Intelligence Committee will also examine present counterintelligence programs for the Department of Energy, the National Laboratories, and the Department of Defense.": "Charles",
  "I sought Ben Affleck because I needed an everyman for this role. Ben appeals to men and women. He gives you a sense of intelligence, the notion of a guy who can think on his feet.": "John",
  "In the fight against terrorism, national agencies keep full control over their police forces, security and intelligence agencies and judicial authorities.": "Gijs",
  "The CIA teamed up with Army, Air Force and Naval Intelligence to run one of the most nefarious, classified, enhanced interrogation programs of the Cold War. The work took place inside a clandestine facility in the American zone of occupied Germany, called Camp King.": "Annie",
  "Oprah is so bright, and her intelligence is so piercing that I don't think anyone who spends a few minutes with her isn't struck by that.": "Victoria",
  "The war we are fighting today against terrorism is a multifaceted fight. We have to use every tool in our toolkit to wage this war - diplomacy, finance, intelligence, law enforcement, and of course, military power - and we are developing new tools as we go along.": "Richard",
  "When I resigned, I put the U.S. Government on notice that I'm going to stick to policy issues, that I have no intention of going out and blowing the cover off of the intelligence operations, that those are truly sensitive and they should not be exposed.": "Scott",
  "As Prime Minister Netanyahu and Defense Minister Barak have repeatedly said, the intelligence and security relationship between the United States and Israel at present is unprecedented. It has never been stronger.": "Susan",
  "The intelligence community agrees 30 percent of the terrorists released from Guantanamo are known or suspected to have already re-joined the fight against Americans_- a statistic that translates to a horrific reality.": "Mark",
  "Daniel Goleman has proven that two-thirds of the success in business is based upon our Emotional Intelligence as opposed to our IQ or our level of experience. As we look for the next crop of future CEOs, maybe it's time for America's corporations to start interviewing grads from the psychology master's programs rather than the M.B.A. programs.": "Chip",
  "The president doesn't order the military to seize political opponents. He doesn't order his intelligence community to lie about national security for political purposes. He uses the military or intelligence communities to protect the United States and our citizens, not to help him win elections.": "Kathleen",
  "Wormholes don't exist because the only way they would exist is if they were seeded with exotic material created by an intelligence far beyond our own. Something would have to make one.": "Jonathan",
  "One of the things we found out as we filmed with people who dealt with chimps, and with all animals, and it's really incredible, is their levels of intelligence that we don't recognize right away.": "D.",
  "Would it not be much better to have a president who deliberately lied to the people because he thought a war was essential than to have one who was so dumb as to be taken in by intelligence agencies, especially those who told him what he wanted to hear?": "Andrew",
  "For some, the very act of intelligence gathering seems illegitimate when applied to the crime of terrorism.": "Raymond",
  "You have multiple intelligence agencies. They all ultimately report to the director of national intelligence but, you know, it never comes in neat packages. So you have to make judgments on what you have, and it's not easy to do.": "Raymond",
  "The ability to take pleasure in one's life is a skill and is a kind of intelligence. So intelligence is a hard thing to evaluate and it manifests itself in so many different ways. I do think the ability to know how to live a life and not be miserable is a sign of that.": "Todd",
  "In reality, serial killers are of average intelligence.": "Pat",
  "Following 9/11, intelligence indicated numerous links between al-Qa'eda and Algeria. It began to look as though the roots of jihad could be traced back to the war in Algeria that began 50 years ago.": "Alistair",
  "I take four planes a week, honestly. You know, I am for intelligence screening.": "Aaron",
  "That penetrating gaze, that intelligence; it's hard not to be anthropomorphic when you're looking at a great ape - at any primate - but especially with gorillas. They're just so magnificent.": "K.",
  "It is conceded by all that man is the very highest type of all living creatures on the earth. His intelligence is far superior to that of any other earthly being.": "Joseph",
  "But our society does not grant nontraditional forms of intelligence equal recognition, no matter how much it would help us get along or truly enrich our lives.": "Joan",
  "Guantanamo allows us to secure dangerous detainees without the risk of escape, while at the same time providing us with valuable intelligence information on how best to proceed in the war against terror and prevent future attacks.": "Jim",
  "It takes intelligence to make real comedy, and it takes a reality base to create all that little stuff I like to do that makes you giggle inside.": "Chris",
  "Some ways of using our thinking are really inspiring. There are people who use their thinking to race cars. People use their thinking to build rockets to the moon. It's all just a use of your thinking.": "Michael",
  "Schools are not intended to moralize a wicked world, but to impart knowledge and develop intelligence, with only two social aims in mind: prepare to take on one's share in the world's work, and perhaps in addition, lend a hand in improving society, after schooling is done.": "Jacques",
  "Training and education is one and the same: that is, to train the mind through a discipline in order to awake the inner intelligence of the individuals.": "Lobsang",
  "The rare person is still interested in new advances when they are adults. There is possibly a correlation with intelligence. In any case, you have to be fairly bright to keep learning and changing attitudes as you get older.": "Keith",
  "I think what he's - what he believes, and he may be correct, I don't know, that we have some intelligence information that leads us to know some things about what's going on in Iraq that we haven't revealed to others.": "Lawrence",
  "In order to defend the Chinese race, one must first defend the Confucian culture; and in order to defend the Confucian culture, one must first defend the State. This is because what preserves the race relies upon intelligence, which is in turn nurtured by Confucian education.": "Zhang",
  "There never yet has been a country which became powerful without knowledge. A man by his own strength alone cannot successfully combat a tiger, but by his intelligence, he can devise means to entrap him.": "Zhang",
  "The number one thing I look for is personality. For me, the personality of someone makes them more and more attractive over time ... and for those with bad personalities, less and less attractive. I look for honesty, intelligence, kindness, and a good work ethic, to name a few.": "Manika",
  "Our intentions may be very good, but, because the intelligence is limited, the action may turn out to be a mistake - a mistake, but not necessarily a sin, for sin comes out of a wrong intention.": "E.",
  "I've always felt, in all my books, that there's a deep decency in the American people and a native intelligence - providing they have the facts, providing they have the information.": "Studs",
  "You'll remember Dr. Rice said that several times: It was not a warning about the place and the method and the time - it was a general warning. And that points out the imperfection, if you would, of our intelligence.": "Lee",
  "Terrorists continue to exploit divisions between law enforcement and the intelligence communities that limit the sharing of vital counterterrorism information.": "Jim",
  "But it is equally incontrovertible that if our intelligence gathering process is seriously flawed, we had better find out and find out fast if we are to avoid another Sept. 11.": "Adam",

  "The Germans certainly - the intelligence service believed that there were WMD. It turns out that we were all wrong, probably in my judgment, and that is most disturbing.": "David",
  "I have had national security background, 10 years on the Intelligence Committee, the last two years as chair.": "Bob",
  "We ought to recognize that we have an offensive responsibility to take the war to the terrorists where they are. That responsibility has waned in the last year as military and intelligence resources were withdrawn from Afghanistan and Pakistan to be used in Iraq.": "Bob",
  "We need to make a greater investment in human intelligence.": "Bob",
  "During the Cold War, we gathered information by listening to the Soviets, taking pictures of the Soviets, and we allowed our human intelligence to decline.": "Bob",
  "This president has been reluctant to hold anybody accountable. No one was held accountable after September the 11th. Nobody's been held accountable after the clear flaws in intelligence leading up to the war in Iraq.": "Bob",
  "The Patriot Act removed major legal barriers that prevented the law enforcement, intelligence, and national defense communities from talking and coordinating their work to protect the American people and our national security.": "Jon",
  "Someday we'll learn the whole story of why George W. Bush brushed off that intelligence briefing of Aug. 6, 2001, 'Bin Laden Determined to Strike in U.S.' But surely a big distraction was the major speech he was readying for delivery on Aug. 9, his first prime-time address to the nation.": "Frank",

  "I had been involved in U.S. intelligence in Berlin, Germany, while in the military and had worked with a contact with the Central Intelligence Agency office there.": "George",
  "We focus on a unique form of artificial intelligence called artificial swarm intelligence.": "Louis",
  "Beyond individual intelligence, nature has also cultivated intelligence through swarms. For example, bees, birds and fish act in a more intelligent way when acting together as a swarm, flock or school.": "Louis",
  "We developed a technology called artificial swarm intelligence, which is all about tapping the inherent knowledge, wisdom, intuition of groups.": "Louis",
  "When a species wants to tap the collective intelligence of a population, they don't take a poll; they don't take a vote. They form a real-time system.": "Louis",
  "Swarm intelligence is like a brain of brains.": "Louis",

  "We have no regulation of drones in the United States in their commercial use. You can see drones some day hovering over the homes of Hollywood luminaries, violating privacy.

  "It would help if human experts agreed on the meaning of such basic terms as intelligence, consciousness, or awareness. They don't. It's hard to build something that's incompletely defined.": "Edward",
  "Despite our very recent appearance on the planet, humanity combines arrogance with increasing material demands, even as we become more numerous. Our toughness is a delusion. Have we the intelligence and discipline to vigilantly guard against our tendency to grow without limit?": "Lynn",
  "The hijab, or sikh turban, or Jewish skullcap are all explicit symbols, but they do not represent a threat or affront to others, and have no bearing on the competence, skills and intelligence of a person.": "Randa",
  "In 'Chappie,' you see this sort of young robot that's learning through maybe 'deep learning' how to see the world really, look out into the world, and learn step by step. What's so interesting is that with 'Chappie,' you're getting to see how human behavior reacts to artificial intelligence, and I don't think it's always going to be positive.": "Gray",
  "I don't think that an artificially intelligent system that has superhuman intelligence will be violent. I do think that it will disrupt our culture.": "Gray",
  "One of the great intellectual failures of the American intelligence community, and especially the counterterrorism community, is to assume if someone hasn't attacked us, it's because he can't or because we've defeated him.": "Michael",

  "How can faceless bureaucrats in an intelligence agency deny brave soldiers a chance to tell the truth?": "Curt",
  "Well, our position, and our chairman has talked about this extensively, is that we had a lot of intelligence prior to 9/11. We knew that two al Qaeda operatives who ultimately participated in the 9/11 disaster were in the United States. We didn't find them.": "Richard",
  "In November, they transferred control of Abu Ghraib to the military intelligence command completely; it was, after all, the center for interrogations for Iraq.": "Janis",
  "The day after the prison was transferred to the military intelligence command, they had an entire battalion - 1,200, 1,500 soldiers - arrive at Abu Ghraib just for force protection alone.": "Janis",

  "My experience is the White House is not a very good place to coordinate intelligence, much less to integrate it.": "Dennis",

The American people are uncomfortable with government activities that do not take place in the open, subject to public scrutiny and review.": "Dennis",
  "Before 9/11 there were weak procedures, willingness, and mechanisms for communicating among agencies for foreign intelligence and the FBI with its focus on law enforcement. The domestic-vs.-foreign barrier has been solved by the reforms after 9/11 that established the DNI.": "Dennis",

  "I've always been baffled by critics of the CIA, who are horrified that it does illegal things. That is the purpose of an intelligence service: to perform illegal acts.": "Charles",
  "Richard M. Helms, the first director of Central Intelligence to rise from the ranks, was fond of saying that the CIA had been founded to make sure that there would never be another Pearl Harbor. Underlying this mission impossible was the wishful supposition that an America that knew everything could prevent anything.": "Charles",
  "I've consciously tried not to romanticize anything, especially not intelligence work. I've always said that I've been writing a series of episodic, naturalistic novels. The people just happen to be spies, politicians, civil servants.": "Charles",
  "I would argue that in any habitable zone that doesn't boil or freeze, intelligent life is going to emerge because intelligence is convergent.": "Simon",

  "When a decision is made to go to war based on intelligence, it is a fateful decision. It has ramifications and impacts way beyond the current months and years.": "Carl",

  "According to Richard Clarke, the former White House counterterrorism chief, Bush was so obsessed with Iraq that he failed to take action against Osama Bin Laden despite repeated warnings from his intelligence experts.": "Ferdinand",
  "I mean enormous pressure was brought to bear - Valerie Amos, Lady Amos, went round Africa with people from our intelligence services trying to press them. I had to make sure that we didn't promise a misuse of aid in a way that would be illegal.": "Clare",
  "I'm a first-time father, and it was amazing to me to learn that my son could actually use sign language before the spoken word. I could see this intelligence in his eyes before he could speak: how he could understand what was going on around him and was frustrated by that.": "Matt",

  "I can't be a man. But I can embrace the head of a man, the intelligence of a man, the spirit of a man.": "Linda",
  "All the teaching I had ever received had failed to make me apply such intelligence as I was possessed of, directly and vividly: there had never been any sunshine, as regards language, in the earlier grey days of learning, for the sky had always pelted with gerunds and optatives.": "E.",
  "It's more fun to write villains. They are more of a challenge, and I get a sick kind of pleasure out of delving into their minds. There's rarely emptiness, and there is almost always deep intelligence.": "Nnedi",
  "The intelligence community, for the most part, has no accountability at all; to the Congress, to us the American people, and so they feel that they above the law.": "Gloria",
  "Taste is the fundamental quality which sums up all the other qualities. It is the nec plus ultra of the intelligence. Through this alone is genius the supreme health and balance of all the faculties.": "Comte",

  "The Homeland Security department doesn't have tasking authority in the intelligence community. They can ask for stuff, but they can't direct anything except inside their bureau.": "David",
  "We are constantly protecting the male ego, and it's a disservice to men. If a man has any sensitivity or intelligence, he wants to get the straight scoop from his girlfriend.": "Betty",
  "The mind of man has perplexed itself with many hard questions. Is space infinite, and in what sense? Is the material world infinite in extent, and are all places within that extent equally full of matter? Do atoms exist or is matter infinitely divisible?": "James",
  "God does not require you to follow His leadings on blind trust. Behold the evidence of an invisible intelligence pervading everything, even your own mind and body.": "Raymond",
  "It doesn't matter that Bush scares the hell out of me. What matters is that he scares the hell out of a lot of very important people in Washington who can't speak out, in the military, in the intelligence community.": "Seymour",
  "I'm more frightened than interested by artificial intelligence - in fact, perhaps fright and interest are not far away from one another. Things can become real in your mind, you can be tricked, and you believe things you wouldn't ordinarily. A world run by automatons doesn't seem completely unrealistic any more. It's a bit chilling.": "Gemma",
  "Every major player is working on this technology of artificial intelligence. As of now, it's benign... but I would say that the day is not far off when artificial intelligence as applied to cyber warfare becomes a threat to everybody.": "Ted",

  "The higher the voice the smaller the intellect.": "Ernest",
  "What suprised me most about the real Gordon Selfridge was actually about his sons, Ralph and Oliver. They were both highly respected in their fields, influencing Information Technology and Robotics deeply.

  "Children are the keys of paradise.": "Eric",

  "When you get together in a group, it becomes like a family, with the different personalities and the politics that comes with being in a band. It's different than bringing something in by yourself.": "Albert",
  "Family always gonna be there. The material things, they come and go.": "Romeo",

  "I'm surrounded by great friends and family. I don't know what I would do without them.": "Emma",
  "When we understand the connection between how we live and how long we live, it's easier to make different choices.

  "I do believe that God blessed me in life with a wonderful family, a successful career, and a loving marriage, and remain thankful for that blessing.": "Bonnie",
  "Think about what people are doing on Facebook today. They're keeping up with their friends and family, but they're also building an image and identity for themselves, which in a sense is their brand.

  "I have a family, loving aunts, and a good home. No, on the surface I seem to have everything except my one true friend. All I think about when I'm with friends is having a good time. I can't bring myself to talk about anything but ordinary everyday things. We don't seem to be able to get any closer, and that's the problem.": "Anne",
  "I had a really wonderful upbringing. We were a tight family. It was wonderful to grow up with so many siblings. We were all just a year or two apart, and we were always so supportive of each other. I learned everything from my older brother and sister and taught it to my younger sisters.": "Joaquin",

  "The kitchen is the heart of every home, for the most part. It evokes memories of your family history.": "Debi",
  "Anyone with a heart, with a family, has experienced loss. No one escapes unscathed.

  "You are the bows from which your children as living arrows are sent forth.": "Khalil",
  "I would like to be remembered as a man who had a wonderful time living life, a man who had good friends, fine family - and I don't think I could ask for anything more than that, actually.": "Frank",
  "Some of the most important conversations I've ever had occurred at my family's dinner table.": "Bob",

  "Life is not a matter of place, things or comfort; rather, it concerns the basic human rights of family, country, justice and human dignity.": "Imelda",
  "Me and my family are straight. I am blessed. I am alive, man, and I am healthy, and that is the only thing that matters. Me and my family, everybody else, it really doesn't matter because why do you care about somebody talking negative about you if they don't know you?": "Allen",
  "I don't feel much pressure to fit in. I never have. I've always just wanted to do my thing. I have really good friends and good family, and if I don't fit in somewhere else, I fit in at home.": "Ariana",
  "We were a family that made our Halloween costumes. Or, more accurately, my mother made them. She took no suggestions or advice. Halloween costumes were her territory. She was the brain behind my brother's winning girl costume, stuffing her own bra with newspapers for him to wear under a cashmere sweater and smearing red lipstick on his lips.": "Ann",
  "I grew up in a family with two very strong women, my mother and my older sister, and they were big influences on my life.": "Darren",
  "Since I'm always working, my best holiday memories are definitely when I can just go home and spend time with my family.": "Chris",
  "I do have a close circle of friends and I am very fortunate to have them as friends. I feel very close to them I think friends are everything in life after your family. You come across lots of people all the time but you only make very few friends and you have to be true to them otherwise what's the point in life?": "Shah",
  "Win or lose, I always like to get back to my friends and family. They keep me grounded. When I'm home with my friends, I'm always the same Gabriel. I'm no better or worse in their eyes because of my results. It's good to be with your true friends. It always reminds me of where I'm from and who I am.": "Gabriel",
  "I believe in the value of life. I believe we must prepare our children for tomorrow with the family values of my grandparents.": "Ryan",
  "I'm already popular in my city. I was just trying to get rich. Man, I'm not gonna lie to you; I didn't really want to go back to school. I mean, my family was mad about that. Because, you know, you tell your family you want to rap, and they look at you like you're crazy.": "Lil",
  "Every family should have the right to spend their money, after tax, as they wish, and not as the government dictates. Let us extend choice, extend the will to choose and the chance to choose.": "Margaret",
  "Women are, in my view, natural peacemakers. As givers and nurturers of life, through their focus on human relationships and their engagement with the demanding work of raising children and protecting family life, they develop a deep sense of empathy that cuts through to underlying human realities.": "Daisaku",
  "I'll tell you what I'm grateful for, and that's the clarity of understanding that the most important things in life are health, family and friends, and the time to spend on them.": "Kenneth",
  "I love pizza. I want to marry it, but it would just be to eat her family at the wedding.": "Mike",
  "I am confident that nobody... will accuse me of selfishness if I ask to spend time, while I am still in good health, with my family, my friends and also with myself.": "Nelson",
  "I enjoy going out by myself... always have, always will. I don't have security guards, and, for the most part, I enjoy meeting new people. I see myself as a regular guy who likes playing video games with his nieces and nephews and poker with his family. I don't have an art collection or take exotic vacations. I enjoy being at home.": "Vince",
  "No one really wants to admit they are lonely, and it is never really addressed very much between friends and family. But I have felt lonely many times in my life.": "Bill",
  "Kids can learn a lot about necessities and wants by recognizing what people live without. A common routine, but one that should not be overlooked, is having a family donation to a charity for those less fortunate. Ask your kids to search for items, toys, or clothes that they no longer use and contribute those items a collection box.": "Alexa",
  "I like to spend as much time with my friends and family as possible.": "Zara",
  "Estate planning is an important and everlasting gift you can give your family. And setting up a smooth inheritance isn't as hard as you might think.": "Suze",
  "There's a bond among a kitchen staff, I think. You spend more time with your chef in the kitchen than you do with your own family.": "Gordon",
  "Everyone feels like family and I am back in the city that I love.": "Chris",
  "Friendship is held to be the severest test of character. It is easy, we think, to be loyal to a family and clan, whose blood is in your own veins.": "Charles",
  "I have a dream of re-creating the fantastic family I grew up in with my brother and my parents. I am lucky that I have such a good image of family life - my father and mother are still in love, still happy.": "Caterina",
  "I always thought I wanted to play professionally, and I always knew that to do that I'd have to make a lot of sacrifices. I made sacrifices by leaving Argentina, leaving my family to start a new life. I changed my friends, my people. Everything. But everything I did, I did for football, to achieve my dream.": "Lionel",
  "I have a very, very good life. I'm grateful for all of my friends, my family and the life that I have, and the possibilities in my future.": "Raquel",
  "If it looks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, we have at least to consider the possibility that we have a small aquatic bird of the family anatidae on our hands.": "Douglas",
  "Everyone should have cancer one time - then you'd know that other things aren't important. The guy that gives you the finger at the stoplight don't mean nothing anymore. You come home and something's cold, or you didn't get something in the mail. Big deal. You want to get up every day and see your family and your friends.": "Bobby",

  "I like that there's no love as fierce as the love you feel for your family that there's no one you feel more protective of than the very same people who can drive you crazy. ": "Kate",
  "I was in Yorkshire. We were a family of five and I used to be sent sometimes to get the rations for the week and I was easily able to carry them back. It was like one egg and a tiny bit of tea.": "Judi",
  "I come from a blue collar family, but my personal life isn't. I didn't get the gene that my grandfather had in spades. He was a local hero. Built the church that I went to. Built the house I grew up in. Steamfitter, pipefitter, electrician, mechanic and plumber. I wanted to do those things. But it just didn't come easy.": "Mike",
  "He who is overly attached to his family members experiences fear and sorrow, for the root of all grief is attachment. Thus one should discard attachment to be happy.": "Chanakya",

  "For me, it's about the way I carry myself and the way I treat other people. My relationship and how I feel about God and what He does for me, is something deeply personal. It's where I came from, my family, I was brought up in a religious household and that's very important to me.": "Beyonce",
  "Weekends are sacred for me. They're the perfect time to relax and spend time with family and friends.": "Marcus",
  "At this level, the individual perceives the maintenance of the expectations of his family, group, or nation as valuable in its own right, regardless of immediate and obvious consequences.": "Lawrence",
  "Marriage is an act of will that signifies and involves a mutual gift, which unites the spouses and binds them to their eventual souls, with whom they make up a sole family - a domestic church.": "Pope",
  "I'm a pretty uncomplicated person. I live a very simple life with my family and I enjoy very ordinary things.": "Khaled",
  "I just want to be successful. I'm not going to sit here and be like, 'I want to win a Grammy' or whatever; if that comes, that's awesome. But I just want to be successful and provide for my whole family and get my family out the hood.": "Lil",
  "Tennis is all about mental toughness, and you have to keep your head in the game. I make time to relax away from competition pressures, travel and intense training schedules to make sure I'm looking after myself. Taking time out with family and friends helps to maintain the work-life balance everyone needs.": "Samantha",
  "Our trust in the future has lost its innocence. We know now that anything can happen from one minute to the next. Politics, religion, economics, and the institutions of family and community all have become abruptly unsure.": "John",
  "What I miss the most is chatting with my friends and family and having a good laugh over a simple meal.": "Kim",
  "If you ever start feeling like you have the goofiest, craziest, most dysfunctional family in the world, all you have to do is go to a state fair. Because five minutes at the fair, you'll be going, 'you know, we're alright. We are dang near royalty.'": "Jeff",
  "Digital intimacy ruins the appetite for the real thing. So, when kids are gaming or even when spouses are gaming, they lose their appetite for genuine intimacy. Kids lose their appetite for getting their intimacy needs, their hunger for significance and attachment, with the family, and it erodes the relationship between them and their parents.": "Gordon",
  "There is a core value I wanted to illuminate: No matter what kind of family you have - straight, gay, married, single parent, separated, no kids, two kids, 20 kids, whatever - we all go through the human comedy. But if the bonds are strong enough, and the desire is there, you can get to the other side, still together and still a family.": "Lisa",
  "I am proud to have been born in Iowa. Through the eyes of a ten-year-old boy, it was a place of adventure and daily discoveries - the wonder of the growing crops, the excitements of the harvest, the journeys to the woods for nuts and hunting, the joys of snowy winters, the comfort of the family fireside, of good food and tender care.": "Herbert",
  "Actors are one family over the entire world.": "Eleanor",
  "Like religion, politics, and family planning, cereal is not a topic to be brought up in public. It's too controversial.": "Erma",
  "Family life is too intimate to be preserved by the spirit of justice. It can be sustained by a spirit of love which goes beyond justice.": "Reinhold",
  "I can have everything I love at the same time. I can have my family, I can have my friends, and I can have my quiet life, which I also like. I can have my football, and I can have everything together, and I don't need to give up one to be better than what I am.": "Jose",
  "Leave the matter of religion to the family altar, the church, and the private school, supported entirely by private contributions. Keep the church and state forever separate.": "Ulysses",
  "I think that in a year I may retire. I cannot take my money with me when I die and I wish to enjoy it, with my family, while I live. I should prefer living in Germany to any other country, though I am an American, and am loyal to my country.": "Harry",
  "Being born into the Royal Family is like being born into a mental asylum. Marrying into it is not something to be taken lightly.": "John",
  "I grew up hunting and fishing. I've always been into archery. I've always been into cars... In my family, that was just stuff we did. That's just the way it was.": "Paul",

  "In the past 40 years, the United States lost more than a million farmers and ranchers. Many of our farmers are aging. Today, only nine percent of family farm income comes from farming, and more and more of our farmers are looking elsewhere for their primary source of income.": "Tom",
  "Opponents of capital punishment argue that the state has no right to take a murderer's life. Apparently, one fact that abolitionists forget or overlook is that the state is acting not only on behalf of society, but also on behalf of the murdered person and the murdered person's family.": "Dennis",
  "The only siblings I have are half-siblings. My nuclear family would have been an extra-suffocating threesome. Instead, I have an interesting brother and sister, in-laws, and darling nephews.": "Jane",

  "My priority is to hang out with the ones I love - my family, my loved ones.": "Cote",
  "My family is no different from yours. We may be different from the geography that we come from. Some of you all may pray differently than I do, some of you all may be from a different ethnicity, but we all have the same story.": "Cory",
  "The clan is nothing more than a larger family, with its patriarchal chief as the natural head, and the union of several clans by intermarriage and voluntary connection constitutes the tribe.": "Charles",
  "To be successful in coaching you have to treat your team like a family. The leader needs backing from everyone.": "Morgan",
  "When I'm, like, 30, I want to go off the map, have a family and live in Malibu with a farm, and just raise my own chickens.": "Kylie",
  "I was born in a very poor family. I used to sell tea in a railway coach as a child. My mother used to wash utensils and do lowly household work in the houses of others to earn a livelihood. I have seen poverty very closely. I have lived in poverty. As a child, my entire childhood was steeped in poverty.": "Narendra",
  "I'm a lucky person because I've been loved a lot. I have a great family.": "Monica",
  "Right now I just want to chill for a while. Take a hiatus from all the craziness. To clean my house, see my family. Just see some movies and pick some strawberries.": "Lauren",
  "I come from a family of very devout, praying people. That idea of peace and love toward humanity shouldn't be nationalistic or denominational. It should be a chief concern for all mankind.": "Mos",
  "God has already done everything He's going to do. The ball is now in your court. If you want success, if you want wisdom, if you want to be prosperous and healthy, you're going to have to do more than meditate and believe; you must boldly declare words of faith and victory over yourself and your family.": "Joel",
  "The breakdown of the black community, in order to maintain slavery, began with the breakdown of the black family. Men and women were not legally allowed to get married because you couldn't have that kind of love. It might get in the way of the economics of slavery. Your children could be taken from you and literally sold down the river.": "Kerry",
  "I'll never stop dreaming that one day we can be a real family, together, all of us laughing and talking, loving and understanding, not looking at the past but only to the future.": "LaToya",
  "It's very strange that most people don't care if their knowledge of their family history only goes back three generations.": "Douglas",
  "I think every chef, not just in America, but across the world, has a double-edged sword - two jackets, one that's driven, a self-confessed perfectionist, thoroughbred, hate incompetence and switch off the stove, take off the jacket and become a family man.": "Gordon",
  "The root of the kingdom is in the state. The root of the state is in the family. The root of the family is in the person of its head.": "Mencius",
  "We will see a breakdown of the family and family values if we decide to approve same-sex marriage, and if we decide to establish homosexuality as an acceptable alternative lifestyle with all the benefits that go with equating it with the heterosexual lifestyle.": "Jerry",
  "My mother, whom I love dearly, has continually revised my life story within the context of a complicated family history that includes more than the usual share of divorce, step-children, dysfunction, and obfuscation. I've spent most of my adult life attempting to deconstruct that history and separate fact from fiction.": "Melissa",
  "What is important is family, friends, giving back to your community and finding meaning in life.": "Adrian",
  "I'm from a nice, suburban, middle-class family, but my tattoos remind me where I've been.": "Tom",
  "I come from a very working-class background, so my family would have been downstairs in the past, as opposed to upstairs. People are often quite surprised to hear that, that I'm not actually posh.": "Michelle",
  "What do most people say on their deathbed? They don't say, 'I wish I'd made more money.' What they say is, 'I wish I'd spent more time with my family and done more for society or my community.'": "David",
  "The things that make me happiest in the whole world are going on the occasional picnic, either with my children or with my partner; big family gatherings; and being able to go to the grocery store - if I can get those things in, I'm doing good.": "Kate",
  "I love to cook, and I love to have all my family around the dinner table.": "Julia",
  "I saw my first two Broadway shows when I was 4 years old, 'The Lion King' and 'Beauty and the Beast,' and after both of them I came home and reenacted the entirety of the shows on my living room table for my family and friends. I started doing that after every show I saw until I actually did my first youth production when I was 5.": "Max",
  "The one thing I've always said: Let your family and close friends be the judge of who you are as a person. Don't worry about being judged by others who don't know you, because your family and close friends know what you're all about, good and bad.": "Rick",
  "I have a lot of nieces and nephews. I was always around kids. I was like the family babysitter because I was the only one that wasn't married.": "Doreen",
  "I was the youngest child and the only son. I was expected to shine in academics. It seemed like too big a risk to take up cricket as a career. I thought I had to live up to my family's expectations. So I chose to be an engineer.": "Sushant",
  "Since I was a boy - born into a farming family in Bonaire, GA - I've had agriculture running through my veins.": "Sonny",
  "He that raises a large family does, indeed, while he lives to observe them, stand a broader mark for sorrow; but then he stands a broader mark for pleasure too.": "Benjamin",

  "The functions of the family in a highly differentiated society are not to be interpreted as functions directly on behalf of the society, but on behalf of personality.": "Talcott",
  "I don't think a female running a house is a problem, a broken family. It's perceived as one because of the notion that a head is a man.": "Toni",
  "Abortion is an attack on the family and the humanity that unites us all.": "Alveda",

  "Growing up in the days when you still had to punch buttons to make a telephone call, I could recall the numbers of all my close friends and family. Today, I'm not sure if I know more than four phone numbers by heart. And that's probably more than most.": "Joshua",
  "Life hands us a lot of hard choices, and other people can help us more than we might realize. We often think we should make important decisions using just our own internal resources. What are the pros and cons? What does my gut tell me? But often we have friends and family who know us in ways we don't know ourselves.": "Sheena",
  "Once you agree upon the price you and your family must pay for success, it enables you to ignore the minor hurts, the opponent's pressure, and the temporary failures.": "Vince",
  "There are times when I'm super-overwhelmed, and everything feels like it's hitting me in the face at once, but I think what's keeping me calm, and who I am by staying true to myself, is my whole family being so supportive and keeping me grounded. They treat me the exact same way they treated me years and years ago.": "Shawn",
  "We must search out totally new ways to anchor ourselves, for all the old roots religion, nation, community, family, or profession are now shaking under the hurricane impact of the accelerative thrust.": "Alvin",

  "In the family, in interpersonal relationships, even in friendship, faith is tremendously important.

And you have to support and believe in your children.": "Greg",
  "One of the greatest things drama can do, at it's best, is to redefine the words we use every day such as love, home, family, loyalty and envy. Tragedy need not be a downer.": "Ben",
  "I'm lucky in that I have close friends and family and my agent to advise me.": "Imogen",
  "Dictators, unlike Democrats, depend on a small coterie to sustain their power. These backers, generally drawn from the military, the senior civil service, and family or clan members, have a synergistic relationship with their dictator. The dictator delivers opportunities for them to become rich, and they protect him from being overthrown.": "Bruce",
  "I am a racer. I'm not a race car driver. I am a racer. I race. That's what I do. I don't go on vacations. I don't take my family on vacations because I don't have a family. My family is the racing family.": "Tony",

  "I kind of love coming home and being with family and feeling comfortable and knowing where I come from I kind of like it. ": "Michael",

  "Blood relatives often have nothing to do with family, and similarly, family is about who you choose to make your life with.": "Oliver",
  "Apparently, one in five people in the world are Chinese. And there are five people in my family, so it must be one of them. It's either my mum or my dad. Or my older brother, Colin. Or my younger brother, Ho-Chan-Chu. But I think it's Colin.": "Tim",
  "I hate the way they portray us in the media. If you see a black family it says they're looting, if you see a white family it says they're looking for food.": "Kanye",
  "My family has very strong women. My mother never laughed at my dream of Africa, even though everyone else did because we didn't have any money, because Africa was the 'dark continent', and because I was a girl.": "Jane",
  "Music was your real passion, this thing you held dear even above family. It was this relationship that never betrayed you.

  "When you grow up in an extended family, or in a stable neighborhood with two or three generations of families who live there, you feel seen.

  "I was born in South Africa during apartheid, a system of laws that made it illegal for people to mix in South Africa. And this was obviously awkward because I grew up in a mixed family. My mother's a black woman, South African Xhosa woman... and my father's Swiss, from Switzerland.": "Trevor",

In order to fight against our tribe's termination, he went to newspapers and politicians and urged them to advocate for our tribe in Washington. He also supported his family through the Depression as a truck farmer.": "Louise",
  "I was raised by a single mother who made a way for me. She used to scrub floors as a domestic worker, put a cleaning rag in her pocketbook and ride the subways in Brooklyn so I would have food on the table.

  "I admire people's marriages, and I think it's a wonderful thing to have, but I don't think it's the only way to live. I think there are many ways to live and many ways to establish intimate support in your life that can be from family or friends or great roommates that you like.": "Linda",

  "You think about child abuse and you think of a father viciously attacking a daughter or a son, but in my family it was my mother. My mother, I would say, was a... very brutal disciplinarian.": "Lynn",
  "Do it no matter what. If you believe in it, it is something very honorable. If somebody around you or your family does not understand it, then that's their problem. But if you do have a passion, an honest passion, just do it.": "Mario",
  "The blues was like that problem child that you may have had in the family. You was a little bit ashamed to let anybody see him, but you loved him. You just didn't know how other people would take it.": "B.",
  "Holidays are the best. I couldn't imagine being from a small family.": "Kim",
  "Seeing the family is a very important part of my weekend.": "Susannah",

  "The God who existed before any religion counts on you to make the oneness of the human family known and celebrated.": "Desmond",
  "I'm just trying to be the me that I am and not all of this other crap. I just want to be the family man, and if somehow I can make the money to get my ranch and get the hell away from everybody else, that would be awesome.": "Chris",
  "There are so many different elements to surfing. Small waves, big waves, long boards, short boards. This makes it a sport you can share with people. It's not just a solitary thing - it's become a family thing, too. It's about exercising and passing something on from father to son, and from mother to daughter.": "Kelly",
  "It's hard to give up the self-esteem connected to being codependent and appearing 'right,' which is probably a survival behavior learned from growing up in a crazy family. It feels like you will actually disappear.": "Melody",
  "To some extent, people who are insane are nonconformists, and society and their family wish they would live what appear to be useful lives.": "John",
  "There's a lot of conflict and darkness inside everybody's family. We all pretend to outsiders that it's not so, but behind locked doors, there are usually high emotions running.": "Salman",
  "My best career decision was probably not giving up when I wanted to. God as well as my family and friends were there for me during my toughest times.": "Jeremy",
  "My mom keeps me going, man. She deserves such a good life. I just wanna give it to her. My dad, too. My family, my friends, they keep me motivated. Just knowing my personal legend, just knowing what I'm supposed to do, that keeps me going.": "Big",
  "I came from a traditional family, and it was an exciting but challenging transition to move to America and live on my own. The world around me was suddenly so different.": "Chitra",
  "Regarding marriage, it - somehow, it didn't happen. One fellow in such a big family not getting married is not an issue.": "A.",
  "November 11, 1802, I arrived at Judge Patterson's at Lisle. This respectable family treated me with every mark of distinction and friendship, and likewise all the people did the same. I really want for words to express my gratitude.": "Deborah",
  "In family relationships, 'love' is really spelled 't-i-m-e,' time. Taking time for each other is the key for harmony at home.": "Dieter",
  "My family is everything. They love me unconditionally.": "Sofia",
  "My greatest success story has been my family.": "Alex",
  "My family made it through Hurricane Sandy. We have water, power, and a roof, but the survivor's guilt makes me want to hide. Sneak away from the brilliance of life. It shouts at me: 'Don't enjoy anything too much; people are suffering.' I feel childlike somehow.": "Alysia",
  "You may not know your complete family history, but the reality is everyone has something, and as you get older, you start to worry about these things more. Health is not sort of like a 6-month project. Health is a lifetime accumulation of behaviors.": "Anne",
  "You can always tell a person's real character and personhood by those who closely surround him, especially if they're family.": "Chuck",
  "In modern life, we tend to forget family values because of the hectic schedule.": "Mahesh",
  "Founding a company is a sheer act of will and tenacity in the face of immense skepticism from everyone - investors, customers, friends, family, and employees, to name a few.": "Steve",
  "Ritesh Deshmukh is rock star. He has a lovely family. He works so hard, and he's a great actor. He's funny, friendly, doesn't have an ego, and is so nice to everyone. He's a fine professional, a good husband, and a good father. That's a rock star for me.": "Nargis",
  "I think when things get hard with your family, it's really easy to want to isolate yourself. The world is so harsh, so when stuff happens outside, you want to go to your family, but when stuff happens inside your family, you sort of start to feel like, 'I'm alone. There is no place I can go to where just nothing will happen to me.'": "Dove",
  "When fear rushed in, I learned how to hear my heart racing but refused to allow my feelings to sway me. That resilience came from my family. It flowed through our bloodline.": "Coretta",
  "I have no ambitions at all! I have none... seriously. I want to be a good father. I want to be a good husband. I want to be a good son, a good brother, a good family member. I don't have any ambition to direct a film or write a play. I like acting.": "Pilou",
  "We all act differently in certain places. We don't want to admit it, but we're different where we grew up than we are with our family and than we are with the guys that we went to college with or our fraternity brothers. People just exist differently. It's small, subtle things, but different colors come out. That's all there is to it.": "Mike",
  "I have a very good family. I'm very fortunate to have a very good family. I believe very strongly in the family. It's one of the things we have in our platform, is to talk about it.": "Dan",

  "I looked up my family tree and found three dogs using it.": "Rodney",
  "You know, true love really matters, friends really matter, family really matters. Being responsible and disciplined and healthy really matters.": "Courtney",
  "The family only represents one aspect, however important an aspect, of a human being's functions and activities. A life is beautiful and ideal or the reverse, only when we have taken into our consideration the social as well as the family relationship.": "Havelock",
  "The secret is to make sure your family comes before anything else, because no matter what you do you've got to come home.": "Barry",
  "I guess my religious faith sustained me more than anything else. Family is also very important. If I didn't have children, it would have been too difficult. Even if you are strong, you still need people who would support you all the way.": "Corazon",
  "While we may be of different faiths, we have a strong sense of faith, family, community. We hold the values of freedom and human rights very high and I think that those are all a part of a very strong quilt that binds us together.": "Bob",
  "My own mother always taught me that fairness was a family value - I think equal pay is about fairness for everyone.": "Mike",
  "Soon after, I returned home to my family, with a determination to bring them as soon as possible to live in Kentucky, which I esteemed a second paradise, at the risk of my life and fortune.": "Daniel",
  "The other thing is quality of life; if you have a place where you can go and have a picnic with your family, it doesn't matter if it's a recession or not, you can include that in your quality of life.": "Jim",
  "My family and I held no hatred for those people because we realized they were victims of their own ignorance.": "Ryan",
  "I see my friends, my family, my cousins work all day long for very little money, and if I have this problem of not being able to wall on the streets, it's not a big deal.": "Olivier",
  "Like family, we are tied to each other. This is what all good musicians understand.": "Billy",

  "In the investigation of a neurotic style of life, we must always suspect an opponent, and note who suffers most because of the patient's condition. Usually this is a member of the family.": "Alfred",
  "Babies control and bring up their families as much as they are controlled by them in fact the family brings up baby by being brought up by him.": "Erik",
  "I don't like staying in hotels. I like to be in my own bed. San Diego as a city is really awesome. The only hard part of it for me is that I'm away from my family and my house. But as far as shooting down there, we get amazing locations, and the crew is really, really stellar down there. They are really fun.": "Kristen",
  "The dream was not to put one black family in the White House, the dream was to make everything equal in everybody's house.": "Al",
  "When I was a kid, the only way I saw movies was from the back seat of my family's car at the drive-in.": "Forest",
  "Being rich is a good thing. Not just in the obvious sense of benefitting you and your family, but in the broader sense. Profits are not a zero sum game. The more you make, the more of a financial impact you can have.": "Mark",
  "And when I was young, my family was perfectly nice. I write a lot about it, as you noticed. But it was rather limited. I think, I don't think anyone in my family would really feel I'd done them an injustice by saying that. We didn't see many people. There were many books. It was as if I wanted to get away from home.": "Christopher",
  "A man filled with the love of God is not content with blessing his family alone, but ranges through the whole world, anxious to bless the whole human race.": "Joseph",
  "In all seriousness, it really should be difficult for me to be too strange. After all, a great family raised me.": "Tim",
  "When I first met Big, we were both at a 'Bad Boy' family photo shoot. I was kind of familiar with the name Biggie Smalls, but I really wasn't that much into hip-hop at the time, so I really didn't know that was him. He said he didn't even know I was an artist on 'Bad Boy.'": "Faith",
  "I just feel like it gets harder and harder every year with Ace getting older and time away from my husband and even family events such as birthdays and friends' weddings and things that I've always just missed out on because of softball.": "Jennie",
  "When I do get the chance I just love to hang around at home with friends and family.": "Delta",
  "I feel I'm able to get rid of any demons lurking in my psyche through my writing, which leaves me free to create all of this and to enjoy our family life, stepping away from all the fictional traumas and the dramas. If I write about family in crisis, then I won't have to live through it, I guess.": "Jodi",
  "I was angry and frustrated until I started my own family and my first child was born. Until then I didn't really appreciate life the way I should have, but fortunately I woke up.": "Johnny",
  "I love being at home, being with friends and family. I'm of European stock, brought up in Australia. I'm a passionate guy. I just love life.": "Eric",
  "A lot of parents never speak to their transgender kids again that's not the case in my family.": "Chaz",
  "It's a tremendous responsibility to be direct descendants of the prophet Muhammad. This family has had the burden of leadership on its shoulders for 1,400 years. I'm not going to drop the ball on my shift.": "Abdullah",
  "The details surrounding both my marriage and subsequent filing for divorce are private, and I had hoped to keep them that way for the sake of my family.": "Eminem",
  "The baby boomers are getting older, and will stay older for longer. And they will run right into the dementia firing range. How will a society cope? Especially a society that can't so readily rely on those stable family relationships that traditionally provided the backbone of care?": "Terry",
  "America's a family. We all yell at each other. It all works out.": "Louis",
  "I just want to be healthy and stay alive and keep my family going and everything and keep my friends going and try to do something so that this world will be peaceful. That is the most ambitious and the most difficult thing, but I'm there trying to do it.": "Yoko",
  "In the States, you can buy Chinese food. In Beijing you can buy hamburger. It's very close. Now I feel the world become a big family, like a really big family. You have many neighbors. Not like before, two countries are far away.": "Jet",

  "When you live on the road, going home is a place to escape and just be with your family to unwind.": "Jonathan",
  "If you come from a solid family structure, it doesn't matter what you go through in your life. You're going to be okay.": "Alyssa",
  "Accidents happen, whether they're car accidents, friendly fire, drug overdoses. Accidents happen, and they're tragic. It's like a bomb that goes off and pieces of shrapnel rip into the flesh of the family. It's the families that need the compassion, because everywhere they walk, every day, someone reminds them of their loss.": "James",
  "I know it's a cliche, but the whole family is just whacked. I mean, we're all out of our minds. They're the funniest, most eccentric bizarre people I've ever met, my siblings.": "Dana",

  "The life of a model isn't easy. But I try to keep a good head on my shoulders by staying close to my family and old friends. They're my support system.": "Constance",
  "Your crew becomes your family and you trust the director and the other actors on the set, and it's a very safe place.": "Aleksa",
  "Antique things have an appreciation and worth. Something can be old, but it can be timeless; therefore, it becomes an antique. If this antique is preserved and deemed precious, it could be passed down as a family heirloom.": "CeeLo",
  "Families can be the most detrimental things to have in your life. They are sometimes the most poisonous relationships that people have. Sometimes family is the thing that keeps you from ever achieving what you want to achieve, and yet people hold it and hold it and grab it and try to fix it and twist it and turn it.": "Amy",
  "Language leads a double life - and so does the novelist. You chat with family and friends, you attend to your correspondence, you consult menus and shopping lists, you observe road signs, and so on. Then you enter your study, where language exists in quite another form - as the stuff of patterned artifice.": "Martin",
  "One person may need (or want) more leisure, another more work; one more adventure, another more security, and so on. It is this diversity that makes a country, indeed a state, a city, a church, or a family, healthy. 'One-size-fits-all,' and that size determined by the State has a name, and that name is 'slavery.'": "David",
  "That's the beauty of education, kids taking lessons out of the classroom and back into their own world where they can positively affect their family, their friends, and their greater community.": "Erin",
  "I have learned so many things from my mother about the right upbringing, the right values, value for money, value for elders, for family members. I think these things only a parent can teach you.": "Karisma",
  "I wanted to deliver babies and become a midwife. I think childbirth is one of the most amazing things you could ever experience, and I loved working with people and seeing the joys in family when they welcome a new member to it. It really brought me joy to be around that.": "Natalie",
  "We have a president who stole the presidency through family ties, arrogance and intimidation, employing Republican operatives to exercise the tactics of voter fraud by disenfranchising thousands of blacks, elderly Jews and other minorities.": "Barbra",
  "Like all best families, we have our share of eccentricities, of impetuous and wayward youngsters and of family disagreements.": "Queen",
  "A family is a risky venture, because the greater the love, the greater the loss... That's the trade-off. But I'll take it all.": "Brad",
  "The police cannot protect the citizen at this stage of our development, and they cannot even protect themselves in many cases. It is up to the private citizen to protect himself and his family, and this is not only acceptable, but mandatory.": "Jeff",
  "No family should have to depend on the labor of its children to put food on the table and no person should be forced to work in captivity.": "Hilda",
  "I'm not asking that people accept homosexuality. I'm not asking that they believe like I do that it's inborn. I'm not asking that. All I'm saying is don't let these children suffer without a family because of your bias.": "Rosie",
  "No amount of law enforcement can solve a problem that goes back to the family.": "J.",
  "The Sabbath is a weekly cathedral raised up in my dining room, in my family, in my heart.": "Anita",
  "On Thanksgiving I will stop to give thanks that my family is safe and healthy, especially because I realize that, following the tragedies of this year, it is all too real a possibility that they might not have been.": "Bobby",
  "I can't stress to you enough how much I can relate to teens being cyberbullied. Something that helps me is looking at old videos of me and my friends from middle school, or videos of my family. I love watching funny videos of my favorite people - it really cheers me up.": "Ariana",
  "We all have a personal pool of quicksand inside us where we begin to sink and need friends and family to find us and remind us of all the good that has been and will be.": "Regina",
  "America is the student who defies the odds to become the first in a family to go to college - the citizen who defies the cynics and goes out there and votes - the young person who comes out of the shadows to demand the right to dream. That's what America is about.": "Barack",
  "If you don't have your friends and your family, what do you really have? You can have all the money in the world, but with no friends and no family, it's no good.": "Meek",
  "I am thankful for all the blessings and talents I have been given, but most of all I am thankful for my loving and supportive family.": "Olivia",
  "Life goes by really fast, and it seems that there are times when you're burying a lot of friends and family. And then there are times that feel really precious and everybody is doing okay. This is one of those times.": "Amy",
  "Next to hurting my family, cheating on me is the worst thing someone could do.": "Robert",
  "Boys used to call me Soda in school days. Soda means 'serving officers daughters association.' I miss those days when I had a very protected life: one could get close and bond with other army people that they gradually would become your extended family.": "Anushka",
  "Over the years I've learnt to live with two persons in my heart. One is Edson, who has fun with his friends and family; the other is the football player Pele. I didn't want the name. 'Pele' sounds like baby-talk in Portuguese.": "Pele",
  "I've discovered that Motown and Broadway have a lot in common - a family of wonderfully talented, passionate, hardworking young people, fiercely competitive but also full of love and appreciation for the work, for each other and for the people in the audience.": "Berry",
  "My father used to play with my brother and me in the yard. Mother would come out and say, 'You're tearing up the grass'; 'We're not raising grass,' Dad would reply. 'We're raising boys.'": "Harmon",
  "The building of friendship, family, community and love is complicated. We are so isolated in this country, no longer supported by tribes and villages.": "Jasmine",
  "I come from a family where soccer has always been very present. My uncles, my father and my brother were all players.": "Ronaldinho",
  "I come from a family where gravy is considered a beverage.": "Erma",
  "I spend most of my time at the ranch with my family, and enjoy life - watch the sun come up, watch it go down, thank God for another day, and just be happy.": "Marcus",
  "We can't just rail against crime. We must speak of the root problems - devastating family breakup, an insidious culture of violence that cheapens human life, skyrocketing prisoner recidivism rates that rob our communities of husbands and fathers - and recognize that there is a societal role in rehabilitation and restoration.": "Frank",
  "When my mom, Mercedes, and her younger sister, Juanita, first came from Puerto Rico, they were the youngest in the family. They had to jump into a new community and really learn English, assimilate, and adapt - and I saw that. I grew up in that community.": "Kimberly",
  "Michelle and I don't want anyone telling us who our family's doctor should be - and no one should decide that for you either. Under our proposals, if you like your doctor, you keep your doctor. If you like your current insurance, you keep that insurance. Period, end of story.": "Barack",
  "My wife once said that one of her great ambitions was to walk down the streets of Hong Kong with her children. So we all went to Asia on one occasion. Then she said she'd like to walk down the streets of Jerusalem with her children. So we arranged our family finances and all went to Jerusalem.": "Gordon",
  "Happy or unhappy, families are all mysterious. We have only to imagine how differently we would be described - and will be, after our deaths - by each of the family members who believe they know us.": "Gloria",
  "What is it to enjoy life? Sit at the beach? No. What it is is that you have to do something, you have be productive, make a contribution to the society, to the family, to yourself.": "Frank",
  "I savour the adulation and love I have been getting from my fans and the blessings of elders in my family. Fourteen years have given me a lot and I can't thank God and the industry enough.": "Akshay",
  "Even someone as photographed and aware of the camera as members of the royal family needs to feel completely comfortable if they are to look their best.": "Mario",
  "If you dream of something worth doing and then simply go to work on it and don't think anything of personalities, or emotional conflicts, or of money, or of family distractions; it is amazing how quickly you get through those 5,000 steps.": "Edwin",
  "Some twins feel like they need to compare themselves to each other, but we're not that way. That's because of my parents, though, and having six kids in the family.": "Ashley",
  "We have overcome economic devastation, defeated mighty oppressors, and lifted up generation after generation of Americans. We can - and we will - do it again. For that is our birthright as members of the American family - white, black, Hispanic, Asian, immigrant, or descendant of the Founding Fathers themselves.": "Brian",
  "It's one of the worst-kept secrets of family life that all parents have a preferred son or daughter, and the rules for acknowledging it are the same everywhere: The favored kids recognize their status and keep quiet about it - the better to preserve the good thing they've got going and to keep their siblings off their back.": "Jeffrey",
  "If you feel rooted in your home and family, if you're active in your community, there's nothing more empowering. The best way to make a difference in the world is to start by making a difference in your own life.": "Julia",
  "I lead a simple life. I get residuals. I have a family we're doing alright.": "Robert",
  "Most women are not programmed to prefer a great career to a great man and a family. They feel they were sold a bill of goods at college and by the media.": "Dennis",
  "One of the things that's important about family is the narrative history they create for themselves.": "Gabe",
  "I've gotten to learn what's important in life and what's not important, and what to spend energy on and what not to. I don't have a family like some of my teammates, but I have a lot of things pulling at me that I have to put my energy into.": "Aaron",
  "All I care is that my family, and my loved ones, understand me. Or that they understand me to a degree - I don't understand me very much. And I don't need the world to understand me. That is the most egocentric thing.": "Andrea",
  "You've got a movie where the pro-choice family gives their daughter no choice. The pro-life family murders. What seems to be the good mother, the kind of hippie painter, sweet and cute mother has no love for her daughter really.": "Ellen",
  "I'm happiest with my family around me.": "Amy",
  "I thank God, Jesus, and my Grandmother for being able to support myself and my family.": "Steven",
  "But when you lose a family member or something tragic happens, that stays with you forever. You never get over it. Knowing that you have to deal with that for the rest of your life... Football is important, but not as important as you once thought it was.": "Brett",
  "My mother moved abroad when I was 11, my dad wasn't around from the time that I was a baby, so I was not the product of a family, but a product of observation - of watching what went on around me, of watching who I liked, what I didn't like, what I thought was good behavior and what I thought was bad behavior and tailoring myself accordingly.": "Mark",
  "Studies have shown that since women have had access to the pill and family planning measures, they have made huge gains in both wages and in careers that were dominated by men.": "Jennifer",
  "When families are strong and stable, so are children - showing higher levels of wellbeing and more positive outcomes. But when things go wrong - either through family breakdown or a damaged parental relationship - the impact on a child's later life can be devastating.": "Iain",
  "We're African-American and we work together as a family, so people assume we're like the Jacksons. But I didn't have parents using me to get out of a bad situation.": "Beyonce",
  "I was born in a middle class Muslim family, in a small town called Myonenningh in a northern part of Bangladesh in 1962. My father is a qualified physician; my mother is a housewife.

  "We've got some talented people in my family in regards to football, and we do it the right way.": "Clay",
  "I think Hispanic community - the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative. They are faith, family and patriotism. Do you know the rate of military enlistment among Hispanics is higher than any demographic in this country? And they are also hard work and responsibility.": "Ted",
  "One's family is the most important thing in life. I look at it this way: One of these days I'll be over in a hospital somewhere with four walls around me. And the only people who'll be with me will be my family.": "Robert",
  "I have frequently been questioned, especially by women, of how I could reconcile family life with a scientific career. Well, it has not been easy.": "Marie",
  "The Royal Family have always had an interest in a number of different areas of society. We are a part of society.": "Prince",
  "The hardworking men and women of this country identify with my father. He is tough, and he is persevering. He is honest, and he is real. He's an optimist, and he's a relentless believer in America and all of her potential. He loves his family, and he loves his country with his heart and his soul.": "Ivanka",
  "Family and moral values are so central to everything that I am.": "Marian",
  "The greenest home is the one you don't build. If you really want to save the Earth, move in with another family and share a house that's already built. Better yet, live in the forest and eat whatever the squirrels don't want.": "Scott",
  "I have a lot of friends, but my biggest fear is loneliness. I miss my family in Mumbai, and my biggest nightmare every day is to go back home alone.": "Deepika",
  "Humans have a fraught relationship with beasts. They are our companions and our chattel, our family members and our laborers, our household pets and our household pests. We love them and cage them, admire them and abuse them. And, of course, we cook and eat them.": "Jeffrey",
  "When it gets to the part in life where you're more afraid of what your wife is going to do to you than if you box, say, Mike Tyson, you've got to get a new profession. You don't get to be a family. I know why boxers never quit, some of them. They don't have wives.": "George",
  "We have a huge family history with Singapore because we have the duty-free shops in the airports. It's a very industrious city. It's beautiful, and Singaporeans have this wonderful desire for, and love of, luxury goods. You can see how well thought out and planned the city is with the best boutiques.": "Marie-Chantal",
  "I was raised in a dominantly Filipino family. I didn't know I was 'mixed' until I got older and started asking questions about my grandparents, the origins of our middle and last names. We were kind of textbook Pinoys. A lot of the Filipino stereotypes that were joked about by me and my friends rang very true with my family.": "Vincent",
  "For the first time ever I was taking the family on the road. We stayed with my in-laws, which on life's list of experiences ranks right below sitting in a tub full of scissors.": "Jeff",
  "No one can find inner peace except by working, not in a self- centered way, but for the whole human family.": "Peace",
  "There's a schizoid streak within the family anyway so I dare say that I'm affected by that. The majority of the people in my family have been in some kind of mental institution, as for my brother he doesn't want to leave. He likes it very much.": "David",
  "I can see how you could get dragged into the bad stuff, but I've got good friends around me, good family. I think I've got my head screwed on.": "Harry",
  "Every second, every day, every year, we fail to address demand for reproductive health and family planning services. Lives are lost, and girls' opportunities to thrive and contribute to their country's development shrink. These are real people.": "Jenny",
  "The people on my mum's side of the family are atheist intellectuals who are ueber-proper. My dad's side of the family are missionaries who are more comfortable sitting around in sweatpants than they are in a five-star restaurant. But those two influences converged in my life.": "Evangeline",
  "A family spirit is not always synonymous with family life. Bone of our bone and flesh of our flesh makes for brothers, sisters and relatives, who may be as distant as strangers in a foreign land.": "Mother",
  "So much of what is best in us is bound up in our love of family, that it remains the measure of our stability because it measures our sense of loyalty. All other pacts of love or fear derive from it and are modeled upon it.": "Haniel",
  "It's long been accepted as fact that the availability of family planning services saves lives. Where women have access to these services, children and families are healthier, and society at large benefits.": "Martha",
  "I have been called a nun with a switchblade where my privacy is concerned. I think there's a point where one says, that's for family, that's for me.": "Julie",
  "Her friends say she is very funny. At a family dinner, she stood to go, and the footman very properly pulled her chair away. At that moment I asked her a question and she sat down again, except there was no chair. Everyone, including the Queen, laughed and laughed.": "Prince",
  "Tradition is an element that enters into play with destiny, because you are born into a particular family - Jewish or Islamic or Christian or Mexican - and your family determines to some extent what you are expected to become. And society is always there attempting to determine the role we will play within it.": "Laura",
  "Perhaps the greatest social service that can be rendered by anybody to the country and to mankind is to bring up a family.": "George",

  "Back in the old days, when I was a child, we sat around the family table at dinner time and exchanged our daily experiences. It wasn't very organized, but everyone was recognized and all the news that had to be told was told by each family member. We listened to each other and the interest was not put on; it was real.": "Bob",
  "My mother never made me do anything for my brothers, like serve them. I think that's an important lesson, especially for the Latino culture, because the women are expected to be the ones that serve and cook and whatever. Not in our family. Everybody was equal.": "Dolores",
  "What is discipleship? It is primarily obedience to the Savior. Discipleship includes many things. It is chastity. It is tithing. It is family home evening. It is keeping all the commandments. It is forsaking anything that is not good for us.": "James",
  "Denmark is a country built on a commercial fleet. That's basically what we have been doing. We're just a small country of islands, and every family has a sailor. So, in many ways, my father was a sailor before I was born.": "Tobias",

  "My family and school life are important to me.": "Anna",
  "Those who say we should dismantle the role of Poet Laureate altogether, the trick they miss is that being called this thing, with the weight of tradition behind it, and with the association of the Royal family, does allow you to have conversations and to open doors, and wallets, for the good of poetry in a way that nothing else would allow.": "Andrew",
  "My family's story isn't special. What's special is the America that makes our story possible. Ours is a nation like no other, a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation. No matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward.": "Julian",
  "I work more now because at this time of my life I am not disturbed from my aim by outside pressures such as family, passionate relationships, dealing with 'who am I?' - those complications when one is searching for one's self.": "Jeanne",
  "I sailboat raced, I love to go out on my motorcycle alone, but I also love my family dearly. I love that aspect of my life as well.": "Bob",
  "I always wanted to go into the military or something like that - my whole family, all my friends are either Air Force, Navy, or Marines.": "RJ",
  "The greatest thing in family life is to take a hint when a hint is intended-and not to take a hint when a hint isn't intended.": "Robert",
  "Give a little love to a child, and you get a great deal back.": "John",

  "I need a life outside of soccer. So I very much welcome, you know, new love interests and dating and friends and family.": "Hope",
  "In Puerto Rico, we have a lot of traditions. We eat a very typical thing that's called 'pasteles' - it's almost like a tamale made of bananas, and we make it all together. Like, all the women of the family unite, and it's a very big deal, a very big thing.": "Joyce",
  "My goals have changed throughout my life. At one time it was winning awards, selling out concert dates, selling more albums than anyone else. Now, my goals are to see my grandchildren grown, live a long and healthy life with my family and friends and travel the world.": "Reba",
  "Maybe there is no actual place called hell. Maybe hell is just having to listen to our grandparents breathe through their noses when they're eating sandwiches.": "Jim",
  "All of us grow up in particular realities - a home, family, a clan, a small town, a neighborhood. Depending upon how we're brought up, we are either deeply aware of the particular reading of reality into which we are born, or we are peripherally aware of it.": "Chaim",
  "The family you come from isn't as important as the family you're going to have.": "Ring",

  "Everything has changed in recent decades - the economy, technology, cultural attitudes, the demographics of the workforce, the role of women in society and the structure of the American family.

  "When you come from a family of storytellers, you're doomed. You just have to tell stories.": "Patricia",

  "For me, there is no greater sunshine in politics or in life than to have a job, security for your family, a good school place where you know your child is going, and the sense that if I put in, there will be a decent, secure retirement at the end of it all.": "David",
  "What I don't miss is living in a small town where everybody knows you, your family, and what you ate for breakfast.": "Nancy",

  "When I had made more money than I needed for myself and my family, I set up a foundation to promote the values and principles of a free and open society.": "George",
  "If you walk down the street and see someone in a box, you have a choice. That person is either the other and you're fearful of them, or that person is an extension of your family. And that makes you at home in that world and not fearful. So really it's very self-serving.": "Susan",

  "Roots is not just a saga of my family. It is the symbolic saga of a people.": "Alex",

  "Do not let your bachelor ways crystallize so that you can't soften them when you come to have a wife and a family of your own.": "Rutherford",
  "I was lucky. My family is wonderful. And it's funny, because most of my best friends come from very large families. So it always felt as if I had lots of siblings, though in the end I had to leave them and go home. I kind of got the best of both worlds as a kid.": "Sophia",
  "And before our current legislature adjourns, we intend to become the first state of full and true choice by saying to every low and middle-income Hoosier family, if you think a non-government school is the right one for your child, you're as entitled to that option as any wealthy family; here's a voucher, go sign up.": "Mitch",

  "If you can capture the humanity of a family struggling in an economic crisis you can make a difference. You can raise awareness just of the simple humanity.": "Emily",
  "Being sent away to boarding school at seven is as great an inspiration as any songwriter could have - to be taken away from one's family and locked away for 10 years. It does create an incredible intensity of emotion.": "James",
  "I want to make sure my family's straight.": "Lil",

  "Around my house, I won't even speak to my family unless they first address me by my official Berzerker name, Godred Crovan, Victor of Sky-Hill and Ruler of Man and the Isles. And now that I think of it, that's probably why nobody speaks to me unless it's time to feed the dogs or take out the garbage.": "Zakk",
  "While I have felt lonely many times in my life, the oddest feeling of all was after my mother, Lucille, died. My father had already died, but I always had some attachment to our big family while she was alive. It seems strange to say now that I felt so lonely, yet I did.": "Bill",
  "My ideal travel companions are my family.": "Pharrell",

  "I always loved family holidays, and I had this vision and dream as a little girl of having a big family of my own.": "Brooke",
  "I don't believe in revenge. When people are bullies it's because of a deeper-rooted issue - either their family life is tough or they're being bullied by someone bigger than they are.": "Khloe",

  "My biggest hobby is hanging out with my family and kids.": "Joel",

  "My family was my guide to my reality.": "Haywood",
  "A family can develop only with a loving woman as its center.": "Karl",
  "I'm thankful to God for having a family that's been there for me. He's been there from the time I was a child to even now with my family helping with my little boy. It's worth more than words could ever describe. That's one of the ways I've been able to stay grounded is thanks to family and God.": "Ashton",
  "Since 2005, I have not spent much time with my family. In fact I have spent more time at the Taj Landsend in Mumbai. It was my 100th visit recently, which means I have spent more than 400 days in that hotel, and that is a lot more than I have spent with my family.": "Mahendra",

  "Only solitary men know the full joys of friendship. Others have their family; but to a solitary and an exile, his friends are everything.": "Willa",

  "A 'good' family, it seems, is one that used to be better.": "Cleveland",
  "In a big family the first child is kind of like the first pancake. If it's not perfect, that's okay, there are a lot more coming along.": "Antonin",
  "A plague on eminence! I hardly dare cross the street anymore without a convoy, and I am stared at wherever I go like an idiot member of a royal family or an animal in a zoo; and zoo animals have been known to die from stares.": "Igor",
  "To each other, we were as normal and nice as the smell of bread. We were just a family. In a family even exaggerations make perfect sense.": "John",

  "The great universal family of men is a utopia worthy of the most mediocre logic.": "Comte",
  "I have now disposed of all my property to my family. There is one thing more I wish I could give them, and that is the Christian religion.": "Patrick",
  "Had I not made it big, my family would have told me to recheck my decision. Now that I am successful, there is no way. They have to accept it gracefully.": "Amisha",
  "It's about time we all faced up to the truth. If we accept the radical homosexual agenda, be it in the military or in marriage or in other areas of our lives, we are utterly destroying the concept of family.": "Alan",

  "If I want to work, I can. If I want to play golf, or ride my motorcycle, I can. But the rest of it is family. Sometimes you're not really needed by your family, but you're there. And my kids like to know I'm there.": "Bob",
  "Life is about family and technology.": "Mark",
  "As much as I liked and admired the various members of the Kennedy family, my first loyalty was to Jackie.": "Pierre",

  "The family was not only the social unit, but also the unit of government.": "Charles",
  "It's the sense of what family is at the dinner table. It was the joy of knowing mother was in the kitchen making our favorite dish. I wish more people would do this and recall the joy of life.": "Paul",
  "Everything happens for a reason. I'm used to it, I prepare for it. Like I say, at the end of the day, those in charge of their own destiny are going to do what's right for them and their family.": "Shaquille",
  "We spent last night listening to Liverpool football team on the radio, wanting them to win so badly. Paul supports Liverpool. He was Everton for a while because of his family - but it's all Liverpool now.": "Linda",

You're almost in a haze because you don't really know where you are half the time: You're in a hotel room one moment, and the next thing you know, you're onstage performing for 60,000 people, then you're back on an airplane. It's very hectic and I couldn't do it without my family.": "Vanessa",

  "Automation and technology would be a great boon if it were creative, if there were more leisure, more opportunity to engage in raising a family, providing guidance to the young, all the stuff we say we need. America will work if we're all in it together. It'll work when there's a shared sense of destiny. It can be done!": "Jerry",

  "I'm at peace with my family, my friends, myself and God so there's really nothing else that I worry about.": "Lance",

  "I'll tell you, in my life I've never once have seen a Hispanic panhandler, because in our community, it would be viewed as shameful to be out on the street begging. Those are all conservative values - faith, family, hard work, responsibility.": "Ted",

  "In the richest country in the history of the world, this Obama economy has crushed the middle class. Family income has fallen by $4,000, but health insurance premiums are higher, food prices are higher, utility bills are higher, and gasoline prices have doubled. Today more Americans wake up in poverty than ever before.": "Mitt",
  "When I was a kid, I took 'The Brady Bunch' and 'The Partridge Family' very seriously. It was a world to me in the same way that the Greek myths would have been had I read them. You know, Marcia is Athena and Mr. Brady is Zeus.": "George",

  "Every summer my husband and I pack our suitcases, load our kids into the car, and drive from tense, crowded New York City to my family's cottage in Maine. It's on an island, with stretches of sea and sandy beaches, rocky coasts, and pine trees. We barbecue, swim, lie around, and try to do nothing.": "Hope",
  "I wanted to make a point of basing myself at home, being close to my family. I'll never be able to repay Mum and Dad for what they did, but at least they know they'll never have to work another day. I'll do whatever it takes to look after them.": "Rory",
  "I come from a political family. My father was a freedom fighter. He was a prominent leader of the locality and member of the Congress party. He spent 10 years in British prisons. In the evening, in our living room, the only subject we used to discuss was politics. So politics was not unfamiliar to me.": "Pranab",
  "I play with my grandchildren. I tend to my garden, which I love. Of course, I love to read, and family is really what it's all about.": "Julie",
  "Sweden is a small country and, well, our family's pretty prominent in that world, I guess. And I really didn't like the sound of just being 'the fourth acting Skarsgard.'": "Bill",
  "On the one hand, the idea of marriage and the sort of traditional family life repulses me. But on the other hand, I long for it, you know what I mean? I'm constantly in conflict with things. And it is because of my past and my upbringing and the journey that I've been on.": "Madonna",
  "What I really am is a homebody. I was a homebody even before I had a family. My days are filled with home stuff.": "Ray",
  "My father was brought up in an orphanage in the Catskills. He was a factory worker. And because his family wasn't there for him, family was everything. We could disagree inside the house, but outside the house it was us against the world. So when I became a drag actor, he looked sideways but said okay.": "Harvey",
  "I remember saying goodbye to my father the night he left to join the Navy. He didn't have to. He was older than other servicemen and had a family to support but he wanted to be a part of the fight against fascism, not just make movies about it. I admired this about him.": "Jane",
  "I always write things that entertain me, and one of the things that I find really enjoyable to explore is the idea of love. I like looking at my own life and my friends and family and how love changes who you are. It fascinates me.": "Stephenie",
  "Because sorry to say, women run the house. They run the family. They hold things up. I mean, it's like you don't ever see your mom get sick because she handles everything. And it's kind of amazing I think to show people just how strong women are.": "Sophia",
  "But I want to start a family one day, and be involved in more charities, helping children.": "Lily",
  "For me, family always comes first; I would do anything to protect them.": "Mark",
  "I love being around my friends and my family and spending time with my husband. I like being normal and recharging my batteries, and I feel like I have the coolest job in the world where I get to get on stage and perform and get to do a lot of really amazing things.": "Carrie",
  "I deeply appreciate the people of Michigan. I love their grit. I love the way they face life. I love the family values they have.": "Ernie",
  "The traditional spokespersons for the Evangelicals, such as Chuck Colson and James Dobson, have become alarmed about this drift away from the 'Family Values' issues that they believe should be the overwhelming concerns of Evangelicals. They have expressed their displeasure in letters of protest circulated through the religious media.": "Tony",
  "What I want to do is tell stories about normal people in the American suburbs. I don't write the book where it's a conspiracy reaching the prime minister; I don't write the book with the big serial killer who lops off heads. My setting is a very placid pool of suburbia, family life. And within that I can make pretty big splashes.": "Harlan",
  "I think of my shows as family reunions. I give 100% every time. I just do. It's a huge therapeutic release. Also I love my touring family. And I love my audiences very much.": "Paula",
  "You know, most people, they want to go to Hollywood. They want to be a star. They want to be a rock star. That thought never entered any of our minds, the Van Halen family.": "Eddie",
  "My family is my life, and I'll never lose that.": "Jessica",
  "We didn't have much money. My whole extended family used to help us, and buy us books and food. It was hard, and there were things I didn't want to talk about. But at the end I was a happy girl.": "Maria",
  "Being on 'Glee' was amazing. I remember my first day on set, my first day I arrived to the set I was in my trailer and all of the actors came and banged on my door - Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, Amber Riley, Naya Rivera. They all welcomed me with open arms, so it was a great experience. It felt like family, and I miss them a lot over there.": "NeNe",
  "I enjoy being busy, I really do. Remember, I'm the stub end of the railroad. I have no family, so I'm not taking busy time away from people that I should be spending it with. So I'm just relaxing and enjoying it.": "Betty",
  "I think family is so important.": "Jacqueline",
  "I really don't care what people think of me. I've got my family. I've got my friends. Yes, I have been trained to be a little more aggressive if I need to be, but I don't go around thumping people.": "Chris",
  "I come from an interracial family: My father is from Nigeria, and so he is African-American, and my mother is American and white, so I rarely see skin color. It's never an issue for me.": "Annie",
  "Victoria's Secret is like a big family.": "Candice",
  "But for me, I thought you made a record, you got on a bus, went out and played your shows and made a lot of money. That was the way it was supposed to go down. But there's a lot more to it than that. There are a lot of early mornings, late nights, a lot of traveling, a lot of being away from home, being away from your family.": "Jason",
  "When I was going on auditions, it was nerve-racking. I'd always say to my mom that it would be awesome if I could get a series. When Modern Family came along, I said, 'You know what, Mom? I believe I'm going to get this role.'": "Rico",
  "I grew up around a lot of various religions, so it's a part of my consciousness in a way. Everything from heavy Catholicism to followers of Indian spiritual masters to Unitarian universalists - all in one family. Though the family aspect was stronger than any particular dogma.": "St.",
  "I've never forgotten what it's like to be in your early twenties, which is not a particularly easy time. You've left your family, you've left the strictures of high school, and you're trying to break free and form yourself but you have to support yourself as well. We don't really give enough credence to that time of life and to its troubles.": "Julia",
  "My experiences in life are getting bigger and better. The more stuff I do, the more stuff I talk about - having kids, traveling, going through relationship problems, dealing with things in my own family. All that stuff builds character.": "Kevin",
  "My background is not typical hip-hop. I didn't grow up in the projects. I grew up in a single family home in a middle-class suburb. That doesn't mean I didn't experience hardship, but to me it's not about that, it's about the future and where we are trying to take it.": "Kid",
  "I would love to have a complete family. I'd love to do it all at once. I'd love to be able to give to my children what my parents were able to give to me. And if I'm blessed to be able to do that, fantastic. If I'm not, then life goes on. You have to do the best you can. I do think we have to bring the family back; I do.": "Michael",
  "I have mostly been terrified of listening to scary stories around a campfire. We camp a lot as a family, and at night my dad would try and tell us scary stories. This made eating s'mores difficult. The story would start with something like... 'and the old man who lived in these woods...' I would then run back into the camper terrified.": "Willow",
  "I'm not a royal family watcher.": "Bill",
  "I grew up in a family of secrets there was a lot of pathology in the family.": "Naomi",
  "America cannot continue to lead the family of nations around the world if we suffer the collapse of the family here at home.": "Mitt",
  "I've never had a divorce, but I've seen so many of my friends, my sister, my family go through that stuff, so I try to write for the people that can't write about it. I take on their sorrow, so I'm able to kind of express it, or their joy.": "Dolly",
  "People are pretty forgiving when it comes to other people's families. The only family that ever horrifies you is your own.": "Douglas",
  "First and foremost comes my family and my life with Brad. We have so much joy in raising our children and teaching them about the world that nothing really compares to that.": "Angelina",
  "Getting married and starting a family has been a lifelong goal and one that I have persevered through different paths up to it!": "Alanis",
  "The last thing family and friends want is for you to spend money on them that you don't have or that you can't really spare.": "Suze",
  "You don't have to give birth to someone to have a family.": "Sandra",
  "Also, my mom and family are very important to me and I know that this is not expected.": "Christina",
  "I love children and I get along with them great. It's just that I believe if you're going to be a parent, there has to be something inside you that says, 'I want a family.' I don't feel that sense of urgency.": "George",
  "If you see a black family, it's looting, but if it's a white family they are looking for food.": "Kanye",
  "We will invest in our people, quality education, job opportunity, family, neighborhood, and yes, a thing we call America.": "Dan",
  "We went to church every Sunday. When I was a kid, the only time I sang was around my family.": "Darius",
  "First of all there is always that artistic challenge of creating something. Or the particular experience to take slum life in that period and make something out of it in the form of a book. And then I felt some kind of responsibility to my family.": "Frank",
  "There's nothing like a family crisis, especially a divorce, to force a person to re-evaluate his life.": "Michael",
  "I'm not sure why no one wants to admit there's a viable audience out there that believes in God and wants to see a movie with their family. The demand is there. The supply is not.": "Tyler",
  "I had a number of very strong personalities in my family. My father was a concert flutist, the solo flute for Toscanini.": "Francis",
  "I grew up in a big family with a lot of kids around, and I definitely want to have children as well.": "Heidi",
  "A rescue mission doesn't involve going in and just taking a child and leaving. You can't just choose any child at random. Every kid has a case that is based on that child's original family. So, we made it over to a village, found the child; we were interacting with the child.": "Jason",
  "You can say I had a severe case of 'Roots' envy. I wanted to be like Alex Haley, and I wanted to be able to... do my family tree back to the slave ship and then reverse the Middle Passage, as I like to put it, and find the tribe or ethnic group that I was from in Africa.": "Henry",
  "I am the baby in the family, and I always will be. I am actually very happy to have that position. But I still get teased. I don't mind that.": "Janet",
  "At my core, what I think we need to do is to get the basics right again. We need to rebuild our family structure, stay away from redefining marriage, and stand by marriage as a union between a man and a woman.": "Sam",
  "It takes a lot of work to put together a marriage, to put together a family and a home.": "Elizabeth",
  "No one in my family was a reader of literary fiction. So, I didn't have encouragement, but I didn't have discouragement, because I don't think anybody knew what that meant.": "Amy",
  "My family kinda hit the skids. We were experiencing poverty at that point. We all got a job, where the whole family had to work as security guards and janitors. And I just got angry.": "Jim",
  "Tennis just a game, family is forever.": "Serena",
  "I have a great family, I live an amazing life.": "John",
  "As a general thing, when a woman wears the pants in a family, she has a good right to them.": "Josh",
  "Too often, older women are seen as victims, but I know lots of formidable women who have marvellous jobs as well as a full erotic life, and children and friends and family.": "Francesca",
  "Growing up in a particular neighborhood, growing up in a working-class family, not having much money, all of those things fire you and can give you an edge, can give you an anger.": "Gary",
  "Rarely do members of the same family grow up under the same roof.": "Richard",
  "In five years' time I'd like to be a mum. I want to settle down and have a family, definitely sooner rather than later. I'd like to have finished my second album too, maybe even my third. I'd like a sound that sticks around that other people are inspired by and that people know is me.": "Adele",
  "My family... always had the value of the family table and these cultural influences of growing up.": "Emeril",
  "Never write an advertisement which you wouldn't want your family to read. You wouldn't tell lies to your own wife. Don't tell them to mine.": "David",
  "My encounters with racism are sort of second-hand situations where I might be standing around with a group of white friends and someone makes a comment that they wouldn't make at my family reunion.": "Wentworth",
  "It's not an accident that both my sister and I are writers. Our parents created an accidental Petri dish. My family has great storytellers, and I grew up in a very funny, conversational house and didn't have television. This small family farm was a bubble world that didn't have much to do with reality.": "Elizabeth",
  "But I just felt at one point that I was on a hamster wheel, you know? Just doing movie after movie and thinking so much about career related things and I think missing out on hanging with my friends and family as much I needed to.": "Woody",
  "I have a lot of very close girlfriends and sisters - I'm from an all female family. My father often quips that even the cat was neutered!": "Shirley",
  "At a certain point I'm going to want to have a family.": "Gwen",
  "My mom always said I was the peacemaker in the family. My older brother, Eric, was the leader, the creative one. I was just his puppet.": "Gwen",
  "Finding that balance between work and family is the hardest thing I've ever done - by far.": "Gwen",
  "Dad kept us out of school, but school comes and goes. Family is forever.": "Charlie",
  "I grew up in Los Angeles in a Quaker family, and for me being Quaker was a political calling rather than a religious one.": "Bonnie",
  "It's not that our family has no taste, it's just that our family's taste is inconsistent.": "Dave",
  "My family took me to church when I was like 4 years old, and I had to be in a pageant, and I was playing Jesus.": "David",
  "A woman should be home with the children, building that home and making sure there's a secure family atmosphere.": "Mel",
  "Defend the church. Defend the family. Defend the non-profit community. Defend them against a government that wants to weaken them.": "Rick",
  "I would love a family. I'm at the age where the wish for a child gets stronger. But who knows.": "Cameron",
  "My family isn't really all that different from anyone else's. Well, maybe they're a bit more entertaining.": "David",
  "With the counseling of my family doctor, my mother ended up turning to Weight Watchers and their children's program. I went to weekly meetings, got counseling and would exercise with my peers who were my size. It was the first time I saw a proper children's portion size, and it wasn't two burgers, it was one.": "Ginnifer",
  "My kids give me the balance to live right.": "Celine",
  "I'm not much of a family man. I'm just not that into it. I love kids, I adore them, but I don't want to live my life for them.": "Sting",
  "The attempt to redefine the family as a purely voluntary arrangement grows out of the modern delusion that people can keep all their options open all the time.": "Christopher",
  "The left dismisses talk about the collapse of family life and talks instead about the emergence of the growing new diversity of family types.": "Christopher",
  "The left ask people to believe that there is no conflict between feminism and the family.": "Christopher",
  "Nobody in my family ever thought that I'd a be a model.": "Cindy",
  "I never did quite fit the glamour mode. It is life with my husband and family that is my high now.": "Patty",
  "For me, nothing has ever taken precedence over being a mother and having a family and a home.": "Jessica",
  "I am tortured when I am away from my family, from my children. I am horribly guilt-ridden.": "Jessica",
  "It would be nice if I did have a good relationship with my family, and yes, part of me longs to have a mum and dad who love and accept me for who I am. But if they never do, it's OK.": "Heather",
  "The family is inclusive of not just your genetic family, but the people that you meet along the way.": "Jane",
  "The foundation of family - that's where it all begins for me.": "Faith",
  "Marriage made more sense when it was indissoluble. It's the woman trying to cope with the strains of a one-parent family who will suffer most from the relaxation of the divorce laws.": "Germaine",
  "I had an uncle who was a postal official at the Polish post office in Gdansk. He was one of the defenders of the Polish postal service and, after it capitulated, was shot by the Germans under the provisions of martial law. Suddenly he was no longer a member of the family, and we were no longer allowed to play with his children.": "Gunter",
  "I don't have to look up my family tree, because I know that I'm the sap.": "Fred",
  "I've been pretty focused my entire life, and now that I have a family, I'm just going to keep that focus, but it's going to be a family focus.": "Wiz",
  "Police in China can do whatever they want; after 81 days in arbitrary detention you clearly realise that they don't have to obey their own laws. In a society like this there is no negotiation, no discussion, except to tell you that power can crush you any time they want - not only you, your whole family and all people like you.": "Ai",
  "God created the family to provide the maximum love and support and morality and example that one can imagine.": "Jerry",
  "Probably the worst time in a person's life is when they have to kill a family member because they are the devil. But otherwise it's been a pretty good day.": "Emo",
  "When I'm on my own, I can be negative. I need my friends and family around to help pick me up if I've had a bad qualifying session. I think insecurity plagues a lot of sportspeople.": "Jenson",
  "My health and my family are the core of my being.": "Jon",
  "For all of those willing to help me start a family, I am flattered. I will let you know when I need your help.": "Paula",
  "I would rather start a family than finish one.": "Don",
  "I love cooking for myself and cooking for my family.": "Al",
  "When I went to Philadelphia I was 26 years old and really sitting on top of the world. Family life, a professional career, plenty of friends and associates, and a good reputation, a wish list that could be the envy of many.": "Julius",
  "My family comes first. Maybe that's what makes me different from other guys.": "Bobby",
  "There is other disturbing facts surround the hideous 911 attacks, which my family and I could see from the third floor bathroom window of our homes!": "Amiri",

  "My family is Jewish, Buddhist, Baptist and Catholic. I don't believe in man-made religions.": "Whoopi",

  "My whole family could sing. My family harmonized without any instruments to accompany them.": "Ethel",
  "Alcoholism is a genetically predisposed disease and it does run in my family. I also think I felt like a misfit. I was in the South, everybody was blonde. I just didn't feel like I fitted in. It was sort of my way of fitting.": "Kristin",
  "Probably the earliest memories for me would be going to restaurants with my family.": "Alexander",
  "I am the family face; flesh perishes, I live on.": "Thomas",
  "I was aware of it, but I grew up in a very a-religious family. My mother never went to church, she never had any religious training or background. It was never a part of our social interaction.": "Donald",
  "I've realized as well after five years of being on the road that if I'm going to four or five months of my life to something even if I'm overpaid, it's four or five months of my life away from home, away from my son, away from family and friends. I better believe in it on some level even if it's a big movie.": "Colin",
  "For all Italian people, family is very important. We don't fight with our families.": "Domenico",
  "I think women are different, and I think having them in the room is crucial to a family comedy, ensemble comedy, television comedy, where half the eyeballs on your show are women.": "Dan",
  "I think I'm most proud of my family right now. I'm more into that then I've ever been. It also gives a new area to draw from in creativity with my songs.": "Merle",

  "One thing I can say about the Motown acts is that we were a family. That's not a myth.": "Smokey",

  "People tend to think of Brisbane as a sleepy, sub-topical place. I don't know. It's like Baltimore or something. I don't know. You would hear the family dramas going on behind closed doors.": "Geoffrey",
  "I realized my family was funny, because nobody ever wanted to leave our house.": "Anthony",
  "I noticed that no matter where I went in the country, there was this group of questions that got asked. I would track them and keep them in categories. Like body image, school, family, friendship, you name it, the emotional life of a teenage girl.": "Elizabeth",
  "I mean I love my family very much, but there is a difference when you're reuniting with your family outside of your hometown and reuniting in the family home.": "Debra",

  "I had a wonderful family including my aunts, uncles and cousins but they've all gone to heaven.": "Doris",
  "People say that having three orchestras is a crazy life, but it's better because you have three families. I want to have my own kids very soon. In future, I still want to conduct a lot, but less, to be with my family.": "Gustavo",

  "I've given it my all. I've done my best. Now, I'm ready with my family to begin the next phase of our lives.": "Richard",
  "Writing is a solitary occupation. Family, friends, and society are the natural enemies of the writer. He must be alone, uninterrupted, and slightly savage if he is to sustain and complete an undertaking.": "Jessamyn",
  "I've always been a strong family advocate. I had a wonderful family growing up.": "Cheryl",
  "I think as a child you know when it's time for your parents to split. You realise they love each other, but they're not in love with each other. And I think as a child it's much better for your parents to split than for them to stay and have dysfunction within the family.": "Abbie",
  "My schedule can be hectic, so I'm always trying to find time to see my friends and family.": "Jessica",
  "My family said that I wanted to act even when I was a child living on a tea plantation in the jungle in India.": "Julie",
  "I look to my family for my support. I'm fortunate to have a big family.": "Chris",
  "I dabbled a little bit in acting in high school, and then I forgot about it completely. And then at about 25 I went to a class. I don't think anybody in my family thought it was an intelligent choice. I don't think anybody thought I'd succeed, which is understandable. I think they were just happy that I was doing something.": "James",
  "You have to be funny about it and honest about it. You can't leave yourself out of that mix. You have to be honest enough to say, I'm that messed-up one in the family.": "Louie",

  "I don't think anyone has a normal family.": "Edward",
  "I doubt I'll ever do another book collaboration; I've been spoiled. Roger and I both happened to move to New Mexico at about the same time, when we each had a family of young kids to raise. Socializing seemed to lead naturally to working together.": "Fred",

  "And when I retired, trust me, not only did Nolan Ryan, but the entire Ryan family had withdrawals from baseball. And it was tough.": "Nolan",
  "Like all my family and class, I considered it a sign of weakness to show affection; to have been caught kissing my mother would have been a disgrace, and to have shown affection for my father would have been a disaster.": "Agnes",
  "Family, work, familiarity. Listen, if I had a magic wand and I could make myself really be happy, I'd zap me onto a farm. And I know nothing about farming.": "Scott",
  "I grew up in a family in which political issues were often discussed, and debated intensely.": "Joseph",
  "I stay in tune with my family and God.": "Regina",
  "That's not the part of the story that I'm interested in, anyway. The part that I'm interested in is all the personal stuff. I tried to base the powers on family archetypes.": "Brad",

  "My family background was deeply Christian.": "Abbe",
  "Children in a family are like flowers in a bouquet: there's always one determined to face in an opposite direction from the way the arranger desires.": "Marcelene",
  "I won the parental lottery. Most of the kids I grew up with either came from really fractured homes, or really violent ones. I went home to a very traditional, good Irish Catholic family.": "Dennis",
  "Theo does comedy now, and he's traveling around the country doing comedy, and I actually just saw him, he's from Louisiana, and I just saw him when I went home to visit my family in Louisiana. I saw his comedy show and he was brilliant.": "Trishelle",
  "I don't know much about my family history except that my father had straight black hair and his ancestors probably came from India.": "Trevor",
  "Soaring prescription drug costs have placed a tremendous strain on family budgets. They have also imposed a heavy burden on employers - both public and private - who are struggling to provide affordable health insurance coverage to their workers.": "Susan",
  "The one thing that kept our family together was the music. The only thing that our family would share emotionally was to have our dad cry over something the kids did with music.": "Dennis",
  "I think that people with differing points of view find common ground in 'Modern Family' is very flattering, and I'm appreciative of that.": "Steven",
  "My father suffered much and toiled painfully all his life, for he had no resources other than the proceeds of his trade from which to support himself and his wife and family.": "Albrecht",
  "My whole damn family was nice. I don't think I've imagined it. It's true. Maybe it has to do with being brought up as Christian Scientists. Half of my relatives were Readers or Practitioners in the church.": "Henry",
  "If I had no family, my wife and I would lead a much more romantic and nomadic existence.": "David",
  "I'm pretty much a good Catholic girl at heart and I believe in family. I also have a basic belief that God takes care of me. I believe in prayer, even though I'm not that religious. I just have that foundation from my family. I mean when you think that you're just a human being and one of God's creatures, you can't take anything that seriously.": "Catherine",
  "I felt like I was betraying my family. But I knew that trying to explain my emotions in a movie like this was more important than leaving them unspoken.": "John",
  "A woman can take care of the family. It takes a man to provide structure, to provide stability.": "Tom",

  "I love my family.": "Manute",
  "I wish I had it in my power to furnish you with accommodation I should feel proud to do it, shall be happy to hear from you at anytime when you engagements will allow you an hour and remain with best wishes for yourself, family and circuit.": "John",
  "It's been a great adventure, everything I hoped for. But it's time to go home. I miss my family. I miss the Earth.": "John",
  "Plays are always about intense relationships, whether they're intense love relationships or family relationships or existential relationships.": "David",
  "When I've had hard times in my life, the one thing about being in TV is that it's positive. I withdrew to 'Cheers,' it was familiar in that it was family. It had a kind of realistic positiveness to it.": "Bruno",
  "Family life itself, that safest, most traditional, most approved of female choices, is not a sanctuary: It is, perpetually, a dangerous place.": "Margaret",
  "We fought during 'The Wall,' which was an album Waters wrote, based on his family story, we clashed long before that, during the period of the Dark Side and 'Wish You Were Here.' Actually, we never got along.": "Rick",
  "God did not intend the human family to be wafted to heaven on flowery beds of ease.": "Frank",
  "When my family all got together, I'd always get up and entertain everyone, but it was all a bit of a joke. My first real memory of singing for people was when I was about eleven or 12.": "Duffy",
  "Parents need all the help they can get. The strongest as well as the most fragile family requires a vital network of social supports.": "Bernice",
  "A young musician plays scales in his room and only bores his family. A beginning writer, on the other hand, sometimes has the misfortune of getting into print.": "Marguerite",
  "I'm always going back to one thing - my family... It's my family, my religion, my fighters. Put them in any order you want.": "Lou",

  "Fashion is architecture: it is a matter of proportions.": "Coco",
  "Good buildings come from good people, and all problems are solved by good design.": "Stephen",
  "I don't think that architecture is only about shelter, is only about a very simple enclosure. It should be able to excite you, to calm you, to make you think.": "Zaha",
  "I enjoy art, architecture, museums, churches and temples; anything that gives me insight into the history and soul of the place I'm in. I can also be a beach bum - I like to laze in the shade of a palm tree with a good book or float in a warm sea at sundown.": "Cherie",
  "My buildings will be my legacy... they will speak for me long after I'm gone.": "Julia",

  "Architecture starts when you carefully put two bricks together. There it begins.": "Ludwig",
  "The two elements the traveler first captures in the big city are extra human architecture and furious rhythm. Geometry and anguish.": "Federico",

  "We are called to be architects of the future, not its victims.": "R.",
  "I try to give people a different way of looking at their surroundings. That's art to me.": "Maya",
  "Chicago is known for good steaks, expensive stores and beautiful architecture. Unfortunately, the Windy City also enjoys a reputation for corrupt politics, violent crime, and some of the strictest gun control laws anywhere in the country.": "Bob",
  "Switzerland is a small, steep country, much more up and down than sideways, and is all stuck over with large brown hotels built on the cuckoo clock style of architecture.": "Ernest",
  "Color in certain places has the great value of making the outlines and structural planes seem more energetic.": "Antoni",
  "There is a powerful need for symbolism, and that means the architecture must have something that appeals to the human heart. There is a powerful need for symbolism, and that means the architecture must have something that appeals to the human heart.": "Kenzo",
  "A house is a machine for living in.": "Le",
  "A great building must begin with the unmeasurable, must go through measurable means when it is being designed and in the end must be unmeasurable.": "Louis",
  "Jobs offshoring began with manufacturing, but the rise of the high-speed Internet made it possible to move offshore tradable professional skills, such as software engineering, information technology, various forms of engineering, architecture, accounting, and even the medical reading of MRIs and CT-Scans.": "Paul",

  "Infrastructure is much more important than architecture.": "Rem",
  "The difference between good and bad architecture is the time you spend on it.": "David",
  "I truly believe that the great heroes that create the history of architecture are people who take risks and write to tell about it.": "Peter",

  "Architecture is art, nothing else.": "Philip",

  "Architecture aims at Eternity.": "Christopher",
  "Charleston has something for everyone, rain or shine. Its architecture is unparalleled. Carriage rides are great for seeing the city and hearing the history behind certain houses and the area.": "Thomas",
  "What is now called 'green architecture' is an opportunistic caricature of a much deeper consideration of the issues related to sustainability that architecture has been engaged with for many years. It was one of the first professions that was deeply concerned with these issues and that had an intellectual response to them.": "Rem",
  "I paint mostly from real life. It has to start with that. Real people, real street scenes, behind the curtain scenes, live models, paintings, photographs, staged setups, architecture, grids, graphic design. Whatever it takes to make it work.": "Bob",
  "The loftier the building, the deeper must the foundation be laid.": "Thomas",
  "For me, architecture is the means, not the end. It's a means of making different life forms possible.": "Bjarke",

  "It is impossible, as impossible as to raise the dead, to restore anything that has ever been great or beautiful in architecture. That which I have insisted upon as the life of the whole, that spirit which is given only by the hand and eye of the workman, can never be recalled.": "John",
  "It must be understood that every architecture is bound to its time and manifests itself only in vital tasks and through the materials of its age. It has never been otherwise.": "Ludwig",

  "Bridges are perhaps the most invisible form of public architecture.": "Bruce",
  "Seeing architecture differently from the way you see the rest of life is a bit weird. I believe one should be consistent in all that one does, from the books you read to the way you bring up your children. Everything you do is connected.": "David",
  "As a woman, I'm expected to want everything to be nice and to be nice myself. A very English thing. I don't design nice buildings - I don't like them. I like architecture to have some raw, vital, earthy quality.": "Zaha",

  "Rome has not seen a modern building in more than half a century. It is a city frozen in time.": "Richard",
  "To work in architecture you are so much involved with society, with politics, with bureaucrats. It's a very complicated process to do large projects. You start to see the society, how it functions, how it works. Then you have a lot of criticism about how it works.": "Ai",

  "Consider the momentous event in architecture when the wall parted and the column became.": "Louis",
  "The terrifying and edible beauty of Art Nouveau architecture.": "Salvador",
  "You have to accept as an architect to be exposed to criticism. Architecture should not rely on full harmony.": "Renzo",
  "Washington, D.C., has everything that Rome, Paris and London have in the way of great architecture - great power bases. Washington has obelisks and pyramids and underground tunnels and great art and a whole shadow world that we really don't see.": "Dan",
  "My architecture tends to be legible, light and flexible. You can read it. You look at a building, and you can see how it is constructed. I put the structure outside.": "Richard",
  "In graduate school, I decide to write my doctoral thesis on how Italian architecture influenced English playwrights of the seventeenth century. I wonder why certain playwrights decided to set their tragedies, written in English, in Italian palaces.": "Jhumpa",
  "It is good to learn from the ancients. I'm a bit of an ancient myself. They had a lot of time to think about architecture and landscape.": "I.",
  "Maybe we can show government how to operate better as a result of better architecture. Eventually, I think Chicago will be the most beautiful great city left in the world.": "Frank",

  "In architecture and interiors, as well as fashion, there is an interaction that is both functional and aesthetic.": "Joseph",
  "To make architecture with any real value is a massive challenge.": "Thomas",
  "A building that has great environmental responsibility is a political animal in a way because it becomes promotional of a cause. I think that kind of advocacy through architecture is really good.": "Antoine",

  "The ultimate pleasure of architecture lies in the most forbidden parts of the architectural act, where limits are perverted and prohibitions are transgressed.": "Bernard",
  "Before the professionalization of architecture in the nineteenth century, it was standard for an aspiring mason or carpenter to begin his apprenticeship at fourteen and to become a master builder by his early twenties.": "Martin",
  "London is one of the most civilised places in the world for the procedure of making architecture and urban design.": "Renzo",
  "Quebec City is the most European of any city in North America; they speak French all the time. There is a part of town called Old Quebec which is really like being in France. The architecture is just gorgeous, food, shopping. I'd say Quebec City is the most beautiful city in North America I've seen.": "Sebastian",
  "I'm a designer, which includes interiors, architecture, fashion, furniture, and lifestyle.": "Kelly",
  "A world of few choices, whether in jeans or mates, is a world in which individual differences become sources of alienation, unhappiness, even self-loathing. If no jeans fit, you'll feel uncomfortable or inferior. If no housing developments reflect your taste for unique architecture, you'll write screeds against philistine mass culture.": "Virginia",
  "Architecture is a result of a process of asking questions and testing them and re-interrogating and changing in a repetitive way.": "Thom",

  "I don't see that any buildings should be excluded from the term architecture, as long as they are done properly.": "Arne",
  "In architecture the idea degenerated. Design allows a more direct and pleasurable route.": "Charles",
  "Look, architecture has a lot of places to hide behind, a lot of excuses. 'The client made me do this.' 'The city made me do this.' 'Oh, the budget.' I don't believe that anymore.": "Frank",
  "Just as it takes time for a speck of fish spawn to develop into a fully grown fish, so, too, we need time for everything that develops and crystallizes in the world of ideas. Architecture demands more of this time than other creative work.": "Alvar",
  "What's interesting about architects is, we always have tried to justify beauty by looking to nature, and arguably, beautiful architecture has always been looking at a model of nature.": "Greg",
  "I didn't even have a clear idea of why I wanted to go to Oxford - apart from the fact I had fallen in love with the architecture. It certainly wasn't out of some great sense of academic or intellectual achievement. In many ways, my education only began after I'd left university.": "Alan",
  "I don't really get into architecture in the hotel room. But maybe a little Feng Shui here and there.": "Drew",
  "I have played a few times in Barcelona, including the fantastic Olympic Stadium. It's undoubtedly one of my favourite cities in terms of the people, arts, food, architecture and design.": "Jean-Michel"
