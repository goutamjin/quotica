{
  "When I'm on stage, it's really intense. My mind is going a million miles an hour, trying to remember my act, trying to say it all the right way. It's funny how different it looks and how it's happening. There are three Fellini circuses in my head, and outwardly it looks like I'm going to get a bagel.": "Steven",
  "You know how old I am? I'm so old, I remember when Letterman used to be funny and it was presidents who were serious. That's how old I am.": "Rush",
  "The superfluous, a very necessary thing.": "Voltaire",
  "It's funny how you never think about the women you've had. It's always the ones who get away that you can't forget.": "Chuck",
  "I'm odd looking. Sometimes I think I look like a funny muppet.": "Angelina",
  "Believe it or not, I make myself laugh. Sometimes when I have thoughts or say some things that are funny, it just makes me laugh, and I don't mind laughing at it before you guys do.": "Kevin",
  "The funny thing is people won't let me pay for things. I'll be in a restaurant and the manager will say, 'Oh no, it's on the house.'": "Richard",
  "I never expected to see the day when girls would get sunburned in the places they now do.": "Will",
  "It is not funny that anything else should fall down only that a man should fall down. Why do we laugh? Because it is a gravely religious matter: it is the Fall of Man. Only man can be absurd: for only man can be dignified. ": "Gilbert",
  "I knew exactly what to do on Alien, it was funny.": "Ridley",
  "When you're in the editing room, the dangerous thing is that it becomes like telling a joke again and again and again. Eventually, the joke starts to not be funny. So you have to be careful that you're not throwing the baby out with the bath water.": "Ridley",
  "You need to be silly to be funny.": "William",
  "I used to stutter really badly. Everybody thinks it's funny. And it's not funny. It's not.": "Joe",
  "We'll love you just the way you are if you're perfect.": "Alanis",
  "Parents are the last people on earth who ought to have children.": "Samuel",
  "As for our majority... one is enough.": "Benjamin",
  "Forty for you, sixty for me. And equal partners we will be.": "Joan",
  "When I'm being funny, I try not to offend. I don't think much of what I've done has been in really ghastly taste. I don't think I have embarrassed many people or distressed them.": "Kurt",
  "The tricky thing becomes: Do you know yourself well enough to then portray that on screen? And for me, I find that really hard. I'd rather hide behind accents and funny walks.": "Joel",
  "From my perspective, probably women are won over by people who are sweet and respectful and courteous and kind and funny. I think those are the things that win women over.": "Zooey",
  "I'm smart and I can be really funny and interesting and I can go toe-to-toe with anybody in a conversation.": "Megan",
  "I've always found it easier to be funny than to be serious.": "Molly",
  "Who included me among the ranks of the human race?": "Joseph",
  "The easiest time to be funny is during a fairly serious situation. That way, you can break the ice. It's crazy, but even at funerals, people will get huge laughs.": "Adam",
  "There's a funny thing about fame. The truth is you run as fast as you can towards it because it's everything you want. Not just the fame but what it represents, meaning work, meaning opportunity. And then you get there, and it's shocking how immediately you become enveloped in this world that is incredibly restricting.": "George",
  "I never smoked. I never drank and I never took drugs. The funny thing is, nothing is more boring, people like this. For me, it's OK. But most of my friends, at least they smoke and drink.": "Karl",
  "What's David's role? David looks good, that's what David does. David looks good, and I'm the funny one, that's what I hear constantly. But I keep telling him that looks fade.": "Victoria",
  "I like Ben Stein. I think he's funny, creative, and an insightful commentator on a host of issues.": "Chuck",
  "It may sound funny, but it's true: I tried to put myself through the 12-step program. I didn't want to attend a real meeting; my role didn't really require that, and I feel those meetings are sort of sacred, and they're anonymous for a reason. I tried to deal with some of my love of snacks - and I relapsed a lot.": "Octavia",
  "You have to discover when you're inadequate to be funny and you don't know you're inadequate when you're a kid.": "Larry",
  "Plus, I love comic writing. Nothing satisfies me more than finding a funny way to phrase something.": "Michael",
  "I can't be funny if my feet don't feel right.": "Billy",
  "It's funny, in a way the actor is a writer. It's not like the two things are so separate as to be like apples and oranges. The writer and the actor are one.": "Sam",
  "To label me an intellectual is a misunderstanding of what that is.": "Dick",
  "It's funny; recently I've started to notice people's impersonations of me, and it's basically like a hyperactive child.": "Dave",
  "In my film 'Queen', there was a funny moment with the bra. My director called and said they are blurring the bra. They said it is vulgar. Our director was furious about it. We are artistes... We see props as they are. A woman's bra is not a danger to the society.": "Kangana",
  "I'm opening up my heart to the idea of dating. It's funny - my friends would always come to me for romantic advice. I know nothing, and things have changed since I was dating in high school! I'm really trying hard to spend this time working on myself.": "Olivia",
  "All directors are control freaks and very obsessive. I get the feeling that directors as kids, they all have had a childhood with not too much contact with other kids. They constructed their own reality and they continue to do it. It's a funny breed, directors.": "Stellan",
  "It's funny as I get older I'm reverting to my roots - I want to plant stuff.": "Melissa",
  "It's a weird thing. Rick Springfield wrote 'Jessie's Girl,' and he probably gets sick of talking about 'Jessie's Girl.' The thing is, I didn't write 'Blurred Lines.' I didn't direct the music video. I'm really happy for the success, but it is kind of a funny thing to follow me around.": "Emily",
  "I think a lot of stuff I find funny is from day dreaming.": "Demetri",
  "I think since I was kid people told me that they thought I was funny.": "Demetri",
  "I'm surrounded by friends and family who are not that impressed by celebrity. They don't have any problem telling me I'm acting like an idiot or I'm not that funny.": "Paloma",
  "I think it's funny to be delicate with subjects that are explosive.": "Jerry",
  "I'm a pretty funny guy, and I would love to do a comedy with a bunch of funny guys - movie-star guys, where they could help me through it.": "LeBron",
  "What's funny is that the idea of popularity - even the use of the word 'popular' - is something that had been mostly absent from my life since junior high. In fact, the hallmark of life after junior high seemed to be the shedding of popularity as a central concern.": "Susan",
  "The funny thing about directing is that you have your own opinions, but it's a collaboration. Directing is a group effort. Even though you might think something works, the smartest thing you can do as a director is try and weigh the opinions of the people around you.": "Chris",
  "It's funny how a chubby kid can just be having fun, and people call it entertainment!": "Garth",
  "It's funny, but you get to a time in your life when you think you have all the friends you will ever have.": "Liam",
  "It's funny because I think that both France and Britain are known for their distinctive styles, and everyone says that France is so chic and elegant but I think, more than that, French women are renowned for dressing in what suits them.": "Alexa",
  "If you imagine yourself to be someone who is very uncomfortable in their own skin, then it does funny things to your voice.": "Rebecca",
  "What's interesting about Laurel and Hardy is that in most comedy teams, there's a straight man, and then there's the funny guy. And with Laurel and Hardy, they're both the funny guy.": "Christopher",
  "People say funny things all the time during really serious moments in life.": "Mark",
  "My sister and I - she's a musician - we jam all the time. We always play around for giggles with stuff that seem unconventional or stuff that seems funny. A lot of the stuff sometimes is just a response from jam sessions in her room, so she'll be on the guitar or the keyboard, and we'll just start singing and doing stuff.": "Andra",
  "Before the Kennedys were elected, there had been older Presidents. Then here was this devastatingly attractive young couple with two beautiful children. They were so intelligent, graceful, gracious and funny. They enjoyed life so much. That's what caught America's eye.": "Letitia",
  "All my children inherited perfect pitch.": "Chevy",
  "Parrots make great pets. They have more personality than goldfish.": "Chevy",
  "I would love to do a movie with Albert Brooks; we're so different, but I find him so funny, and I can be just as seemingly narcissistic as he comes off, the 'it's all about me' kind of thing.": "Chevy",
  "It's funny when people say, 'I don't think Julia likes me.' Honey, if I don't like you, you're going to know about it.": "Julia",
  "The follow your dreams thing is really important because so many people are railroaded into taking other paths by their family, their friends, people who should be supportive going, 'What are you talking about?' Even just seemingly regular career paths, but if it's not what people expect for you they kind of react funny.": "Joan",
  "I have a very low level of recognition, which is fine by me.": "Dylan",
  "The first day one is a guest, the second a burden, and the third a pest.": "Jean",
  "Do I like being thought of as attractive? I don't know anyone on Earth who doesn't, but I do find it funny.": "Benedict",
  "I find it very easy playing Bond. I think he's hilarious. He gets himself into some extraordinarily funny situations.": "Daniel",
  "I mean, I - it's so funny, I am, you know, I am, you know, a working woman out in the world, but I still live with my parents half the time. I've been sort of taking this very long, stuttering period of moving out.": "Lena",
  "I never thought of myself as like, a funny person.": "Lena",
  "It is a scientific fact that your body will not absorb cholesterol if you take it from another person's plate.": "Dave",
  "Life's pretty funny when you're objectively on the outside looking at it.": "Philip",
  "Have enough sense to know, ahead of time, when your skills will not extend to wallpapering.": "Marilyn",
  "Things can be funny when people are uneasy. It softens them up and stops them falling asleep on the sofa. I like those moments where people half-smile and half-wince.": "Mark",
  "I look at old performance videos now, and it's really funny - I thought I was such a gangster!": "Becky",
  "One of the funny things in life to me is a guy who takes himself very seriously.": "Dennis",
  "Every man has his follies - and often they are the most interesting thing he has got.": "Josh",
  "Flattery is like cologne water, to be smelt, not swallowed.": "Josh",
  "Working for President Nixon was the most extraordinary professional experience of my life. He was endlessly fascinating: brilliant, visionary, kind, generous, warm, funny - and yes, a good man.": "Monica",
  "I think our Batman had to be fun, light-hearted, funny, tongue-in-cheek... and I think that made kind of an homage to those earlier comic books, where Batman always had a quip or something.": "Adam",
  "I have the curse of thinking funny!": "Adam",
  "I'm an unorthodox type of guy, a funny guy - at least I think I'm funny. And one of the things I like to do is come up with nicknames for myself.": "Shaquille",
  "It's funny because being comedic and happy and lighthearted is who I am as a person, so they're easier emotions for me to connect with.": "Lindsay",
  "The guys on the stunt team are really fantastic. It's really funny, because for all the aggression they have to display on screen, they're actually really happy, good- natured people.": "Miranda",
  "It's funny when you're a kid how you can acclimate to almost anything.": "Adam",
  "When I was a little kid, I wrote this play about all these characters living in a haunted house. There was a witch who lived there, and a mummy. When they were all hassling him, this guy who bought the house - I can't believe I remember this - he said to them, 'Who's paying the mortgage on this haunted house?' I thought that was really funny.": "Mindy",
  "I grew up in a funny way.": "Gordon",
  "It's painful for me to watch someone who isn't funny. It's horrifying to sit in the back and watch some guy who just totally sucks.": "Joe",
  "I have this weird obsession with kids and old people falling. Like, funny falls. It is awful, but it's the thing that makes me laugh the most.": "Malin",
  "I get called 'the girl off the dancing horse.' I just laugh; I think it's really funny. It's true, isn't it? It's great we're getting that recognition.": "Charlotte",
  "I can speak Esperanto like a native.": "Spike",
  "Progress was all right. Only it went on too long.": "James",
  "I don't hate humanity and I'm not interested in people who do. Although, it's funny, actually, some of my favorite writers really do. Like Martin Amis. My dirty secret. 'London Fields' is one of my favorite books ever. And it's indefensible! But he's so funny... I forgive him everything.": "Elizabeth",
  "To be thrown onto the stand-up stage is an experience that you cannot fathom until you're actually there, because there's no place to go, and everyone is looking at you and you can't even see them because of the lights. And yet you have to manage to start talking and be funny on top of it.": "Garry",
  "But I think you can make fun of anything as long as it's funny enough.": "Sarah",
  "I saw 28 Days. I don't remember rehab being like a day camp or being that funny. Rehab is a dumping ground. It's a big landfill.": "Charlie",
  "I've started looking at my own father a bit funny. He assures me, though, that I really am the son of a Scottish postman.": "Craig",
  "I have six locks on my door all in a row. When I go out, I lock every other one. I figure no matter how long somebody stands there picking the locks, they are always locking three.": "Elayne",
  "I don't mean to sound - I don't want it to come out funny, but I don't like show business. I love - I love acting in films. I love it.": "Gene",
  "I don't think anyone should write their autobiography until after they're dead.": "Samuel",
  "One man's folly is another man's wife.": "Helen",
  "Acting is all about big hair and funny props... All the great actors knew it. Olivier knew it, Brando knew it.": "Harold",
  "One of the things I like about acting is that, in a funny way, I come back to myself.": "Bill",
  "It's funny because I'm a sucker for glitz and glitter when it comes to clothes and nail polish, but with my makeup, I'm more comfortable with a natural look. It feels more like me.": "Alison",
  "As soon as I realized you could be funny as a job, that was the job I wanted.": "Seth",
  "I'm like the master of ceremonies being funny, and then sometimes people you're with, girlfriends and stuff, are like, 'God I wish I had the person on stage to be with all the time.'": "Artie",
  "Sometimes when you write something on the page, it can seem very funny, but when you act it out - and this happens to me a lot, actually - the melancholy of the situation becomes more front and center.": "Mike",
  "Often, joking for me is a way of diffusing the awkwardness of a situation, so it's kind of exhilarating to be a part of projects where there's nothing funny or lighthearted.": "Emma",
  "I will say this about the truth - that it's one of those crisis rules, whether you are a client or someone who's living their life just every day - is that the truth has a funny way of not going away, and telling the truth is extremely important in dealing with any problem or crisis.": "Judy",
  "I joke around a lot about the manic times because they're funny. We manics do outrageous things and it is part of our colorful nature.": "Patty",
  "If love is the answer, could you please rephrase the question?": "Lily",
  "Working with Chaplin was very amusing and strange. His films are so funny, but working with him, I found him to be a very serious man. Whereas the films of Hitchcock are macabre, he could be a very funny man to work with, always telling jokes and holding court. Of course, when I worked with Charlie he was getting older.": "Tippi",
  "In a funny way, poems are suited to modern life. They're short, they're intense. Nobody has time to read a 700-page book. People read magazines, and a poem takes less time than an article.": "Caroline",
  "I'm sure that my parents' behavior has entered my work, I'm sorry to say. I don't think you need to have a difficult childhood to be funny, but it helps.": "Roz",
  "I do find comedy difficult. I don't know why. Maybe I think about it too much. There's a tremendous amount of pressure to be funny.": "Michelle",
  "As I get older, I just prefer to knit.": "Tracey",
  "I think serial monogamy says it all.": "Tracey",
  "The last time I saw him he was walking down lover's lane holding his own hand.": "Fred",
  "How many people here have telekenetic powers? Raise my hand.": "Emo",
  "I've always enjoyed making people laugh. But in order for me to be funny, I have to get ticked off about something.": "Carl",
  "Chris Hemsworth is like Christopher Reeve in that he can do two things: he can wear a big red cape without a shred of self-consciousness. But he's also funny as hell, and he's so sweet. So with all the fish-out-of-water stuff, he's so funny. So he does almost two jobs in a way.": "Tom",
  "I would call it a comedy variety show. We have some people just doing straight standup. We usually try to have one musical act of sort. So its just people being funny in different ways, not just sketch, not just standup, not just characters, all of those things.": "Todd",
  "I'm not one to sit here and judge here. But I think it's funny that the people that condemn the adult industry the most are the ones consuming the product the most.": "Sasha",
  "I'm somebody who believes in funny things, and laughing, but I do like for them to come from a place that addresses the human condition.": "Natasha",
  "You can't make everybody laugh. You gotta just do what you think is funny. Just be obstreperous to everybody.": "Colin",
  "Whenever a film allows you to think and feel and take it beyond the moment, I think it's achieved something. And 'Funny Games' does that.": "Naomi",
  "I started writing when I was 9 years old. I was like this weird kid who would just stay in my room, typing little funny magazines and drawing comic strips.": "R.",
  "The magic in performing as an entertaining ventriloquist happens when the characters come to life and the interaction between the separate personalities on stage becomes 'real.' Then don't forget that the act has to be funny, and to me, being funny and entertaining any given audience is more important than anything.": "Jeff",
  "I've always said that instead of watching a guy juggle seven things amazingly I would rather see a really bad juggler who's really funny.": "Jeff",
  "I'm one of those hovering mothers and I know it's really important to have an independent child, so I'm trying to back off, but it's hard. I love him so much, and he's so funny and cute to me.": "Selma",
  "It's funny, but to me, when you go to a concert hall and hear electronic pieces from the '60s, I think they sound really dated. But when an orchestra plays a piece from that period, and it's going to sound different every time, it feels more modern to me.": "Jonny",
  "I'm good at coming up with wacky characters and funny dialogue.": "Marlon",
  "How can you analyse what is funny? What's funny to one isn't funny to another... What's funny to you is a personal thing.": "Les",
  "I'm doing a pilot for Comedy Central with the band Steel Panther. They're faux heavy metal. They started as kind of a tribute band out here, or a cover band, and they're funny guys, and they just sort of morphed into their own thing.": "Brian",
  "What you do with it and things like that, but I basically chose this after I read it because I thought it was different and funny and unique and dark - things that I like to do.": "Danny",
  "I sang in the choir for years, even though my family belonged to another church.": "Paul",
  "I wish I had the nerve not to tip.": "Paul",
  "I don't know who the hell Paul Lynde is, or why he's funny, and I prefer it to be a mystery to me.": "Paul",
  "I realized I was gay in the shower one day with Barbra Streisand. It happened while I was lathering, rinsing, and repeating with Pert Plus. As I was belting out the chorus to my favorite song from 'Funny Girl,' 'Oh my man, I love him so, he'll never know...' it hit me.": "Ross",
  "It's funny, because I did all of these interviews as soon as I had the baby, and they were asking questions, and I really didn't have an idea of anything, because I was so blurry.": "Emily",
  "I've never gotten to do romantic comedy like most of the girls. Maybe because I'm fit, people assume that I'm not funny?": "Jessica",
  "Yes, I believe blue material is funny, but if that's all you've got, you're dead in the water. It's not good.": "Howard",
  "I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from.": "Eddie",
  "I mean, sometimes... a comedian becomes an actor, and they just don't deliver, because the bottom line of comedy is to be funny, and the bottom line of acting is to be truthful, and they get that mixed up sometimes, or don't even notice that that's the thing.": "Eddie",
  "It's a funny relationship that makeup artists have. I always feel kind of like a dentist. People look at me and think of pain.": "Rick",
  "Sometimes I am so dry that people don't know I'm kidding and think I'm being serious. I enjoy this because their reactions are often funny.": "Robert",
  "I don't have a bank account because I don't know my mother's maiden name.": "Paula",
  "I'm kidding about having only a few dollars. I might have a few dollars more.": "James",
  "There's something that's really fun about the challenge of making the mundane funny, too, I think.": "Jim",
  "It all started when my dog began getting free roll over minutes.": "Jay",
  "I recorded my hair this morning, tonight I'm watching the highlights.": "Jay",
  "I realised that if you get yourself labeled as the funny one, people don't look any further. I've used that as I've got older. It's controlling: I decide what part of my personality you're seeing. I don't want you to look at me, I really don't. I don't want you to comment on my clothes, my hair or the way I look.": "Catherine",
  "You know, I'm just a very boring, not very funny person in person. I don't feel pressured to be otherwise.": "Lorrie",
  "The best measure of a man's honesty isn't his income tax return. It's the zero adjust on his bathroom scale.": "Arthur",
  "Also, in a funny way, if you have been happily married there are no unresolved areas, nothing to prove to yourself after the other dies.": "Nigella",
  "I remember watching Gilda Radner when I was a kid and everyone thought she was so funny and no one ever said that she was a funny woman, she was just funny.": "Rachel",
  "Jon Stewart hires people that he thinks are funny. That's it. That's the only requirement.": "Olivia",
  "They're great girls. They're very funny, they're very smart, they're fun to be with. They're very lively, as I think people can tell. And you know, they're very confident girls.": "Laura",
  "What's funny about the slacker thing, people project an image of what they think a musician is: young, slack, unemployed - like a really romantic idea of a poet, writer or musician - which isn't really true a lot of the time. I don't reckon you would know anything about me if I wasn't moderately hard-working.": "Courtney",
  "It is to be observed that 'angling' is the name given to fishing by people who can't fish.": "Stephen",
  "It's so funny, because when I was growing up in a small town in New Hampshire, I was obsessed with Leonardo DiCaprio - from the 'Growing Pains'/'What's Eating Gilbert Grape' era, because he was superhot - and I carried a laminated photo of him in my wallet and said he was my boyfriend. But no one believed me.": "Eliza",
  "'Thunderbolts' I was mostly attracted to because I really wanted to write Punisher and Elektra and Deadpool, who are characters I have always really enjoyed. But the funny thing is that over time, I came to really like Red Leader; he became one of my favorite guys in the book. Sometimes characters surprise you.": "Charles",
  "And remember, it's also very funny, because side by side with grief lies joy.": "Fran",
  "If you have a secret, people will sit a little bit closer.": "Rob",
  "Communism is like one big phone company.": "Lenny",
  "I remember nearly having a fit of the giggles during the reading because dear Daniel was SO respectful and serious and I was finding the whole situation funny because I was speaking to his profile.": "Madeleine",
  "It's funny, after a while, you get tired of having to fight someone because they don't like the way you look.": "Chris",
  "I like to make jokes I consider myself a funny person. I just think making jokes about people who are in a situation beyond their control is not funny to them or their families.": "Maria",
  "And at the time, it is funny how you can look at something and say, for example with my shoulder injury, when it first happened I said this is the worst thing that could happen to me. Why me, why now? Now I look back and say it was probably the best thing that happened to me.": "Drew",
  "What was really funny is that as I got older all those guys who called me a sissy in junior high school wanted me to be their best friend because they wanted to meet all the girls that I knew in figure skating.": "Scott",
  "Usually, if I think something is really funny, I'm not gonna test it. I'll just test it when I'm onstage.": "Donald",
  "It's so funny because I listen to songs that I recorded that I didn't really know anything about at the time. Later on I'm starting to feel the songs. Sing them first, feel them later.": "Tanya",
  "Everybody's funny if you love them.": "Anna",
  "I like the hot-cold, the sugar-salt, being able to play over-the-top and dramatic things - in the same film. Just as in my life, I can be very funny and at other times almost extinguished.": "Jean",
  "Comedians don't laugh. They're too busy analyzing why it's funny or not.": "James",
  "Whenever I'm in the U.K., people say I have an American accent. Which is, obviously, funny.": "Zedd",
  "It's funny to think that when you get done with an acting job, you're considered unemployed. There are definitely times when those checks don't last forever. I went to college at a private school, and I racked up quite a bit of debt. I was very slow to pay them back.": "Rami",
  "Snoop Dogg is hilarious. T.I. is really funny. Who else? 50 Cent is hilarious. Jay-Z is funny. I've met him, but he's funny in interviews. He was funny when I saw him, too. Ludacris is funny. Everybody is. Rappers are funny, a lot of them.": "Jay",
  "I like to tell kids that I started thinking about stories when I first started reading stuff like Dr. Seuss and 'Go, Dog. Go!,' thinking, 'Oh yeah, that's funny. I'd like to do that.' And then writing throughout school, but at the same time I was studying pre-med stuff, because my mom told me I should be a doctor.": "Jon",
  "The way taxes are, you might as well marry for love.": "Joe",
  "I really love showing up at work at 10 A.M., trying to make it funny until 3 P.M., and then going home. It's like comedy bankers' hours.": "Chris",
  "I live in a wonderful world of make-believe. A world of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire. A world of Winnie the Pooh and Edward Bear. Things like that. Wonderful things. Funny things.": "Eileen",
  "What does being a woman today mean? Is there a right way of doing it? Is there a wrong way of doing it? Different kinds of women, female friendships: It's all pretty funny, and worth making fun of.": "Elizabeth",
  "Whoever is my relative, I will not be nice to them.": "George",
  "It's a funny business. I kind of compare it to baseball. I'm always looking for a home run.": "Billy",
  "For sheer sexiness, a man must be beautiful. Funny. yes. Clever, no.": "Jilly",
  "I'd so much rather people think I was funny than pretty.": "Kristen",
  "The heroines in 'That's What She Said' are flawed, messy, damaged, hilarious and culpable and not really concerned about being acceptable to the audience in any traditional sense, which for me is what makes them all the more gorgeous. And the fearless truth of that is what makes it funny.": "Carrie",
  "It's really irritating. Even people who like my work sometimes come up to me and say, 'I usually don't like female comedians, but your material is great!' It makes the job prospect more daunting. Funny is funny, you know?": "Chelsea",
  "Someone told me that when they go to Vermont, they feel like they're home. I'm that way at Saks.": "Caroline",
  "It's funny because I remember when I came to the U.S. with 'Swimming Pool,' the movie did well, and it was great box office for a French movie, but I remember I was a bit upset because all people talked to me about was the nudity.": "Ludivine",
  "But I believe that there are marriages where you can have your pool table and she can have her scrapbooking room or garden or whatever it is. But when everyone has what they want, it's not funny. There's no conflict.": "Brad",
  "I own and operate a ferocious ego.": "Bill",
  "I read a funny story about how the Republicans freed the slaves. The Republicans are the ones who created slavery by law in the 1600's. Abraham Lincoln freed the slaves and he was not a Republican.": "Marion",
  "Until you walk a mile in another man's moccasins you can't imagine the smell.": "Robert",

  "When somebody listens and laughs, you're always in better shape than when you're with those folks who just kind of look at you when you say something funny. You wonder if they're looking at you because they're mad that they didn't say it or something. It's hard to handle that.": "Jason",
  "I think it's great when dramatic actors do lighter, funny roles.": "Noureen",

This is their world and it's all part of being in the country.' I realized, 'Oh my God, my girls are really city girls.'": "Anna",
  "Unfortunately, sometimes the fans forget who puts the money and passion into the club. It's funny, but when you win, it's the coach and the players who are responsible, but when you lose, it's the owner's fault; but that's football.": "Andrea",

  "Imagination is a very potent thing, and in the uneducated often usurps the place of genuine experience.": "H.",

  "There's this long history of colonialism and the colonial gaze when applied to matters related to China. So a lot of conceptions about China in literary representations in the West are things you can't even fight against because they've been there so long that they've become part of the Western imagination of China.": "Ken",
  "Growing up in a suburban home, the world seems so massive to you. It seems like cities are so big and so far away, and there's so much in them. So your imagination runs wild, instead of when you are born in the middle of Manhattan, you'd know, like, that this is the biggest city.": "Shawn",
  "As long as I was well fed, I was a very, very nice child. I just used my imagination and played with Barbies. I was pretty easy.": "Sabrina",
  "The greatest gift you have been given is the gift of your imagination - what do you dream of wanting to do?": "Amanda",
  "A lot of these liberal churches that harbor illegal immigrants who are criminals say they are following the example of Jesus. They are following the Jesus of their imagination rather than the Jesus of the Bible.": "Robert",
  "Obviously the facts are never just coming at you but are incorporated by an imagination that is formed by your previous experience. Memories of the past are not memories of facts but memories of your imaginings of the facts.": "Philip",
  "Writing is more about imagination than anything else. I fell in love with words. I fell in love with storytelling.": "Pat",
  "Gender fluidity is not really feeling like you're at one end of the spectrum or the other. For the most part, I definitely don't identify as any gender. I'm not a guy; I don't really feel like a woman, but obviously I was born one. So, I'm somewhere in the middle, which - in my perfect imagination - is like having the best of both sexes.": "Ruby",
  "Growing up, I had a very vivid imagination and Leonardo was like my best imaginary friend that I spoke to. When things were tough, or I was scared in an unsafe environment, I always imagined that the Ninja Turtles would come to the rescue.": "Ruby",
  "There are no shortcuts in life - only those we imagine.": "Frank",
  "Ideas come from ordinary, everyday life. And from imagination. And from feelings. And from memories. Memories of dust in my sneakers and humming whitewalls down a hill called Monkey.": "Jerry",
  "To treat your facts with imagination is one thing, to imagine your facts is another.": "John",
  "A man at work, making something which he feels will exist because he is working at it and wills it, is exercising the energies of his mind and soul as well as of his body. Memory and imagination help him as he works.": "William",
  "All of imagination - everything that we think, we feel, we sense - comes through the human brain. And once we create new patterns in this brain, once we shape the brain in a new way, it never returns to its original shape.": "Jay",
  "The imagination of our children is blunted on television, and their thinking is done for them.": "Stanley",
  "It may seem unfashionable to say so, but historians should seize the imagination as well as the intellect. History is, in a sense, a story, a narrative of adventure and of vision, of character and of incident. It is also a portrait of the great general drama of the human spirit.": "Peter",
  "When I was a young person I went to the university and I learned a rational language, to think with the left side of the brain. But in the right side of the brain you have intuition and imagination. Words are not the truth; they indicate the way to go, but you need to go alone, in silence. Symbols have a language that kills the words.": "Alejandro",
  "I do think imagination is enormously valuable, and that children should be encouraged in their imagination. That's very true.": "Richard",
  "I suppose I'm proudest of my novels for what's imagined in them. I think the world of my imagination is a richer and more interesting place than my personal biography.": "John",
  "Self-awareness is not the same thing as self-approval, any more than imagination is the same thing as day-dreaming.": "Francis",
  "A man, to carry on a successful business, must have imagination. He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing. A man can cultivate this faculty only by an appreciation of the finer things in life.": "Charles",
  "People are powerfully moved by imagination, belief, and knowledge. They can consider the past and future. They can make changes in their behavior out of reason in a way that animals can't do.": "Gretchen",
  "You have to really stretch your imagination to infer what the intrinsic value of Bitcoin is. I haven't been able to do it. Maybe somebody else can.": "Alan",
  "I don't think that people should wear dresses two sizes too small. I just think that sexiness is better left to the imagination. It's just more tasteful.": "Rachel",
  "Cooking with kids is not just about ingredients, recipes, and cooking. It's about harnessing imagination, empowerment, and creativity.": "Guy",

  "Cowardice... is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend functioning of the imagination.": "Ernest",
  "All the works of man have their origin in creative fantasy. What right have we then to depreciate imagination.": "Carl",
  "Don't stay at the job for safe salary increases over time. That will never get you where you want - freedom from financial worry. Only free time, imagination, creativity, and an ability to disappear will help you deliver value that nobody ever delivered before in the history of mankind.": "James",

  "Abstraction is one of the greatest visionary tools ever invented by human beings to imagine, decipher, and depict the world.": "Jerry",
  "Sometimes a technology is so awe-inspiring that the imagination runs away with it - often far, far away from reality. Robots are like that. A lot of big and ultimately unfulfilled promises were made in robotics early on, based on preliminary successes.": "Daniel",
  "I have a good imagination. Look, I know what it feels like to have a broken heart. I know what it feels like to feel something for somebody. I'm just too weird to be in a relationship.": "Diane",
  "The World Series is played in my doubtless too-nostalgic imagination in some kind of autumn afternoon light, and seeing it exclusively in the bitter chill of midnight breaks the spell of even the best of games.": "Adam",
  "I think growing up on a farm in a certain amount of isolation, with not a lot of friends nearby, makes you entertain yourself and kind of grows your imagination - being alone is quite good for all that. You make up stories, talk to the animals, let them be an audience, a bunch of cows.": "Kristen",
  "I am enough of an artist to draw freely upon my imagination.": "Albert",
  "Imagination, the supreme delight of the immortal and the immature, should be limited. In order to enjoy life, we should not enjoy it too much.": "Vladimir",
  "The imagination is the spur of delights... all depends upon it, it is the mainspring of everything; now, is it not by means of the imagination one knows joy? Is it not of the imagination that the sharpest pleasures arise?": "Marquis",
  "People can die of mere imagination.": "Geoffrey",
  "A man, to be greatly good, must imagine intensely and comprehensively; he must put himself in the place of another and of many others; the pains and pleasures of his species must become his own.": "Percy",

  "I'm a dreamer with lots of energy and a vivid imagination. That's the recipe for becoming an entertainer.": "Goldie",
  "Hypnosis is about shutting down the conscious mind and re-igniting the unconscious and the imagination, so while I give instructions to them under hypnosis, the contestants might interpret those instructions in all kinds of ways.": "Keith",
  "Works of imagination should be written in very plain language the more purely imaginative they are the more necessary it is to be plain.": "Samuel",
  "We are the miracle of force and matter making itself over into imagination and will. Incredible. The Life Force experimenting with forms. You for one. Me for another. The Universe has shouted itself alive. We are one of the shouts.": "Ray",
  "I don't necessarily start with the beginning of the book. I just start with the part of the story that's most vivid in my imagination and work forward and backward from there.": "Beverly",
  "I feel like I'm a much better person when I'm developing my imagination and my innocence and my vulnerability. I like that version of me better than the version where I'm just working on my analytical mind.": "Brit",
  "Mostly, I straddle reality and the imagination. My reality needs imagination like a bulb needs a socket. My imagination needs reality like a blind man needs a cane.": "Tom",
  "Living in a small town, one of the keys to survival was your imagination.": "Nick",
  "Who cares about the men who steered your breakfast cereal through winter storms? How ironic that the more ships have grown in size and consequence, the less space they take up in our imagination.": "Rose",
  "Men often take their imagination for their heart and they believe they are converted as soon as they think of being converted.": "Blaise",
  "It would be too frightening for me to consider myself a role model. But I like the idea of not being afraid of letting your imagination rule you, to feel the freedom of expression, to let creativity be your overwhelming drive rather than other things.": "Florence",
  "When I got large enough to go to work, while employed I was reflecting on many things that would present themselves to my imagination; and whenever an opportunity occurred of looking at a book, when the school-children were getting their lessons, I would find many things that the fertility of my own imagination had depicted to me before.": "Nat",
  "America is a poem in our eyes; its ample geography dazzles the imagination, and it will not wait long for metres.": "Ralph",
  "One can live in the shadow of an idea without grasping it.": "Elizabeth",
  "A man may imagine things that are false, but he can only understand things that are true, for if the things be false, the apprehension of them is not understanding.": "Isaac",
  "I still find it quite easy to find my way into a child's imagination. We're all Peter Pan ourselves in some respects. Everybody should keep some grip on childhood, even as a grownup.": "Tim",

  "One longs for a director with a sense of imagination.": "Alan",
  "The openness of rural Nebraska certainly influenced me. That openness, in a way, fosters the imagination. But growing up, Lincoln wasn't a small town. It was a college town. It had record stores and was a liberal place.": "Matthew",
  "It would be a bitter cosmic joke if we destroy ourselves due to atrophy of the imagination.": "Martha",
  "I used my imagination to make the grass whatever color I wanted it to be.": "Whoopi",
  "The woman who appeals to a man's vanity may stimulate him, the woman who appeals to his heart may attract him, but it is the woman who appeals to his imagination who gets him.": "Helen",

  "What's in front of you is a whole world of experiences beyond your imagination. Put yourself, and your growth and development, first.": "Phylicia",
  "I'm always easily frightened and I hate being scared. I've never been able to go on the haunted house rides at carnivals of anything like that my imagination just takes over! ": "Caity",
  "In a rehearsal room, your real resource as an actor aren't the things around you; your resources are your imagination and your director and the other actors. In those close quarters, your imagination and your skills are what you turn to.": "Stephen",
  "The one thing emphasized in any creative writing course is 'write what you know,' and that automatically drives a wooden stake through the heart of imagination. If they really understood the mysterious process of creating fiction, they would say, 'You can write about anything you can imagine.'": "Tom",
  "I'm attracted to stories that excite my imagination, stories that, as I'm reading the script, I feel it, I can see it, I can hear the characters. I'm attracted to characters that are real, that tap into something inside me that I haven't explored yet.": "Tatiana",
  "To create a new standard, it takes something that's not just a little bit different; it takes something that's really new and really captures people's imagination, and the Macintosh, of all the machines I've ever seen, is the only one that meets that standard.": "Bill",
  "If you were a successful upper-middle-class Negro girl in the 1950s and '60s, you were, in practice and imagination, a white Protestant upper middle-class girl. Young, good-looking white women were the most desirable creatures in the world. It was hard not to want to imitate them; it was highly toxic, too, as we would learn.": "Margo",
  "I was always extremely creative. I was very artistic and never strong with numbers or science. I wanted to be an artist or a fashion designer. I wanted to be something that allowed for a lot of imagination.": "Whitney",
  "My country has contrived for me the most insignificant office that ever the invention of man contrived or his imagination conceived.": "John",
  "The face of nature and civilization in this our country is to a certain point a very sufficient literary field. But it will yield its secrets only to a really grasping imagination. To write well and worthily of American things one need even more than elsewhere to be a master.": "Henry",
  "The source and center of all man's creative power... is his power of making images, or the power of imagination.": "Robert",
  "The innovative process is a fragile one, dependent on a complex, often messy interplay of imagination, competition, and exchange. Curbing new ideas hurts not only individual creators but the audience for which they create and the posterity that inherits their legacy.": "Virginia",
  "Without imagination we can go nowhere. And imagination is not restricted to the arts. Every scientist I have met who has been a success has had to imagine.": "Rita",

  "Vulgarity begins when imagination succumbs to the explicit.": "Doris",

  "Some stories are true that never happened.": "Elie",
  "Personally, I would sooner have written Alice in Wonderland than the whole Encyclopedia Britannica.": "Stephen",
  "The human mind evolved always in the company of the human body, and of the animal body before it was human. The intricate connections of mind and body must exceed our imagination, as from our point of view we are peculiarly prevented from observing them.": "John",
  "I've spent my life butting my head against other people's lack of imagination.": "Nick",
  "Here is everything which can lay hold of the eye, ear and imagination - everything which can charm and bewitch the simple and ignorant. I wonder how Luther ever broke the spell.": "John",

  "One of the virtues of being very young is that you don't let the facts get in the way of your imagination.": "Sam",
  "Poetry is that art which selects and arranges the symbols of thought in such a manner as to excite the imagination the most powerfully and delightfully.": "William",
  "You expect far too much of a first sentence. Think of it as analogous to a good country breakfast: what we want is something simple, but nourishing to the imagination.": "Larry",
  "My main point here is that if you are the child of God and God is a part of you, the in your imagination God suppose to look like you. And when you accept a picture of the deity assigned to you by another people, you become the spiritual prisoners of that other people.": "John",
  "To put down an ideogram of a table so that people will recognize it as a table is not the work of a painter, but to sense it for a moment as a magic carpet with a leg hanging down at each corner is the beginning of a painter's imagination.": "Frank",
  "Dr. Einstein was not successful in school, but he found something in the air from his own imagination and his own brain power, and look what he did.": "Eartha",
  "I always believe it's better to have 30 imaginations working on a project, rather than one imagination telling the other 29 what to do.": "Trevor",

  "Writing poetry is the hard manual labor of the imagination.": "Ishmael",
  "But I'm never gonna get to a point in my life where what it costs to shoot a movie is going to determine what it is. The limits of my imagination is the only thing that's gonna stop me.": "Abel",
  "I've always felt that what I have going for me is not my imagination, because everyone has an imagination. What I have is a relentlessly controlled imagination. What looks like wild invention is actually quite carefully calculated.": "Terry",
  "I was raised not to be afraid to show emotion or imagination.": "Javier",
  "Many memory techniques involve creating unforgettable imagery, in your mind's eye. That's an act of imagination. Creating really weird imagery really quickly was the most fun part of my training to compete in the U.S. Memory Competition.": "Joshua",
  "With me, writing is 60% imagination, 30% people you know and 10% you don't know where it comes from.": "Terrence",
  "I grew up believing my sister was from the planet Neptune and had been sent down to Earth to kill me. I believed this because my sister Emily convinced me of it when I was a toddler. I think she'd seen Invasion of the Body Snatchers and her imagination ran away with her. There's a part of me that still believes it.": "Zooey",
  "Students are rewarded for memorization, not imagination or resourcefulness.": "Sugata",
  "Games are the way we keep romance alive. They're based in human hardwiring. Playing hard-to-get or leaving a little to the imagination allows the woman to be wooed and appreciated and the man to be challenged and intrigued.": "Helen",
  "It is literature which for me opened the mysterious and decisive doors of imagination and understanding. To see the way others see. To think the way others think. And above all, to feel.": "Salman",
  "Nature's imagination is so boundless compared to our own meager human imagination.": "James",
  "Your heart will be shattered by sorrow if you force it to live in tomorrow's ephemeral imagination - world instead of in today's eternal reality - now.": "Sri",
  "I always have this imagination, something I want to use. I don't understand the idea of leisure time.": "Cher",
  "Some music comes from a real place; some music comes from your imagination. It's difficult to find out what's real and what's not, especially with the gangster stuff.": "Ice",
  "I've got an overactive brain. I enjoy work, I enjoy life, and I'm not good at relaxing. I've also never slept very much due to this overactive imagination and my brain constantly thinking.": "Rick",
  "Taking a comic strip character is very hard to write. Because comics are meant to work in one page, to work in frames with minimalistic dialogue. And a lot of it is left to the imagination of the reader. To do that in film, you've got to be a little more explanatory. And that requires a good screenplay and good dialogue.": "Ridley",
  "The fictive structure, my work, my imagination, my books are about the details, the huge construction about culture, Islamic culture or modern Turkey. They're all intertwined.": "Orhan",
  "People seem to have trouble with the imagination. They can't believe that you can just pull things out of your brain like that.": "Edward",
  "Using my imagination and creativity is exciting to me.": "Jan",
  "I sometimes think that so much of our life takes place inside our heads - in memory or imagination or interpretation or speculation - that if I really want to change my life, I might best begin by changing my mind.": "Pico",
  "Bad people are, from the point of view of art, fascinating studies. They represent colour, variety and strangeness. Good people exasperate one's reason; bad people stir one's imagination.": "Oscar",
  "I get ideas from my own personal experiences, from my imagination, and from my research and from old stories.": "Mary",
  "Remember that your imagination is yours and yours alone. You have the inborn capacity to use it in any way that you choose. No one else is responsible for your imagination. Anything placed in your imagination and held there ultimately becomes your reality.": "Wayne",
  "Although technology has enhanced our lives in many ways, it has also ensured the erosion of imagination.": "Alexandra",
  "I get irritated with the world. I get irritated with politicians. I get very irritated with governments and with corporations, but in terms of imagination - my imagination is always fertile. I'm either thinking of my own things or constantly engaged by the things that other people do.": "Patti",
  "Walt Disney had a nuclear imagination before the advent of nuclear, some comprehension of apocalypse and rapture deep in his genes.": "Steve",
  "The appeal of the spectrally macabre is generally narrow because it demands from the reader a certain degree of imagination and a capacity for detachment from everyday life.": "H.",
  "I think acting is a work of imagination.": "Elodie",
  "The writer's goal is to try to make it frightening without describing it too much, and yet not making it so grey that you don't know what's going on... Your imagination can imagine all sorts of really horrible things, and if you're able to prolong that feeling, then you've succeeded.": "Arthur",
  "I always struggle with making the technical aspects of the plot fit with the story that's unfolding in my imagination.": "Deborah",
  "People are always saying it's the end of the Gutenberg era. More to the point, it's a return to an oral era. The Gutenberg galaxy was about the written word. At its best, the digital era is part of the rediscovery of the oral. At its worst, it's a Kafkaesque victory of the bureaucratic over the imagination.": "John",
  "Children depend mightily on animals for comfort, inspiration, imagination, and art. And parents have long recognized this.": "Lydia",
  "The public has an appetite for anything about imagination - anything that is as far away from reality as is creatively possible.": "Steven",
  "What really fascinates me is this need that is so strong now that if you read a work of the imagination you instantly have to say, 'Oh, what this really is is so-and-so,' reducing it to a simple formula.": "Doris",
  "Teachers need to feel they are trusted. They must be allowed some leeway to use their imagination; otherwise, teaching loses all sense of wonder and excitement.": "Alan",
  "'Harry Potter' really harnessed the imagination of so many young-adult minds, and it's the same with the 'Divergent' series.": "Kate",
  "The imagination imitates. It is the critical spirit that creates.": "Oscar",
  "You have to come in and be that character when you walk into the room. That's what one of my first acting teachers taught me. You know, don't go in there being Jennifer and then expect to flip and change, because they're not going to have that imagination.": "Jennifer",
  "Death? Why this fuss about death? Use your imagination, try to visualize a world without death! Death is the essential condition of life, not an evil.": "Charlotte",
  "Today the function of the artist is to bring imagination to science and science to imagination, where they meet, in the myth.": "Cyril",
  "If we find it hard to believe that winning millions might not be so lucky after all, we just don't have a good enough imagination. If I fantasise about winning the lottery, it doesn't take long before all sorts of worrisome potential consequences occur to me.": "Julian",
  "My hope is that this life is not all there is. This life is like preparation for what is coming next, and what is coming next is something so glorious that the Bible says minds can't conceive it, eye has never seen, your imagination could never even enter into all that God is preparing for those who love him.": "Anne",
  "I just have a relationship with my imagination. It's like my friend, almost.": "Steven",
  "I don't feel there's any reason to apologise for having a wicked imagination. I think it's important as a maker of fantasy and of horror.": "Clive",

  "Never, and I mean never, allow anyone else's ideas of who you can or can't become sully your dream or pollute your imagination. This is your territory, and a 'Keep Out' sign is a great thing to erect at all entrances to your imagination.": "Wayne",
  "I don't believe my house was haunted. I think I had an overactive imagination, and I was so convinced that those around me became convinced, too.": "Ryan",
  "Without this playing with fantasy no creative work has ever yet come to birth. The debt we owe to the play of the imagination is incalculable.": "Carl",
  "I had an incredibly full life with my imagination: I used to have all sorts of trolls and things; I had a wonderful world around my toys and invented people. I don't mean I had imaginary friends; I just had this big imagination thing going on. I didn't need any imaginary friends, because I had so much other stuff going on.": "Kate",
  "I feel like my imagination was crafted by Tolkien. He seemed to tap into that childhood intrigue of secret doors and hidden worlds.": "Richard",
  "In many a piece of music, it's the pause or the rest that gives the piece its beauty and its shape. And I know I, as a writer, will often try to include a lot of empty space on the page so that the reader can complete my thoughts and sentences and so that her imagination has room to breathe.": "Pico",
  "I didn't like Barbie dolls, so I used to have this overactive imagination, and I used to pretend to be all these different things. My weird childhood fetishes seem to have come to life now as an actor.": "Sonam",
  "People write memoirs because they lack the imagination to make things up.": "Tom",
  "In my wildest imagination, I never thought that the fifth of six children born to Helen and Buddy Watts - in a poor black neighborhood, in the poor rural community of Eufaula, Oklahoma - would someday be called Congressman.": "J.",
  "Nonfiction is both easier and harder to write than fiction. It's easier because the facts are already laid out before you, and there is already a narrative arc. What makes it harder is that you are not free to use your imagination and creativity to fill in any missing gaps within the story.": "Amy",
  "The novel and the film of 'The Color Purple' are both works of the imagination that make claim to historical truth.": "Darryl",
  "It's through the small things that we develop our moral imagination, so that we can understand the sufferings of others.": "Alexander",

  "It is usually the imagination that is wounded first, rather than the heart; it being much more sensitive.": "Henry",
  "I feel very lucky to make a living from my imagination I'm very grateful for that. I like that what I do is create. I'm feeling very lucky to have had the career I had. It's gone much longer and bigger than I ever thought it would be.": "Steven",
  "People may think I'm trying something new by telling stories, but they're just jokes connected to give the illusion of stories. But really, I just continue using my imagination and creating. That's what I do.": "Steven",

  "Few people have the imagination for reality.": "Johann",
  "Were it not for imagination a man would be as happy in arms of a chambermaid as of a duchess.": "Samuel",
  "Experience teaches that when the will and imagination are in conflict, the imagination usually wins. What we imagine may defeat our reason and make us slaves to what we taste, see, hear, smell, and feel in the mind's eye. The body is indeed the servant of the mind.": "Joseph",

  "I can't satisfy myself with just trying to tie all of my imagination into music, especially when music is not appreciated as an art form as much as it used to be.": "Marilyn",
  "Mars has long exerted a pull on the human imagination. The erratically moving red star in the sky was seen as sinister or violent by the ancients: The Greeks identified it with Ares, the god of war; the Babylonians named it after Nergal, god of the underworld. To the ancient Chinese, it was Ying-huo, the fire planet.": "John",
  "Whoever has once been truly unsettled by a work of the imagination will never give loyalty to a single idea, belief system, religious faith or party.": "Howard",
  "Not everyone is fortunate enough to earn their living playing. But what draws people to art and artists is a desire to enjoy the propinquity of play. For it is the very freedom of the imagination. And what else were we born to do, but imagine freely?": "Howard",
  "While the sciences are hugely important, let us not leave behind a child's imagination.": "Kevin",
  "I always felt that what is scary is actually hearing someone tell you what they think they see. That sense of invisibility makes things a lot scarier, since your imagination tends to fill in the gaps.": "James",
  "We can conceive of eternity because we cannot conceive of a cessation of time. We can conceive of infinite space because we cannot conceive of so much matter that our imagination will not stand upon the farthest star and see infinite space beyond.": "Robert",
  "My problem is that my imagination won't turn off. I wake up so excited I can't eat breakfast. I've never run out of energy. It's not like OPEC oil I don't worry about a premium going on my energy. It's just always been there. I got it from my mom. ": "Steven",

  "I've always had a slightly overactive imagination.": "Daniel",
  "Many scientists think that philosophy has no place, so for me it's a sad time because the role of reflection, contemplation, meditation, self inquiry, insight, intuition, imagination, creativity, free will, is in a way not given any importance, which is the domain of philosophers.": "Deepak",
  "We're living in a time when the world has suddenly discovered India because it's run out of raw material for its imagination. The raw materials for imagination are inexhaustible here.": "Deepak",
  "Being on a trapeze is like dreaming. I feel totally outside of myself when I'm flying. You know, designing shoes, my imagination is flying in my drawings.": "Christian",

  "I know there's been a lot that's been said about animated voice work, as though it's 'you can do this in your jeans and there's no camera and no pressure there. It's no big deal. It's easy.' The truth is, it's really a great test: how deep is your ability is to access your imagination?": "Nicolas",
  "Science fiction is a way that I can go into the abstract, go into the imagination, and audiences are still willing to go along for the ride.": "Nicolas",
  "Often you hear stories about never working with children. I disagree because children still have that residual magical thinking. They haven't had their imagination knocked out of them by turning into adults and life experiences.": "Nicolas",

  "Imagination is a poor matter when it has to part company with understanding.": "Thomas",
  "Imagination is a pretty powerful thing, and when you're in the moment and you're riding a train and you're asked to look scared, I don't know, it just kind of works out. And in those moments where you're actually doing some of the stunts, then it's not so hard at all, because there's an actual fear there.": "Chris",
  "I came from a childhood where I spent a lot of time alone and a lot of time just living with my imagination, and a certain amount of the adult world was kind of alienating.": "Chris",
  "There's a particular sensitivity required to be an artist, and a certain vulnerability, perhaps, and also, somewhere between, you're in your body a lot, too. It's much more physical than one would imagine because I think it's the body where the imagination lives somehow. I do feel the imagination isn't just in the brain up there.": "Michael",
  "I love theatrics and have a huge imagination: Why would I want to sit onstage and sing a bunch of ballads back-to-back?": "Christina",
  "No film has captivated my imagination more than 'King Kong.' I'm making movies today because I saw this film when I was 9 years old.": "Peter",
  "'The Lord of the Rings,' published in the mid-1950s, was intended as a prehistory to our own world. It was perceived by Tolkien to be a small but significant episode in a vast alternate mythology constructed entirely out of his own imagination.": "Peter",
  "Because of my faith and my imagination, I was able to enjoy my childhood, even though it was tough.": "Donna",
  "I have a huge, active imagination, and I think I'm really scared of being alone; because if I'm left to my own devices, I'll just turn into a madwoman.": "Claire",

  "There is a boundary to men's passions when they act from feelings but none when they are under the influence of imagination.": "Edmund",
  "But if I have a lot of imagination, I could tell myself whatever I wanted, you know. I handle myself quite well. I'm kind of fascist with myself, you know. There's no discussion. There is an order. You follow it.": "Karl",
  "I do a lot of curiosity buying; I buy it if I like the album cover, I buy it if I like the name of the band, anything that sparks my imagination.": "Bruce",
  "I suspect that even most conservatives would prefer to live in the kind of world conjured up in the liberals' imagination rather than in the kind of world we are in fact stuck with.": "Thomas",
  "Obviously the imagination is fueled by emotions beyond the control of the conscious mind.": "Joyce",

  "My imagination is so far out there already. People couldn't imagine what goes on in my brain.": "Missy",
  "The theater itself is a lie. Its deaths are mere special effects. Its tales never happened. Even the histories are distorted for dramatic effect. The theater is unnatural, a place of imagination. But the theater tells the audience something true: that the world requires judgments.": "Virginia",
  "'A Princess of Mars' may not have exerted the same colossal pull that Tarzan had on the global imagination, but its influence on generations of readers cannot be underestimated.": "Junot",
  "Speculators get a bad rap. In the popular imagination they're greedy, heedless, and amoral, adept at price manipulations and dirty tricks. In reality, they often play a key role in making markets run smoothly.": "James",
  "There's basically an element of fiction in everything you remember. Imagination and memory are almost the same brain processes. When I write fiction, I know that I'm using a bunch of lies that I've made up to create some form of truth. When I write a memoir, I'm using true elements to create something that will always be somehow fictionalized.": "Isabel",
  "A nickname is the heaviest stone that the devil can throw at a man. It is a bugbear to the imagination, and, though we do not believe in it, it still haunts our apprehensions.": "William",
  "The degree in which a poet's imagination dominates reality is, in the end, the exact measure of his importance and dignity.": "George",
  "My proudest moment was probably when my oldest boy finished law school and went on to become an FBI agent. It was just beyond my imagination that - with my background - my own son would become an FBI agent.": "Frank",
  "I've proven I'm courageous. I'm gutsier than anybody; I've got a better imagination than anybody; I'm essentially more creative than any other actor I know, and I've proven I take risks. I don't think I need to prove anything to myself any more.": "Michael",
  "To make extra money, my parents would sell eggs and chickens. I was very little. I remember a chicken's head being chopped off with the chicken running around. I wasn't sure if my imagination was running away with me or if it really happened. It really happened.": "Michael",
  "Anything I did with the WWE was not therapeutic by any stretch of the imagination. The reality is that nobody's going to tell you that, because they have an umbilical cord hooked to Vince McMahon. I, ladies and gentlemen, do not.": "Bill",
  "The new age of terrorism isn't on the battlefield: it's in your own backyard. Whether it's at a concert in France or a restaurant in the United States, terrorism doesn't have to happen in a military installation by any stretch of the imagination.": "Bill",

  "I didn't choose Goldberg because I wanted to be the flagship for the Jewish movement, not by any stretch of the imagination. I chose Goldberg because no one else can own it.": "Bill",
  "It's what still excites me most about acting: letting your imagination go places it's never been before. There's nothing better than that.": "Robin",
  "Out with stereotypes, feminism proclaims. But stereotypes are the west's stunning sexual personae, the vehicles of art's assault against nature. The moment there is imagination, there is myth.": "Camille",
  "Ideas seem to come from everywhere - my life, everything I see, hear, and read, and most of all, from my imagination. I have a lot of imagination.": "Judy",
  "For some reason I can't explain, artist and musicians tend to look younger than our age. Being in music, you need this youthful sense of discovery and wonder for what you're doing and keep your imagination open. That's a youthful way of looking at life and I think that reflects in how you age.": "Joshua",
  "Edgy is fine - I'm not a prude by any stretch of the imagination - but what's wrong with a good ol' belly laugh? I miss that.": "Carol",
  "I want to liberate my imagination and my mind with every kind of movie. That is what I wanted to do all my life.": "Alejandro",
  "So often, science fiction helps to get young people interested in science. That's why I don't mind talking about science fiction. It has a real role to play: to seize the imagination.": "Michio",
  "I don't want to go on much longer, really. I think that would suggest a lack of imagination. A certain lack of dignity also.": "Morrissey",
  "Nobody would know it to look at me, but the movies I liked as a kid were musicals - 'All That Jazz,' 'Hair,' 'Fame,' 'Annie,' all that stuff - that's where my little youthful imagination was.": "Juliette",

  "It takes no imagination to live within your means.": "Francis",
  "I'm essentially the result of other people's imagination. And that's fine. Because of other people's imagination, I've played parts I would never have thought I could do. Still, I've never had a hankering or an ambition for any particular role.": "John",
  "Acting is an imaginative exercise. It would be odd if you didn't try to identify with the roles you play, but I think I can differentiate between where my imagination is leading me and where I actually am.": "John",
  "I would love to meet J.K. Rowling and tell her how much I admire her writing and am amazed by her imagination. I read every 'Harry Potter' book as it came out and looked forward to each new one. I am rereading them now with my kids and enjoying them every bit as much. She made me look at jelly beans in a whole new way.": "Sheryl",

  "A good comic explores the imagination, but it's always got to have those notes of truth running through it.": "Michael",

  "The faking of feelings is a sin against the imagination.": "Seamus",

  "I'm not such a fan of imagination. If you're alive to details, they oftentimes suggest a richer or deeper imaginative line than you would have imagined.": "Edmund",
  "I've developed a theory that there's an inverse relationship between money and imagination. That if you've got lots of imagination then you don't really need much money, and if you've got lots of money then you won't bother with much imagination.": "Alan",
  "Well, I'm not a method actress by any stretch of the imagination so the best thing that I can do is be as real as possible and find whatever commonality in that character that I can see myself.": "Rashida",
  "Reading a book, watching a movie, going to a play, it's transporting, and very, very exciting. And to be a part of that, creating things with your imagination, whoa.": "Steve",
  "Another side to me is this very sexual being. When I look back on my life, it's always been there. It's been there since I was 10 years old, having the imagination that I had.": "Janet",
  "I had a pretty sexual imagination for a kid.": "Janet",

  "What I really have in my head, my imagination, my understanding of music, I never really get that out.": "Wynton",
  "When television captured the popular imagination of the 1950s, a rash of movies satirized Hollywood while also mythologizing it.": "Steve",
  "The arts stimulate imagination. They provoke thought. And then, having done that, all sorts of other things happen.": "Melvyn",
  "As an actor, whether I'm playing Othello on stage or David Estes on 'Homeland,' that ability to give into your imagination is something that I enjoy.": "David",
  "Most of my interests in terms of writing are dark, so it's discordant how much I try to lock into the vibe of wherever I'm at. Inhabiting the life of the imagination is the nature of survival strategy - you build yourself little worlds to enjoy.": "John",
  "I tend to be really spacey, but I don't think it's because I'm unintelligent - it's just my imagination and a little bit of ADD.": "Jenny",
  "My imagination ran 24/7, and to me, every problem was a challenge to solve and new product to create. It wasn't until I started teaching that I realized that not everyone's head worked the same way.": "Steve",
  "As one of four daughters, I grew up with an imaginary brother - wondering what it would have been like if one of us had been a boy. There's no question that there was a phantom boy child in my imagination when I was young.": "Siri",
  "I don't want to discredit people's individuality, but I think people are pretty much the same. People are very similar. If you have a good enough imagination then you can feel things that you personally have never done before. That's acting.": "Kristen",
  "Los Angeles gives one the feeling of the future more strongly than any city I know of. A bad future, too, like something out of Fritz Lang's feeble imagination.": "Henry",
  "You know what's better than building things up in your imagination? Building things up in real life.": "Ryan",
  "A lot of things that I write about have happened to people around me, if not necessarily to me or in the organizations I've worked in. Having said that, it's fiction and has a lot to do with my imagination and creativity.": "Ravi",
  "When James Bond presses the watch and the car explodes, the writer doesn't go into the science of it. One should leave it to the leap of faith. I have tried to explain as much as possible, and what I can't, I have left it to people's imagination.": "Ravi",
  "You can't make money without selling something real. You can't make something real without first imagination manifesting itself in your head. You can't have imagination without surrendering yourself to an idea that you want to create something of value to other human beings.": "James",
  "Businessmen are not in business to lose customers, and schools do not exist to free their clients from the agencies of mass persuasion. School and media possess a productive monopoly upon the imagination of a child.": "Jonathan",

  "You know when you're a child and your imagination is limitless and you really believe in magic? I thought I had super powers.": "Michelle",

  "Many hedge fund managers have become billionaires perhaps this - plus their reputations as the smartest guys in the room - is why they have captured the investing public's imagination.": "Barry",
  "I had this desire to see the world. I couldn't see any of it, but I saw it in my imagination, and that's why I always read books, and I could go to Mars or Middle Earth or the Hyborian age.": "George",
  "To bolster his right flank and attract women voters, John McCain had cynically opted for a running mate who was, by any stretch of the imagination, unqualified for a position a heartbeat away from the presidency.": "Jay",
  "It's an imaginative thing we do; it's about immersing oneself in one's imagination. If you're a novelist, you do it with pen and paper. We do it with our bodies.": "Rupert",
  "I'm a big fan of imagination. I think it's the strongest tool we have, and there are some things that you just can't practice.": "Rupert",
  "I would love to do a western. I would love to play an explorer. That is always something that has really captured my imagination since I was a kid, like James Cook or Magellan or Earnest Shackleton.": "John",
  "I think that being read to every night is the reason why I was plowing through volume after volume of 'Nancy Drew' books all by myself by the time I reached the first grade. I loved stories. I loved the escape. I had a vivid imagination.": "Rachel",
  "The Jewish festival of freedom is the oldest continuously observed religious ritual in the world. Across the centuries, Passover has never lost its power to inspire the imagination of successive generations of Jews with its annually re-enacted drama of slavery and liberation.": "Jonathan",
  "In Ronald Reagan's chaotic childhood, the imagination was armor. There is nothing unusual about that; transcending the doubts, hesitations, and fears swirling around you by casting yourself internally as the hero of your own adventure story is a characteristic psychic defense mechanism of the Boy Who Disappears.": "Rick",
  "Companies like Google and Facebook may offer jobs allowing or requiring imagination and creativity, but the whole of Silicon Valley accounts for only 3 percent of national income and a smaller percentage of national employment.": "Edmund",
  "The map we made of the 3,000-year-old city of Tanis requires no imagination. It has buildings, streets, admin complexes, houses - clear as day.": "Sarah",
  "A-POC unleashes the freedom of imagination. It's for people who are curious, who have inner energy - the energy of life and living.": "Issey",
  "I would find myself laughing and wondering where these ideas came from. You can call it imagination, I suppose. But I was grateful for wherever they came from.": "Amy",
  "Everything that is new or uncommon raises a pleasure in the imagination, because it fills the soul with an agreeable surprise, gratifies its curiosity, and gives it an idea of which it was not before possessed.": "Joseph",
  "I know how fiction matters to me, because if I want to express myself, I have to make up a story. Some people call it imagination. To me, it's not imagination. It's just a way of watching.": "Haruki",
  "It's hard to see yourself as a princess because it involves a huge leap of the imagination and sort of requires you to believe you can be that, which is a scary, weird thing.": "Lily",
  "I'm a light sleeper. I've never been one of those people who can put their head down and suddenly everything disappears. Nighttime is the time I get most scared, anxious or worried. In those darker moments before waking or sleeping is when I feel most, I don't know, I can turn on myself, and my imagination can take me dark places.": "Florence",
  "To have frequent recourse to narrative betrays great want of imagination.": "Philip",
  "Novelists are not equipped to make a movie, in my opinion. They make their own movie when they write: they're casting, they're dressing the scene, they're working out where the energy of the scene is coming from and they're also relying tremendously on the creative imagination of the reader.": "John",
  "Like every novelist, I fantasise about film. Novelists are not equipped to make a movie, in my opinion.

  "Being an actor in movies is a lot about the power of your imagination and making the circumstance real to you so the audience will feel that it's real.": "Joel",
  "Wit is the appearance, the external flash of imagination. Thus its divinity, and the witty character of mysticism.": "Karl",
  "I seriously believed that my last hour was approaching, and yet, so strange is imagination, all I thought of was some childish hypothesis or other. In such circumstances, you do not choose your own thoughts. They overcome you.": "Jules",
  "I think more influential than Emily Dickinson or Coleridge or Wordsworth on my imagination were Warner Brothers, Merrie Melodies, and Loony Tunes cartoons.": "Billy",
  "Poetry can do a lot of things to people. I mean it can improve your imagination. It can take you to new places. It can give you this incredible form of verbal pleasure.": "Billy",
  "I'm trying to write poems that involve beginning at a known place, and ending up at a slightly different place. I'm trying to take a little journey from one place to another, and it's usually from a realistic place, to a place in the imagination.": "Billy",
  "It's not just that reporting gives you a bigger slice of life, gives - lends verisimilitude to what you are doing - it's that it feeds the imagination.": "Tom",
  "Our democracy, our constitutional framework is really a kind of software for harnessing the creativity and political imagination for all of our people. The American democratic system was an early political version of Napster.": "Al",

  "Use your imagination, and you'll see that even the most narrow, humdrum lives are infinite in scope if you examine them with enough care.": "Mark",
  "I'm nosey, and I have a great imagination. So it's not necessarily things I have to go through, but it's things people I know or my family is going through, and I hear about it, and I think, 'That sounds like a great song.'": "Becky",
  "The historical background is one of the easier aspects of writing a novel. Far more difficult is dreaming up the smaller, character-based scenes, scenes that rise entirely from one's own imagination.": "Ethan",

  "Regrettably, with '2001' having a title that had a year in it, science fiction essentially set itself up in the public's imagination as saying, 'Here's what you get if you wait to that year.' Well, we all waited till that year, and we didn't get anything at all like that.": "Robert",
  "You think in a different way when you don't have any money. The joy of poverty is that you use your imagination to come up with stuff.": "Amy",
  "It's a slight stretch of the imagination but most people are alike in most ways so I've never had any trouble identifying with the character that I'm playing.": "Jack",
  "John Kerry had a very vivid imagination as a young person. I mean, he actually did go and take his bicycle from Norway to go camp in Sherwood Forest to be around the ghost of Robin Hood.": "Douglas",
  "If there is a book that the script came from you have to read it, you have to see what you can get out of it: mood, back story and things that may not even be in the film. They kick off your imagination and broaden the character, I think.": "Miranda",
  "My parents thought it was nice to develop my imagination, but they never seriously thought that anything would ever come of it. They said that I couldn't be an actress because I would be taller than all my leading men, so I thought I would be a writer instead.": "Nicole",
  "When one paints an ideal, one does not need to limit one's imagination.": "Ellen",
  "There's no great mystery to acting. It's a very simple thing to do but you have to work hard at it. It's about asking questions and using your imagination.": "Eddie",
  "I don't think most books can be justifiably translated on screen. The film versions can't convey the right emotion, fuel your imagination or allow you to visualise every line the way books do.": "Sonam",
  "My mom would always read a book to me at night from when I was three. Now, I can't go to sleep without reading a book. At the same time, once I read, it's difficult for me to go to sleep, as I have an overactive imagination and I start thinking.": "Sonam",
  "I see all these people talking about acting as a great spiritual thing. It's not. There's no great mystery to acting. It's a very simple thing to do, but you have to work hard at it. It's about asking questions and using your imagination.": "Eddie",
  "I have a very strong imagination and have since I was a little kid. That is where a lot of my world comes from. It's like I'm off somewhere else. And I can have a problem in life because of that, because I'm always off in some other world thinking about something else. It's constant.": "James",

  "I take for granted that for the imaginative writer, the exercise of the imagination is part of the basic process of coping with reality, just as actors need to act all the time to make up for some deficiency in their sense of themselves.": "J.",
  "I felt the pressure of imagination against the doors of my mind was so great that they were going to burst.": "J.",
  "The study of history requires investigation, imagination, empathy, and respect. Reverence just doesn't enter into it.": "Jill",
  "I think Direct Cinema's trying to be insightful by looking at reality in a very close way while, in fact, much more is staged than we like to think. In cinema verite, it's about trying to make something invisible visible - the role of fantasy and imagination in everyday life.": "Joshua",
  "Syria may appear to be a small country, but it is just the type of entangled conflict that can lead to a world catastrophe. It does not take much imagination to see Syria as the Sarajevo of the 21st century, leading to world war.": "Ahmed",
  "Superheroes are best imagined in comic books. The union between the written word, the image, and then what your imagination has to do to connect those allows for so much.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "When I see Bruce Banner becoming the Hulk, it's only a picture. My imagination has to do some of the work there, to impute feeling and everything.

  "The imagination is part of the arsenal that actors draw from.": "Bryan",
  "'Castle' is a guy living in a fantasy world. He's in his imagination, writing these stories of murder.": "Nathan",
  "I think my printing to this day looks like the printing right out of a comic book. Actually, I always wanted to be in a comic book. I watched cartoons when I was a kid, too, and both comics and cartoons lit fire in my imagination. This realm holds a lot of interest for me, a lot of passion for me. So to be comic-ized, yeah, that's cool.": "Nathan",
  "There's the argument that you can relate to someone who's completely unrelatable. In the way that a director shows you his imagination on a film, then I get to show you my imagination in a big dumb character.": "Idris",
  "I have always thought that the place where you sleep or the place you share with your partner should be separate from the place where you write. The domestic rituals and details somehow kill the imagination. They kill the demon in me.": "Orhan",

  "It's amazing what you can do with an E in A-Level art, a twisted imagination and a chainsaw.": "Damien",
  "Visualization - it's been huge for me. Your mind doesn't know the difference between imagination and reality. You can't always practice perfectly - my fingers will play a little bit out of tune, or my dance moves might not be as sharp - but in my mind, I can practice perfectly.": "Lindsey",
  "The pleasures of the imagination are as it were only drawings and models which are played with by poor people who cannot afford the real thing.": "Georg",

  "I think imagination is a crazy thing, and that's what makes the world go around.": "Shahid",

  "There aren't any fences to the imagination, and so there shouldn't be any for books.": "Matt",
  "You always need that spark of imagination. Sometimes I'm midway through a book before it happens. However, I don't wait for the muse to descend, I sit down every day and I work when I'm not delivering lambs on the farm.": "Barbara",
  "We have to learn not to feel guilty about letting our imagination browse around, and you know, in writing fiction particularly. But I think, in any kind of writing, we have to learn to allow ourselves to approach it in a contemplative way.": "Sue",
  "I may have been sexy, but I was covered up total. There was something left to the imagination.": "Suzi",
  "Most of the songs I write are just very directly from my life. I don't have a big imagination. Whenever I tried to write from fantasy, it comes out sounding really fake.": "Rivers",
  "Everything you do on set is directly related to your imagination when you read the script for the first time.": "Ewan",
  "I'm not a passive person by any stretch of the imagination.": "Courteney",
  "Belief is nothing but a more vivid, lively, forcible, firm, steady conception of an object, than what the imagination alone is ever able to attain.": "David",
  "It's what you don't see that keeps you on the edge of your seat in any kind of film - leave it to the imagination of the viewer.": "Christopher",
  "Sometimes a character is really based on research that you do. Other times it's just based on your imagination or perhaps your conversation with the director. Or sometimes all of the above. It depends on the movie and character.": "Joaquin",
  "I guess I'm a very keen observer, and I'd like to think I have a good imagination.": "Eric",
  "I feel like 'Amelie' is very much an extension of me. She's a contemporary woman who sees the world through her imagination.": "Phillipa",
  "Everything is creative. It's all relative to me. No matter what, you've gotta use your imagination, use your senses.": "Action",
  "Theatre is about the collective imagination... Everything I use on-stage is driven by the subject matter and what you might call the text - but that text can be anything, from a fragment of movement or music to something you see on a TV.": "Simon",
  "I remember the fact that milk was delivered every day by a milkman. In summer, my mother would make what now seem in my middle-aged imagination the most delicious iced milkshakes.": "Simon",
  "I made a real specific decision when I came out of school and most artists were writing about home - if you were a woman, you were writing about being a woman - and I decided not to do that, write about what you know. That's not what I do. I went as far away from home as possible in terms of the development of my imagination.": "Anna",
  "Television contracts the imagination and radio expands it.": "Terry",
  "I think because I try to keep things as real as I can, or I try to start from a place of reality, I almost don't have the imagination to write a book that's not set where I am.": "Maria",
  "Some of us are interested in directors, but really the vast majority of us are interested in actors. You experience the films through the actors, so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.": "Danny",
  "You experience the films through the actors, so they're all locked into your imagination in some kind of layer of fantasy or hatred or wherever they settle into your imagination.": "Danny",
  "The aspect of kind of living in your imagination and creating a more romantic vision of the world than the reality that you're given - that's definitely something I can sort of relate to.": "Alden",
  "With any kind of sci-fi, the imagination continues, and the world exists, and you create that in your own mind, and it lives in you.": "Scott",
  "My mother always cultivated my imagination from the time I was very little.": "Alden",
  "If you use your imagination, you can look at any actress and see her nude... I hope to make you use your imagination.": "Hedy",
  "I never played Freddy as real. In the true bible of Wes Craven's outline for the films, Freddy only manifests himself in dreams. And a lot goes into a dream, not the least of which is imagination. So Freddy is secondhand information. Freddy is an urban legend that's been handed down to these teenagers over the years.": "Robert",
  "I started track and field when I was 12 and didn't get to an Olympic Games until I was nearly 23. By any stretch of the imagination that's a very long apprenticeship.": "Sebastian",
  "A man to carry on a successful business must have imagination. He must see things as in a vision, a dream of the whole thing.": "Charles",
  "I saw that publishing all over the world was deeply constrained by self-censorship, economics and political censorship, while the military-industrial complex was growing at a tremendous rate, and the amount of information that it was collecting about all of us vastly exceeded the public imagination.": "Julian",
  "Once you've got a child to the point that they've discovered books, they're safe. There's a world of the imagination that when they're hurt or upset, they can move into, and it is wonderful.": "John",
  "I love sci-fi because it leads in the imagination, and I always say it has the most intelligent fans in the world.": "Robert",
  "We didn't have all the distractions that young people have today. We didn't have these incredible computer games and social networks to engage with. I understand that. But once young readers do discover reading, when they discover a book which they fall in love with, it really unleashes something new in their imagination.": "Mark",
  "A reader's own imagination is a far more powerful form of CGI than anything any movie can provide because it's unique. In your own imagination, you can enter all sorts of worlds, and they are unique to you because no other reader will interpret a book the same way.": "Mark",
  "When France was the only reference for chefs to learn, you could go everywhere in the world, and they would copy dishes directly because they didn't have much expanded imagination or technique or knowledge.": "Daniel",
  "The human imagination... has great difficulty in living strictly within the confines of a materialist practice or philosophy. It dreams, like a dog in its basket, of hares in the open.": "John",
  "You get your heart stomped by the opposite sex, and you're hurting so badly that you write 'Sometimes When We Touch.' But then what happens when you've been married for 25 years? You can't rely on those emotional male-female roller coasters. You have to start using your imagination and the powers of empathy more.": "Dan",
  "The more ships have grown in size and consequence, the more their place in our imagination has shrunk.": "Rose",
  "Never forget that the truest luxury is imagination, and that being a writer gives you the leeway to exploit all of the imagination's curious intricacies, to be what you were, what you are, what you will be, and what everyone else is or was or will be, too.": "Andrew",
  "I have a very vivid imagination.": "Janice",
  "You have to imagine it possible before you can see something. You can have the evidence right in front of you, but if you can't imagine something that has never existed before, it's impossible.": "Rita",
  "Fools act on imagination without knowledge, pedants act on knowledge without imagination.": "Alfred",
  "I sometimes say that I don't make anything up - obviously that's not true. But I am uninterested in writers who say that everything comes out of the imagination. I would rather be in a room with someone who is telling the story of his life, which may be exaggerated and even have lies in it, but I want to hear the true story, essentially.": "James",
  "I have never been able to pay attention to anything for more than a few minutes - the stories in my head have always been so much more entertaining. Only books could pull me out of my own imagination, and then it was only to plunge me into someone else's.": "W.",
  "For someone who writes fiction, in order to activate the imagination and the unconscious, it's essential to be free.": "Manuel",
  "It was just very interesting to me that certain types of women inspire people's imagination, and all of them were very difficult women.": "Elizabeth",
  "My imagination, my ability to understand the way love and people grow over time, how passion can surprise and renew, utterly failed me.": "Elizabeth",
  "Possessing a healthy imagination is a necessary ingredient for creativity.": "Steve",
  "There are one or two very good women military historians who use imagination, great study and research; they can put themselves in the boots of the soldier.": "Antony",
  "I just love music - by no stretch of the imagination am I professionally competent.": "Vikram",
  "I understand what it is to go through emotional trauma and retreat and go into the world of your imagination. I understand how art and music can be a place of safety in a world of reinvention.": "Sam",
  "I live in words. I like looking at things, but I don't have a strong visual imagination.": "Colm",
  "I think what's really the most ideal thing is for the player themselves, within their own imagination, to carve out what they view as being the essence of the character.": "Shigeru",
  "Being an actor means asking people to look at you. I guess I accept that. But it's a profession in which the job is to show another world and other people. You may access it through bits of yourself, and your imagination and experience, but actually, in the end, you're not playing yourself.": "Ralph",
  "I find Godzilla exciting because he/she/it comes from the sea. It's entirely plausible that it could be real. Yes it is! It doesn't take a huge stretch in the imagination to imagine that something may be living at the deepest depths of one of our oceans.": "Rhys",
  "Every time you get on a stage or in front of a camera, the whole exercise is about imagination. You're constantly depicting something that doesn't exist, and trying to find the reality of it. Once you settle on that premise, everything else is a matter of degrees.": "Ron",
  "The Polar Express is about faith, and the power of imagination to sustain faith. It's also about the desire to reside in a world where magic can happen, the kind of world we all believed in as children, but one that disappears as we grow older.": "Chris",
  "The general effect of viewing 'Jumanji' is thrilling. I was able to see on film a thing that at one point had only existed in my imagination. I got to see the images from my book come alive.": "Chris",
  "There is nothing heavier than compassion. Not even one's own pain weighs so heavy as the pain one feels for someone, for someone, pain intensified by the imagination and prolonged by a hundred echos.": "Milan",
  "I enjoy working on a movie that lets your imagination run wild, it's great to be a part of and watch.": "Chris",
  "When I was a teenager, reading for me was as normal, as unremarkable as eating or breathing. Reading gave flight to my imagination and strengthened my understanding of the world, the society I lived in, and myself. More importantly, reading was fun, a way to live more than one life as I immersed myself in each good book I read.": "Malorie",
  "Cynicism and naivety lie cheek by jowl in the American imagination; if the United States is one of the most venal nations on Earth, it is also one of the most earnestly idealistic.": "Terry",
  "I have been afraid all my life that I am going to die. All my life it has been stuffed in my imagination.": "Patty",
  "When I achieved the European record for reciting pi in 2004, this captured the imagination of Professor Simon Baron-Cohen in Cambridge, and he finally diagnosed me with Asperger's that year.": "Daniel",
  "If when we are taught English we are just taught the rules of grammar, it would take all our love of our language away from us. What makes us love a subject like English is when we learn all these fantastic stories. Feeding the imagination is what makes a subject come alive.": "Daniel",
  "I think most of the time you can make something happen, and it's about not letting your imagination be limited by that.": "Jane",
  "Imagination is Reality Lite - a useful substitute when the real pleasure is inaccessible, too risky, or too much work.": "Paul",
  "Imagination tends to be truly useful if accompanied by the power of mental control - if the worlds in one's head can be purposefully manipulated and distinguished from the real one outside it.": "Paul",
  "I box two to three times a week. I don't like going to the gym because it's boring. I really like boxing because you have to combine concentration and imagination. I feel like I'm actually learning something that's useful.": "Stephanie",
  "People who don't see their nature and imagine they can practice thoughtlessness all the time are lairs and fools.": "Bodhidharma",
  "Toy Soldiers was my introduction to film. I certainly didn't think I was doing art by any stretch of the imagination.": "Tim",
  "I can get very philosophical and ask the questions Keats was asking as a young guy. What are we here for? What's a soul? What's it all about? What is thinking about, imagination?": "Jane",
  "There's no artist in this world that doesn't enjoy the dream that if they have bad reviews now, the story of Keats can redeem them, in their fantasy or imagination, in the future. I think Keats' poem 'Endymion' is a really difficult poem, and I'm not surprised that a lot of people pulled it apart in a way.": "Jane",
  "I feel that directors at times are like the janitors on the set. I am the secretary, I am the organizer, I am the maid, and I ask if they have eaten or rested. The best things are always out of your control. It's those moments that surpass the imagination that are thrilling.": "Jane",
  "God has given us an imagination, and our imagination is really the principle tool from which all creativity and artistry comes from.": "Erwin",
  "You can have 10 bucks to 10 million bucks and if you got a crew, imagination and a lot of people willing to turn in some work next to nothing, you going to have a feature. But you can't get beyond how expensive marketing the movie is, it's so crushing.": "Kevin",
  "As an actor you have to have a strong vivid imagination as you're working and when the camera's rolling, but there's certainly a part of you that is aware of real life, that you're making a movie.": "John",
  "For memory, we use our imagination. We take a few strands of real time and carry them with us, then like an oyster we create a pearl around them.": "John",
  "The first piece of music that captured my imagination was probably Ray Charles Live At Newport.": "Van",
  "Learn to see things as they really are, not as we imagine they are.": "Vernon",
  "Reason respects the differences, and imagination the similitudes of things.": "Percy",
  "If the reporter has killed our imagination with his truth, he threatens our life with his lies.": "Karl",
  "There's no reason for your imagination to be fettered by money.": "Kevin",
  "I have a vivid, apocalyptic imagination.": "Sally",
  "There's just so many great stories in the past that you can know a little bit about, but you can't know it all, and that's where imagination can work.": "Geraldine",
  "My greatest strength as a child, I realize now, was my imagination. While every other kid was reading and writing, I had seven whole hours a day to practice my imagination. When do you get that space in your life, ever?": "Barbara",
  "Writing is a mysterious process, and many ideas come from deep within the imagination, so it's very hard to say how characters come about. Mostly, they just happen.": "Michelle",
  "All the best have something in common, a regard for reality, an agreement to its primacy over the imagination.": "Wislawa",
  "Politics is the enemy of the imagination.": "Ian",
  "The goal of 'Data Detectives' is to spark the imagination of students around the globe by making them think about new technologies that will impact humanity in ways similar to language and art.": "Rick",
  "For a 12-year-old with a hyperactive imagination who liked to dream of dreary gothic castles, suburban Florida felt a little stifling.": "Ransom",
  "My books are elegiac in the sense that they're odes to a nation that even I sometimes think may not exist anymore except in my memory and my imagination.": "Richard",
  "All of the stuff I can't afford to do on a TV budget, I just put into the comic book because you're really only limited in a comic by your artist's imagination.": "Marc",
  "Any acting is a stretch of the imagination. That's your job. Acting is truth in imaginary circumstances. Acting with green screen or a motion capture stage, you're striving for absolute truth in absolutely imaginary circumstances.": "Sam",
  "To me, stretching the capabilities of my imagination is a crucial aspect of writing fiction; you could think of it as a mental form of athleticism.": "Julia",
  "As a little girl, my destiny was stamped onto the canvas of my imagination at 5 years old. I was watching soaps with my grandmother... The most gorgeous black women I had ever seen in my life came out, and I knew that that is what I wanted to do - be fabulous and black and on TV.": "Niecy",
  "When you are a people's movement, you have one thing. Your only asset is people. And you have to deal with real people. Not the people of your imagination. Not the people you wish people would be. But people as they exist actually out there in the real world.": "Norman",
  "Three centuries after the appearance of Franklin's 'Courant', it no longer requires a dystopic imagination to wonder who will have the dubious distinction of publishing America's last genuine newspaper. Few believe that newspapers in their current printed form will survive.": "Eric",
  "I guess just a lively imagination is the best effort an actor can have.": "Jacki",
  "There's something magical about a home run. It almost violates the space of the stadium. It's a game of the imagination in some ways. Baseball.": "Alex",
  "Radio listeners often have a very fertile imagination when it comes to body shape.": "Tamsin",
  "I believed in myself. I never imagined myself as just an ordinary player.": "Imran",
  "If my accent betrayed my foreign birth, it also stamped me as an enemy, in the imagination of the producers.": "Bela",
  "I always won in my imagination. I always hit the game-winning shot, or I hit the free throw. Or if I missed, there was a lane violation, and I was given another one.": "Mike",
  "Imagination has a great deal to do with winning.": "Mike",
  "To say that such-and-such a circumstance is 'Kafkaesque' is to admit to the denigration of an imagination that has burned a hole in what we take to be modernism - even in what we take to be the ordinary fabric and intent of language. Nothing is like 'The Hunger Artist.' Nothing is like 'The Metamorphosis.'": "Cynthia",
  "I don't agree with the sentiment 'write what you know.'... I think one should write what one doesn't know. The world is bigger and wider and more complex than our small subjective selves. One should prod, goad the imagination.": "Cynthia",
  "My children have been all over the world, and I think it's so good for them: expanding their horizons and imagination and seeing how other people live.": "Keeley",
  "London has always provided the landscape for my imagination. It becomes a character - a living being - within each of my books.": "Peter",
  "I have always believed that the material world is governed by nonmaterial sources, so that in that sense 'English Music' is an exercise in the spiritual as well as the material. I have always been attracted to the Gothic and spiritual imagination, and I've always been interested in visionaries.": "Peter",
  "When I was a boy, I was a worrier, and so was my son, Joe. I used to tell him that worrying meant he had an imagination and that one day he'd be pleased.": "Anthony",
  "Inspiring passion in children for books, and the world of imagination and creativity fuelled by them, is a fundamental reason for why the Children's Laureate post exists.": "Anthony",
  "Picture books are for everybody at any age, not books to be left behind as we grow older. The best ones leave a tantalising gap between the pictures and the words, a gap that is filled by the reader's imagination, adding so much to the excitement of reading a book.": "Anthony",
  "There's so much more that I want to do. Of course it's great what has happened so far: Ultra, Coachella, EDC. But still, production-wise and show-wise, I'd love to play a show at Madison Square Garden. Stuff like that is beyond my imagination.": "Martin",
  "My daughter has a vivid imagination, and so does my son.": "Nicole",
  "Every parent knows this moment in a child's age when he or she needs your attention in a very specific way because it's the beginning and ending of the early life of imagination. It's such a responsibility.": "Nicole",
  "I still have a photo on my wall of the greatest idol I will ever have in my life, and it's myself at eight. Because that's when the forces of imagination have the same value as the real world, when they're an instrument of survival: when my mother disappeared, and I imagined a mother. That was me at my best.": "Henning",
  "Humiliating events have a way of capturing the public's imagination. So it has been since antiquity, when gladiators were pitted against each other and the legions of Spartacus were crucified in endless rows on the way to Rome.": "Gary",
  "I became a novelist because of 'Gone With the Wind,' or more precisely, my mother raised me up to be a 'Southern' novelist, with a strong emphasis on the word 'Southern' because 'Gone With the Wind' set my mother's imagination ablaze when she was a young girl growing up in Atlanta.": "Pat",
  "My approach as an actor has always been the same, in that the greatest gift that you're ever going to have is your imagination because you're not going to have all life experiences. So you draw on things that are sort of close to it but you spend your time expanding on it or drawing something specific on whatever your situation is.": "Vince",
  "I do as much comedy as I possibly can, but I'm basically limited by the imagination of the secretaries who make the decisions.": "Rufus",
  "Only World War II, which mobilized 10 million draftees, could by any stretch of the imagination be called a people's war.": "John",
  "I've been working on the soprano saxophone for 40 years, and the possibilities are astounding. It's up to you, the only limit is the imagination.": "Steve",
  "I deeply adored my mum. She was an extraordinary person, even for the prejudice I'm likely to have. She was beautiful, amusing, a tremendous elaborator of things into comic proportions and extravagant in her imagination.": "Andrew",
  "I have an active imagination.": "Anya",
  "Reading changes your perspective and feeds your imagination.": "Najat",
  "I like to have a thing suggested rather than told in full. When every detail is given, the mind rests satisfied, and the imagination loses the desire to use its own wings.": "Thomas",
  "Dwellers by the sea are generally superstitious sailors always are. There is something in the illimitable expanse of sky and water that dilates the imagination.": "Thomas",
  "To my mind the boy who gives least promise is one in whom the critical faculty develops in advance of the imagination.": "Quintilian",
  "Life-writing calls for any number of dubious gifts: A touch of O.C.D., a lack of imagination, a large desk, neutrality of Swiss proportions, tactlessness, a high tolerance for archival dust. Most of all it calls for an act of displacement. 'To find your subject, you must in some sense lose yourself along the way,' is Richard Holmes's version.": "Stacy",
  "I ask questions. I watch the world. And what I have discovered is that the parts of my fiction that people most tell me are 'unbelievable' are those that are most closely based on the real, those least diluted by my imagination.": "Chimamanda",
  "I just can't afford to get bored, because if you've been blessed with a generous imagination, which a lot of actors have, to be engaged, to be stimulated, is to liberate your imagination.": "John",
  "To be in a show like 'Miranda' that captures everyone's imagination is amazing, but it's hard when people can't see beyond that. I started travelling to North America because 'Miranda' was so popular in the U.K.; I always knew I wanted to challenge myself and not go for the obvious roles.": "Tom",
  "I use a lot of film images, analogies, and imagination.": "Carlos",
  "I feel very giddy with the idea of making my imagination take form and being able to put on a show where people leave feeling like they've experienced something.": "Carly",
  "We are fascinated with our own history, and we are fascinated with the Romans because they were millennia ago, and yet they still capture our imagination because they were actually so similar to us. They were very civilized. They had a very similar political system.": "Kit",
  "I write from my imagination, not from what I've read in books or seen on TV or to make money. I wrote from an idea I was passionate about.": "Dirk",
  "They seem much rarer now, those auteur films that come out of a director's imagination and are elliptical and hermetic. All those films that got me into independent cinema when I was watching it seem thin on the ground.": "Toby",
  "The idea was always going to be that each year is a stand-alone story, which did make it easier on some level. It also requires the network to have the creative imagination to say, 'This is also 'Fargo,' you know what I mean?": "Noah",
  "Meeting Australian mountaineer and author Tim Macartney-Snape when I was 16 in 1994 had a big impact on me. His ascent of Everest from sea to summit captured my imagination.": "Tim",
  "An idea is a putting truth in check-mate.": "Jose",
  "The imagination is man's power over nature.": "Wallace",
  "To regard the imagination as metaphysics is to think of it as part of life, and to think of it as part of life is to realize the extent of artifice. We live in the mind.": "Wallace",
  "I'm an emotional sort of person in general and I have a vivid imagination, so I feel the whole spectrum of emotion strongly when I write.": "Erin",
  "My favorite literature to read is fairly dry history. I like the framework, and my imagination can do the rest.": "Andrew",
  "You have to just go with your imagination, where your instinct takes you.": "Peter",
  "Your primary tools, as an actor, are observation and imagination. You can pretty much get everything you need from that, and you do. It brings back that element of pretend.": "Stephen",
  "On some level, acting is the art of pretend, and you have to have a highly cultivated sense of imagination. You have to be able to see things that aren't there, no matter what aspect of acting, whether it's green screen, whether it's on stage, whether it's anything else, whether you're working on the radio.": "Stephen",
  "The nomads' egalitarian lifestyle astonished the Greeks, who kept their own women indoors weaving and minding children. The exotic Scythian lifestyle fueled the Greek imagination and led to an outpouring of myths about fierce Amazons, 'the equals of men.'": "Adrienne",
  "We know their names: Hippolyta, Antiope, Thessalia. But they were long thought to be just travelers' tales or products of the Greek storytelling imagination. A lot of scholars still argue that. But archaeology has now proven without a doubt that there really were women fitting the description that the Greeks gave us of Amazons and warrior women.": "Adrienne",
  "The opportunities of man are limited only by his imagination. But so few have imagination that there are ten thousand fiddlers to one composer.": "Charles",
  "Ideas control the world.": "James",
  "In an era of parental paranoia, lawsuit mania and testing frenzy, we are failing to inspire our children's curiosity, creativity, and imagination. We are denying them opportunities to tinker, discover, and explore - in short, to play.": "Darell",
  "Ultimately, so much Dr. Seuss is about empowerment. He invites us to disappear into our imagination and then blows the doors off what that can mean.": "Gary",
  "Imagination creates some big monsters.": "Olivier",
  "A young imagination is bold, likes to make bigger leaps. It likes to, well, imagine that the dustbuster is a dinosaur; that the computer mouse is a hotrod; that the box is a cave; that the rawhide is a torch... or a baton... or something.": "Mo",
  "I like to build a character, trying to stretch my imagination as far to the walls of my brain as I can to come up with something that feels truthful and feels real - as close to the skin as I can get it.": "Uzo",
  "I think of myself as a little kid, and I had a wild imagination, but it was something that was encouraged and supported, which helped steer me into the arts.": "Uzo",
  "Love is based on imagination.": "Olivier",
  "But in my imagination this whole thing developed and I started mixing up old folk songs with the Beatles beat and taking them down to Greenwich Village and playing them for the people there.": "Roger",
  "I sort of jumped out of movies and into the lifeboat of comics. I loved it right away. It was the opposite of film school. Whatever was in my imagination could end up in the finished product. There were just no limitations.": "Brian",
  "That was the appealing thing about comics: There literally is no budget in comics. You're only limited by your imagination.": "Brian",
  "Let's be clear - for people like me, who are obsessed with story and for whom words are their medium, writing is the best job possible. I work hard, but I earn more than the national average wage while I play with my imagination, and for me, that's a dream.": "Sara",
  "I used to write stories a lot because you had to fill your hours some other way than watching television. So my imagination was vivid, and I used to write a lot of stories. I wrote a novel, which I still have, which is so awful.": "Robert",
  "Imagination is not the exclusive appanage of artists, but belongs in varying degrees to all men.": "George",
  "Philosophy and Art both render the invisible visible by imagination.": "George",
  "Clearly, some creative thinking is badly needed if humans are to have a future beyond Earth. Returning to the Moon may be worthy and attainable, but it fails to capture the public's imagination. What does get people excited is the prospect of a mission to Mars.": "Paul",
  "I feel like the Internet needs to be disarmed in some way. There needs to be a philosophical undermining of the Internet. We take it too seriously and too literally. For a reference we go to Wikipedia, which is full of inaccuracies and misinformation. It's kind of beautiful - it's all the product of imagination; it's not reality at all.": "Sufjan",
  "When I start a picture, I always have a script, but I change it every day. I put in what occurs to me that day out of my imagination. You start on a voyage; you know where you will end up but not what will occur along the way. You want to be surprised.": "Federico",
  "You will obtain a vision of matter that is perhaps fatiguing for your imagination, but pure and stripped of what the requirements of life make you add to it in external perception.": "Henri",
  "Classical plays require more imagination and more general training to be able to do. That's why I like playing Shakespeare better than anything else.": "Vivien",
  "I do not 'get' ideas ideas get me.": "Robertson",
  "All art, from the paintings on the walls of cave dwellers to art created today, is autobiographical because it comes from the secret place in the soul where imagination resides.": "Gloria",
  "We imagine that we want to escape our selfish and commonplace existence, but we cling desperately to our chains.": "Anne",
  "Trust that little voice in your head that says 'Wouldn't it be interesting if...' And then do it.": "Duane",
  "I believe in the imagination. What I cannot see is infinitely more important than what I can see.": "Duane",
  "In my imagination yes, I remember, when I was six years old, I was conducting all this concert in my house. But now it's real.": "Gustavo",
  "The peculiar fascination which the South held over my imagination and my limited capital decided me in favor of Atlanta University so about the last of September I bade farewell to the friends and scenes of my boyhood and boarded a train for the South. ": "James",
  "Suffering, it turns out, demands profound imagination. A new future has to be conjured up because the old future isn't there anymore.": "Rob",
  "I have an imagination because my life is so boring that my imagination lets me get off the reality of what's going on.": "Dave",
  "I used to lie in bed in my flat and imagine what would happen if there was a zombie attack.": "Simon",
  "You need imagination in order to imagine a future that doesn't exist.": "Azar",
  "I try to decorate my imagination as much as I can.": "Franz",
  "What does it mean to be Catholic and not a Catholic? I feel adrift, homeless. My Catholic imagination allows me to see the soul as a lit breath, seeking the divine. It persists.": "Julianna",
  "I am putting real plums into an imaginary cake.": "Mary",
  "The violent quarrel between the abstractionists and the surrealists seems to me quite unnecessary. All good art has contained both abstract and surrealist elements, just as it has contained both classical and romantic elements - order and surprise, intellect and imagination, conscious and unconscious.": "Henry",
  "From a very young age, stories fuelled my imagination in the most wonderful way.": "Hayley",
  "We are all afraid for our confidence, for the future, for the world. That is the nature of the human imagination. Yet every man, every civilization, has gone forward because of its engagement with what it has set itself to do.": "Jacob",
  "Predating the Internet and predating videos, you had an active imagination. You would hear sounds and then get mental pictures of what these sounds felt like to you. It engaged you and made you more invested in it. It made you want to get tickets to the show, buy the album, put the poster on the wall. Now it's sensory overload.": "Q-Tip",
  "I grew up in Sierra Leone, in a small village where as a boy my imagination was sparked by the oral tradition of storytelling. At a very young age I learned the importance of telling stories - I saw that stories are the most potent way of seeing anything we encounter in our lives, and how we can deal with living.": "Ishmael",
  "For imagination sets the goal picture which our automatic mechanism works on. We act, or fail to act, not because of will, as is so commonly believed, but because of imagination.": "Maxwell",
  "Vision is the true creative rhythm.": "Robert",
  "Then I decided to draw from and on my own imagination, and everything came out perfect.": "Jack",
  "We have the universe to roam in in imagination. It is our virtue to be infinitely varied. The worst tyranny is uniformity.": "George",
  "History releases me from my own experience and jogs my fictional imagination.": "Jennifer",
  "Imagination is at the root of much that passes for love.": "Gilbert",
  "A person possessed with an idea cannot be reasoned with.": "James",
  "Writing for children isn't easy. Kids will abandon a story that doesn't interest, enchant, delight, thrill, or terrify them. But when you can find a way into a young reader's imagination through something as simple as words on paper, well, there's nothing more satisfying.": "Kate",
  "I've always had this in a kind of worst-case dark imagination. I want to know what the dark form in the window is. I want to know what the noise under the staircase is.": "Lisa",
  "I had been a reporter for 15 years when I set out to write my first novel. I knew how to research an article or profile a subject - skills that I assumed would be useless when it came to fiction. It was from my imagination that the characters in my story would emerge.": "Amy",
  "Children do not give up their innate imagination, curiosity, dreaminess easily. You have to love them to get them to do that.": "R.",
  "My mother was making $135 a week, but she had resilience and imagination. She might take frozen vegetables, cook them with garlic, onion and Spam, and it would taste like a four-star dinner.": "Andre",
  "No, no, I don't watch football. The last time I tried watching was the last Super Bowl. The problem I have is, you know, the graphic nature of my imagination; when I watch and see them meeting head onto head, helmet onto helmet, what flashes through my mind is what's going on in their brains. It's like torture to me.": "Bennet",
  "I love using my imagination. I love writing about animals.": "Mary",
  "I am imagination. I can see what the eyes cannot see. I can hear what the ears cannot hear. I can feel what the heart cannot feel.": "Peter",
  "Never forget that the key to the situation lies in the will and not in the imagination.": "Evelyn",
  "The American imagination has never been able to fully recover from its white-supremacist beginnings.": "Claudia",
  "I have a darker imagination than most people.": "Edan",
  "Writers to some extent are childish, and it's at the childish level that one really engages with any experience. What really moves you is at the very personal, childish level of the imagination. My business is the imagination, and my imagination is engaged by Asia.": "Christopher",
  "Each one seems to be, in some way, essentially different from the others, and each is a surprise to me. I think that making books, or any kind of art, might also be like mining. The artist digs into his or her life and imagination and never knows what they'll find. That's the adventure.": "Mordicai",
  "I love the paranormal, because there, every genre I write can become one beacon for my imagination.": "Leslie",
  "Imagination is an instrument of survival.": "Rogier",
  "Imagination, the traitor of the mind, has taken my solitude and slain it.": "Robinson",
  "The imagination is a pretty precious source of protection.": "Nicholas",
  "Dreaming is an act of pure imagination, attesting in all men a creative power, which if it were available in waking, would make every man a Dante or Shakespeare.": "Frederick",
  "I consider myself very fortunate indeed to have created a character which has captured the imagination and enthusiasm of so many children worldwide. They are my family, and Spot belongs to them all.": "Eric",
  "Nowadays people's visual imagination is so much more sophisticated, so much more developed, particularly in young people, that now you can make an image which just slightly suggests something, they can make of it what they will.": "Robert",
  "I want to be on the screen, I want to play dress up every day, I want be different people, I want to have fun, and I want to use my imagination.": "Skyler",
  "I am better able to imagine hell than heaven; it is my inheritance, I suppose.": "Elinor",
  "Life would have been absolutely empty without imagination.": "Jack",

  "My painting does not come from the easel.": "Jackson",
  "Without tradition, art is a flock of sheep without a shepherd. Without innovation, it is a corpse.": "Winston",
  "If you hear a voice within you say 'you cannot paint,' then by all means paint, and that voice will be silenced.": "Vincent",
  "Some painters transform the sun into a yellow spot, others transform a yellow spot into the sun.": "Pablo",
  "Art is not a handicraft, it is the transmission of feeling the artist has experienced.": "Leo",
  "Advertising is the art of convincing people to spend money they don't have for something they don't need.": "Will",
  "The artist is a receptacle for emotions that come from all over the place: from the sky, from the earth, from a scrap of paper, from a passing shape, from a spider's web.": "Pablo",
  "Creative without strategy is called 'art.' Creative with strategy is called 'advertising.'": "Jef",
  "I don't want life to imitate art. I want life to be art.": "Ernst",
  "Where there is no human connection, there is no compassion. Without compassion, then community, commitment, loving-kindness, human understanding, and peace all shrivel. Individuals become isolated, the isolated turn cruel, and the tragic hovers in the forms of domestic and civil violence. Art and literature are antidotes to that.": "Susan",
  "Every human is an artist. And this is the main art that we have: the creation of our story.": "Don",
  "The art of simplicity is a puzzle of complexity.": "Douglas",
  "I prefer drawing to talking. Drawing is faster, and leaves less room for lies.": "Le",
  "Personality is everything in art and poetry.": "Johann",
  "Insight is the first condition of Art.": "George",
  "An intellectual says a simple thing in a hard way. An artist says a hard thing in a simple way.": "Charles",
  "Art is never finished, only abandoned.": "Leonardo",
  "The true artist is not proud: he unfortunately sees that art has no limits; he feels darkly how far he is from the goal, and though he may be admired by others, he is sad not to have reached that point to which his better genius only appears as a distant, guiding sun.": "Ludwig",
  "Color is my day-long obsession, joy and torment.": "Claude",
  "Every painting is a voyage into a sacred harbour.": "Giotto",

  "Be slow to fall into friendship; but when thou art in, continue firm and constant.": "Socrates",
  "To say the word Romanticism is to say modern art - that is, intimacy, spirituality, color, aspiration towards the infinite, expressed by every means available to the arts.": "Charles",
  "To me, photography is an art of observation. It's about finding something interesting in an ordinary place... I've found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.": "Elliott",
  "Art is the most beautiful of all lies.": "Claude",
  "Inspiration comes from everywhere: books, art, people on the street. It is an interior process for me.": "Colleen",
  "If you're not trying to be real, you don't have to get it right. That's art.": "Andy",
  "In art, there is no need for color; I see only light and shade. Give me a crayon, and I will paint your portrait.": "Francisco",
  "There are no contests in the Art of Peace. A true warrior is invincible because he or she contests with nothing. Defeat means to defeat the mind of contention that we harbor within.": "Morihei",
  "I don't think about art when I'm working. I try to think about life.": "Jean-Michel",
  "A museum is a spiritual place. People lower their voices when they get close to art.": "Mario",
  "Pop Art looks out into the world. It doesn't look like a painting of something, it looks like the thing itself.": "Roy",
  "In mathematics the art of proposing a question must be held of higher value than solving it.": "Georg",
  "It's very important that we re-learn the art of resting and relaxing. Not only does it help prevent the onset of many illnesses that develop through chronic tension and worrying; it allows us to clear our minds, focus, and find creative solutions to problems.": "Thich",
  "Diplomacy is the art of saying 'Nice doggie' until you can find a rock.": "Will",
  "True art is characterized by an irresistible urge in the creative artist.": "Albert",
  "The wonders of the Grand Canyon cannot be adequately represented in symbols of speech, nor by speech itself. The resources of the graphic art are taxed beyond their powers in attempting to portray its features. Language and illustration combined must fail.": "John",
  "Art should be an oasis: a place or refuge from the hardness of life.": "Fernando",
  "The walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds.": "Theo",
  "Because advertising and marketing is an art, the solution to each new problem or challenge should begin with a blank canvas and an open mind, not with the nervous borrowings of other people's mediocrities. That's precisely what 'trends' are - a search for something 'safe' - and why a reliance on them leads to oblivion.": "George",
  "The art of living is more like wrestling than dancing.": "Marcus",
  "The art of a people is a true mirror to their minds.": "Jawaharlal",
  "I like to change. A new lamp, a piece of art, can transform a room.": "Madonna",
  "There will be very few occasions when you are absolutely certain about anything. You will consistently be called upon to make decisions with limited information. That being the case, your goal should not be to eliminate uncertainty. Instead, you must develop the art of being clear in the face of uncertainty.": "Andy",
  "I never know what I'm going to put on the canvas. The canvas paints itself. I'm just the middleman.": "Peter",
  "Well, Art is Art, isn't it? Still, on the other hand, water is water. And east is east and west is west and if you take cranberries and stew them like applesauce they taste much more like prunes than rhubarb does. Now you tell me what you know.": "Groucho",
  "The study of the art of motorcycle maintenance is really a miniature study of the art of rationality itself. Working on a motorcycle, working well, caring, is to become part of a process, to achieve an inner peace of mind. The motorcycle is primarily a mental phenomenon.": "Robert",
  "I believe the target of anything in life should be to do it so well that it becomes an art.": "Arsene",
  "Painting is an infinitely minute part of my personality.": "Salvador",
  "Animation is not the art of drawings that move but the art of movements that are drawn.": "Norman",
  "Drawing is like making an expressive gesture with the advantage of permanence.": "Henri",
  "Art is the window to man's soul. Without it, he would never be able to see beyond his immediate world; nor could the world see the man within.": "Lady",
  "An artist must be free to choose what he does, certainly, but he must also never be afraid to do what he might choose.": "Langston",
  "Art! Who comprehends her? With whom can one consult concerning this great goddess?": "Ludwig",
  "Only in art will the lion lie down with the lamb, and the rose grow without the thorn.": "Martin",
  "The strangeness will wear off and I think we will discover the deeper meanings in modern art.": "Jackson",
  "To an engineer, good enough means perfect. With an artist, there's no such thing as perfect.": "Alexander",
  "You can't do sketches enough. Sketch everything and keep your curiosity fresh.": "John",
  "The cinema is not a craft. It is an art. It does not mean teamwork. One is always alone on the set as before the blank page. And to be alone... means to ask questions. And to make films means to answer them.": "Jean-Luc",
  "There are no rules. That is how art is born, how breakthroughs happen. Go against the rules or ignore the rules. That is what invention is about.": "Helen",
  "It is the function of art to renew our perception. What we are familiar with we cease to see. The writer shakes up the familiar scene, and, as if by magic, we see a new meaning in it.": "Anais",
  "Everyone discusses my art and pretends to understand, as if it were necessary to understand, when it is simply necessary to love.": "Claude",
  "Simplicity and repose are the qualities that measure the true value of any work of art.": "Frank",
  "My art originates from hallucinations only I can see. I translate the hallucinations and obsessional images that plague me into sculptures and paintings.": "Yayoi",
  "What art is, in reality, is this missing link, not the links which exist. It's not what you see that is art; art is the gap.": "Marcel",
  "To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event.": "Henri",
  "With just one polka dot, nothing can be achieved. In the universe, there is the sun, the moon, the earth, and hundreds of millions of stars. All of us live in the unfathomable mystery and infinitude of the universe. Pursuing 'philosophy of the universe' through art under such circumstances has led me to what I call 'stereotypical repetition.'": "Yayoi",
  "In art, at a certain level, there is no 'better than.' It's just about trying to operate for yourself on the most supreme level, artistically, that you can and hoping that people get it. Trusting that, just because of the way people are built and how interconnected we are, greatness will translate and symmetry will be recognised.": "Frank",
  "A picture book is a small door to the enormous world of the visual arts, and they're often the first art a young person sees.": "Tomie",
  "A man paints with his brains and not with his hands.": "Michelangelo",
  "Art is a harmony parallel with nature.": "Paul",
  "Art doesn't transform. It just plain forms.": "Roy",

  "All art is erotic.": "Gustav",
  "There is only one valuable thing in art: the thing you cannot explain.": "Georges",
  "Rhetoric may be defined as the faculty of observing in any given case the available means of persuasion. This is not a function of any other art.": "Aristotle",
  "The person who knows one thing and does it better than anyone else, even if it only be the art of raising lentils, receives the crown he merits. If he raises all his energy to that end, he is a benefactor of mankind and its rewarded as such.": "Og",
  "Impressionism is the newspaper of the soul.": "Henri",
  "There's no art to find the mind's construction in the face.": "William",
  "For art to exist, for any sort of aesthetic activity to exist, a certain physiological precondition is indispensable: intoxication.": "Friedrich",

  "There is nothing new in art except talent.": "Anton",
  "Pictures deface walls more often than they decorate them.": "William",

  "Politicians are masters of the art of deception.": "Martin",
  "I try to keep a low profile in general. Not with my art, but just as a person.": "Alanis",
  "For as long as I can remember I have suffered from a deep feeling of anxiety which I have tried to express in my art.": "Edvard",
  "Art is a way to express yourself and through that you can escape a bad situation.": "Russell",
  "A sculptor is a person who is interested in the shape of things, a poet in words, a musician by sounds.": "Henry",
  "What is comedy? Comedy is the art of making people laugh without making them puke.": "Steve",
  "Abstract art: a product of the untalented sold by the unprincipled to the utterly bewildered.": "Al",
  "It is after all the greatest art to limit and isolate oneself.": "Johann",
  "The history of modern art is also the history of the progressive loss of art's audience. Art has increasingly become the concern of the artist and the bafflement of the public.": "Paul",
  "To send light into the darkness of men's hearts - such is the duty of the artist.": "Robert",
  "The task of art today is to bring chaos into order.": "Theodor",

  "What is Art? It is the response of man's creative soul to the call of the Real.": "Rabindranath",
  "Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.": "Isaac",
  "For me, there is very little difference between magic and art. To me, the ultimate act of magic is to create something from nothing: It's like when the stage magician pulls the rabbit from the hat.": "Alan",
  "I always saw candy as art.": "Dylan",
  "The art of doing mathematics consists in finding that special case which contains all the germs of generality.": "David",

  "Art can only be truly art by presenting an adequate outward symbol of some fact in the interior life.": "Margaret",
  "Cleanliness is the scourge of art.": "Craig",

  "To curb the machine and limit art to handicraft is a denial of opportunity.": "Lewis",

  "Art does not reproduce what we see; rather, it makes us see.": "Paul",
  "Use the creative process - singing, writing, art, dance, whatever - to get to know yourself better.": "Catie",
  "There's traditionally been a large disconnection in contemporary art between the audience and the artist. Generally, audiences are looking towards what they like, and I can tell you, that's the last thing on an artist's mind.": "James",
  "London, thou art the flower of cities all!": "William",
  "Art is the fatal net which catches these strange moments on the wing like mysterious butterflies, fleeing the innocence and distraction of common men.": "Giorgio",

  "Photographing a cake can be art.": "Irving",
  "What I wanted to do was to paint sunlight on the side of a house.": "Edward",

  "Censorship is to art as lynching is to justice.": "Henry",
  "Art is not supposed to change the world, to change practical things, but to change perceptions. Art can change the way we see the world. Art can create an analogy.": "JR",
  "People discuss my art and pretend to understand as if it were necessary to understand, when it's simply necessary to love.": "Claude",
  "Art is accusation, expression, passion. Art is a fight to the finish between black charcoal and white paper.": "Gunter",
  "My daughter loves to do art stuff. As a father, I like to play with her. We break out the big pads of paper and the glitter and all the stuff. She likes to do what she likes to do. I want to do something, too. So I've just started using her same materials - a lot of crayons, a lot of sparkle, charcoal, pencils, markers and glue.": "Stone",
  "Parks are works of art just as a painting or sculpture is.": "Thomas",
  "Art is the elimination of the unnecessary.": "Pablo",
  "Art challenges technology, but technology inspires the art.": "John",
  "My art is not limited to the songs I create but also to the reaction it creates. I like to sit back and look at the whole thing as if it's a tornado that I'm controlling. It's creating chaos. When you create chaos, ideas are turned upside down, and everybody looks at things in a different way.": "Marilyn",
  "What goes on in abstract art is the proclaiming of aesthetic principles... It is in our own time that we have become aware of pure aesthetic considerations. Art never can be imitation.": "Hans",
  "Diplomacy, n. is the art of letting somebody else have your way.": "David",
  "Encouraging young people to believe in themselves and find their own voice whether it's through writing, drama or art is so important in giving young people a sense of self-worth.": "Michael",
  "I think that art is still a site for resistance and for the telling of various stories, for validating certain subjectivities we normally overlook. I'm trying to be affective, to suggest changes, and to resist what I feel are the tyrannies of social life on a certain level.": "Barbara",
  "I paint; I draw and paint - I've been doing that since I was in third grade, drawing realistically and then changing to abstract art. That was my first creative thing before guitar or comedy.": "Steven",
  "Art is interesting because there can be so many different perspectives in a piece of art. The way I see it may be completely different than the way somebody else sees it. It's interesting to hear what somebody sees in a piece of art compared to somebody else. It could be completely different, and that's interesting to me.": "Joakim",
  "I do not regard advertising as entertainment or an art form, but as a medium of information.": "David",
  "Writing stopped being fun when I discovered the difference between good writing and bad and, even more terrifying, the difference between it and true art. And after that, the whip came down.": "Truman",
  "A compromise is the art of dividing a cake in such a way that everyone believes he has the biggest piece.": "Ludwig",
  "I did study the art of being a barber because I wanted to figure out what my routine would be. Do you start in the front or back? Top or bottom? Swivel the chair or walk around? What I did discover is there's no such thing as the perfect haircut!": "Sean",
  "Art, like morality, consists in drawing the line somewhere.": "Gilbert",
  "When I am finishing a picture, I hold some God-made object up to it - a rock, a flower, the branch of a tree or my hand - as a final test. If the painting stands up beside a thing man cannot make, the painting is authentic. If there's a clash between the two, it's bad art.": "Marc",
  "Wisdom is nothing but a preparation of the soul, a capacity, a secret art of thinking, feeling and breathing thoughts of unity at every moment of life.": "Herman",
  "I think it's the pain and suffering that drive you to become an artist. The art itself should be the pain, sort of exorcising every demon and making you feel like you're a person that matters.": "Marilyn",
  "Art is the path to being spiritual.": "Piet",
  "It is Homer who has chiefly taught other poets the art of telling lies skillfully.": "Aristotle",
  "Art is the provocation for talking about enigma and the search for sense in human life. One can do that by telling a story or writing about a fresco by Giotto or studying how a snail climbs up a wall.": "John",
  "When the bright angel dominates, out comes a great work of art, a Michelangelo David or a Beethoven symphony.": "Madeleine",
  "Good manners is the art of making those people easy with whom we converse. Whoever makes the fewest people uneasy is the best bred in the room.": "Jonathan",
  "The orbit of human vision has widened and art has annexed fresh territories that were formerly denied to it.": "Max",
  "The highest art is always the most religious, and the greatest artist is always a devout person.": "Abraham",
  "I've been called many names like perfectionist, difficult and obsessive. I think it takes obsession, takes searching for the details for any artist to be good.": "Barbra",
  "The art of acceptance is the art of making someone who has just done you a small favor wish that he might have done you a greater one.": "Martin",
  "The art of motherhood involves much silent, unobtrusive self-denial, an hourly devotion which finds no detail too minute.": "Honore",
  "Our individual lives cannot, generally, be works of art unless the social order is also.": "Charles",

  "Art hurts. Art urges voyages - and it is easier to stay at home.": "Gwendolyn",
  "Life imitates art far more than art imitates Life.": "Oscar",

  "I am interested in mathematics only as a creative art.": "G.",
  "Democracy is the art of thinking independently together.": "Alexander",
  "Art is to me the glorification of the human spirit, and as such it is the cultural documentation of the time in which it is produced.": "Hans",
  "I come from a real working class background, and I didn't know anyone sophisticated - except I saw Edie Sedgewick once at the Art Museum in Philly. She had these black leotards and little black pumps and this big ermine cape and all these white dogs and black sunglasses and black eyes. She was classy!": "Patti",
  "Art is moral passion married to entertainment. Moral passion without entertainment is propaganda, and entertainment without moral passion is television.": "Rita",
  "The most momentous thing in human life is the art of winning the soul to good or evil.": "Pythagoras",
  "Guided only by their feeling for symmetry, simplicity, and generality, and an indefinable sense of the fitness of things, creative mathematicians now, as in the past, are inspired by the art of mathematics rather than by any prospect of ultimate usefulness.": "E.",
  "Postmodernism surely requires an even greater grasp of symbolism, as it's increasingly an art of gesture alone.": "Andrew",
  "So vast is art, so narrow human wit.": "Alexander",
  "I choose a block of marble and chop off whatever I don't need.": "Auguste",
  "The very essence of the creative is its novelty, and hence we have no standard by which to judge it.": "Carl",
  "That's why people listen to music or look at paintings. To get in touch with that wholeness.": "Corita",
  "The sculptor produces the beautiful statue by chipping away such parts of the marble block as are not needed - it is a process of elimination.": "Elbert",

  "When I work, and in my art, I hold hands with God.": "Robert",
  "I do not want art for a few any more than education for a few, or freedom for a few.": "William",

  "Politics is the art of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable.": "John",

  "The arts are not a way to make a living. They are a very human way of making life more bearable. Practicing an art, no matter how well or badly, is a way to make your soul grow, for heaven's sake.": "Kurt",
  "The old, sad art colors are gone. Now I paint bright colors. I paint paintings which are happy, where children are laughing and playing with animals. I paint paradise on Earth. I still paint sadness sometimes, but there is sadness in the world, too.": "Margaret",

  "I make static art, not dynamic art. That's what I do.": "Michael",
  "I love that works of art are printed so that anyone can buy them. The variety of what they put on little postcards astounds me.": "Leonard",

  "Back in third grade, they used to say, 'Take whatever talent you have and think of something you can do with it.' I liked to draw, but what could I do with it? Maybe I could be an art dealer - nah, can't see myself doing that. Maybe I could do commercial arts?": "The",

  "Art is much less important than life, but what a poor life without it.": "Robert",
  "The art of government is the organisation of idolatry.": "George",
  "The notion that the public accepts or rejects anything in modern art is merely romantic fiction. The game is completed and the trophies distributed long before the public knows what has happened.": "Tom",
  "The greater the decrease in the social significance of an art form, the sharper the distinction between criticism and enjoyment by the public. The conventional is uncritically enjoyed, and the truly new is criticized with aversion.": "Walter",
  "They say Princes learn no art truly, but the art of horsemanship. The reason is, the brave beast is no flatterer. He will throw a prince as soon as his groom.": "Ben",
  "Nothing right can be accomplished in art without enthusiasm.": "Robert",
  "Good art however 'immoral' is wholly a thing of virtue. Good art can NOT be immoral. By good art I mean art that bears true witness, I mean the art that is most precise.": "Ezra",
  "If a patron buys from an artist who needs money, the patron then makes himself equal to the artist; he is building art into the world; he creates.": "Ezra",
  "We work in the dark - we do what we can - we give what we have. Our doubt is our passion and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.": "Henry",

  "All the world old is queer save thee and me, and even thou art a little queer.": "Robert",
  "No art is any good unless you can feel how it's put together. By and large it's the eye, the hand and if it's any good, you feel the body. Most of the best stuff seems to be a complete gesture, the totality of the artist's body; you can really lean on it.": "Frank",

  "I think art is inherently nonviolent and it actually occupies your mind with creation rather than destruction.": "Anthony",

  "With color one obtains an energy that seems to stem from witchcraft.": "Henri",
  "Art gives people a reason to be alive.": "Marilyn",

  "The word 'art' interests me very much. If it comes from Sanskrit, as I've heard, it signifies 'making.' Now everyone makes something, and those who make things on a canvas with a frame, they're called artists. Formerly, they were called craftsmen, a term I prefer. We're all craftsmen, in civilian or military or artistic life.": "Marcel",

  "The basis of art is truth, both in matter and in mode.": "Flannery",

  "When you look at art made by other people, you see what you need to see in it.": "Alberto",
  "Actually I think Art lies in both directions - the broad strokes, big picture but on the other hand the minute examination of the apparently mundane. Seeing the whole world in a grain of sand, that kind of thing.": "Peter",
  "But I am a lover of all kinds of art. And I just can't stick to one thing. I guess I could if I made myself, but I'd always be looking the other way, for other things.": "Andre",

  "The marble not yet carved can hold the form of every thought the greatest artist has.": "Michelangelo",
  "I've always enjoyed feeling a connection to the avant-garde, such as Dada and surrealism and pop art. The only thing the artist can do is be honest with themselves and make the art they want to make. That's what I've always done.": "Jeff",

  "Anime is intended to have ambiguous features. That's part of the art form.": "M.",
  "I always imagined myself somehow as an electron around some atom, and you're just, like, bouncing around and spinning. There was a never-ending supply of places to go, people to see, things to do, and fitting it all in became kind of an art.": "Tom",

  "Someone made me a Leaf Coneybear finger puppet. Someone made me a portrait of me on some chocolate. I'm keeping it. I daren't eat such a work of art. It's so unique and so fun that fans do that. It's incredibly flattering. I like it when people spend time on me. People don't spend the same amount of time on my brother who's an insurance broker.": "Barrett",
  "Literature is the art of writing something that will be read twice journalism what will be grasped at once.": "Cyril",

  "We have lost the art of sharing and caring.": "Hun",
  "Art to me is an anecdote of the spirit, and the only means of making concrete the purpose of its varied quickness and stillness.": "Mark",
  "But what does interest me is the notion that if you do a lot of work it means there's a potential for other people to understand that a lot of things are possible with a sustained effort and that the broadening of experiences is possible and I think that's all art can be.": "Richard",
  "Very few people possess true artistic ability. It is therefore both unseemly and unproductive to irritate the situation by making an effort. If you have a burning, restless urge to write or paint, simply eat something sweet and the feeling will pass.": "Fran",

  "I owe much to mother. She had an expert's understanding, but also approached art emotionally.": "David",
  "I quickly realized that this medium had a lot to offer someone like me. To do Disney-quality hand-drawn cartoons, you have to be a master of two art forms. Seriously, you have to be able to draw like a Leonardo da Vinci or a Michelangelo. But also you have to know movement and timing and control that through 24 frames a second.": "John",
  "Art attracts us only by what it reveals of our most secret self.": "Jean-Luc",
  "For me, acting is about the art of it and it's about being on a film set and doing your thing, painting a blank canvas.": "Shailene",
  "As long as you're true to you, you believe it and you make others believe it, then what you're doing is just art. If you give everybody a blank canvas and some paint, not everybody's picture is going to be exactly the same, but it's still art. I just do what I do.": "Jake",
  "I don't feel I'm trying to make art. I'm trying to make interesting things. People can relate to that.": "Thomas",
  "My philosophy is that I'm an artist. I perform an art not with a paint brush or a camera. I perform with bodily movement. Instead of exhibiting my art in a museum or a book or on canvas, I exhibit my art in front of the multitudes.": "Steve",
  "There is so much art can do to enlighten people, no matter what their views might be. If art can't go there or doesn't elevate the social consciousness in some way, then we are in peril.": "Octavia",

  "Extreme complication is contrary to art.": "Claude",

  "The unique thing about our country is that we have Hindus, Muslims, Christians, Sikhs, Parsis, and people of all other religions. We have temples and mosques, gurdwaras and churches. But we do not bring all this into politics... This is the difference between India and Pakistan.": "Lal",
  "We all have our likes and our dislikes. But... when we're doing news - when we're doing the front-page news, not the back page, not the op-ed pages, but when we're doing the daily news, covering politics - it is our duty to be sure that we do not permit our prejudices to show. That is simply basic journalism.": "Walter",

  "In politics, nothing happens by accident. If it happens, you can bet it was planned that way.": "Franklin",

  "I think one of the great problems we have in the Republican Party is that we don't encourage you to be nasty. We encourage you to be neat, obedient, loyal and faithful and all those Boy Scout words, which would be great around a campfire but are lousy in politics.": "Newt",
  "I hate all politics. I don't like either political party. One should not belong to them - one should be an individual, standing in the middle. Anyone that belongs to a party stops thinking.": "Ray",

  "The modern conservative is engaged in one of man's oldest exercises in moral philosophy; that is, the search for a superior moral justification for selfishness.": "John",
  "Globalisation has made us more vulnerable. It creates a world without borders, and makes us painfully aware of the limitations of our present instruments, and of politics, to meet its challenges.": "Anna",
  "Politics is the ability to foretell what is going to happen tomorrow, next week, next month and next year. And to have the ability afterwards to explain why it didn't happen.": "Winston",
  "We are losing sight of civility in government and politics. Debate and dialogue is taking a back seat to the politics of destruction and anger and control. Dogma has replaced thoughtful discussion between people of differing views.": "James",

  "Either one lives 'for' politics or one lives 'off' politics.": "Max",
  "Our articles of confederation ought to be revised and measures immediately taken to invigorate the Continental Union. Depend upon it: there lies the danger for America.

  "You want a friend in Washington? Get a dog.": "Harry",

  "We live in a stage of politics, where legislators seem to regard the passage of laws as much more important than the results of their enforcement.": "William",
  "When I became prime minister last September, I promised the Japanese people that I would not tolerate the politics of indecision.

  "Honor is not the exclusive property of any political party.": "Herbert",
  "If the United States of America or Britain is having elections, they don't ask for observers from Africa or from Asia. But when we have elections, they want observers.": "Nelson",
  "But only 'rich' people by definition have the 'extra' money to buy things and invest to create economic growth. Do we really want to tax that 'extra' money away - and give it to the government to spend? Does that make any economic sense outside of politics and our emotional desire to make everyone suffer equally through these tough times?": "Terry",
  "Politics is the attempt to achieve power and prestige without merit.": "P.",
  "The new freedom of expression brought by the Internet goes far beyond politics. People relate to each other in new ways, posing questions about how we should respond to people when all that we know about them is what we have learned through a medium that permits all kinds of anonymity and deception.": "Peter",
  "We need more of the Office Desk and less of the Show Window in politics. Let men in office substitute the midnight oil for the limelight.": "Calvin",

  "There are many ways of encouraging people to make life better other than joining a political party. Politics with a small 'p' isn't just about darkened committee rooms, endless meetings - it is about giving people the right to make decisions about our lives.": "John",
  "I can tell you that too much money is corrupting American politics. Don't blame the American public. The U.S. Supreme Court has a lot to answer for, because it has made it impossible for Congress to reduce the corrupting influence of money on American political life.": "Peter",
  "The toughest thing to do in politics is to do the right thing when your supporters think the right thing is something else.": "Pat",
  "I do think the public want to see politicians acting in a different way. What's brought young people into our campaign is that they were written off by political parties but they had never written off politics, and what we have is a huge number of young people, very enthusiastic and brimming with ideas. Those ideas have got to be heard.": "Jeremy",
  "Poetry is about the grief. Politics is about the grievance.": "Robert",

  "If I use Facebook to stay in touch with my high school friends who are church-going Republicans, I may be getting more ideological diversity than in hanging out with secular progressives on the World Politics sub-reddit.": "Ethan",
  "Like any young person who gets into a political campaign, I joined out of a highfalutin' desire to change the world. But you start to see the sort of tactics people use. You start to see politics not only in the macro but in the micro of the campaign itself. Some people get turned off by this side of it. Other people are drawn to it.": "Beau",
  "One of biggest lies in politics is the lie that Republicans are the party of big business. Big business does great with big government. Big business is very happy to climb in bed with big government. Republicans are and should be the party of small business and of entrepreneurs.": "Ted",
  "Let us put the normal divisions of politics aside. Let us come together as one country let us seize this historic moment to shift the balance of power from the corridors of Westminster to the streets and communities of Scotland.": "Nicola",
  "Too often, we see wedge politics and petty rhetoric used to belittle adversaries and inflame partisan divisions.": "Larry",
  "People are just trying to work their jobs, raise their families, discipline their kids, and have a good life... Politics has just become like bad weather. And they deserve clear skies.": "Eddie",
  "It's not okay to lie about people and particularly not okay to hurl the worst imaginable names at people just because you think you might not like their politics.": "Milo",
  "In almost every country there are elements of opinion which would welcome such a conclusion because they wish to return to the politics of the balance of power, unrestricted and unregulated armaments, international anarchy, and preparation for war.": "Arthur",

  "It has been well said that a hungry man is more interested in four sandwiches than four freedoms.": "Henry",
  "I came back from university thinking I knew all about politics and racism, not knowing my dad had been one of the youngest-serving Labour councillors in the town and had refused to work in South Africa years ago because of the situation there. And he's never mentioned it - you just find out. That's a real man to me. A sleeping lion.": "Johnny",
  "We can create a new kind of politics: kinder, more respectful, but courageous, too.": "Jeremy",
  "Social media is natural to me, and it's a very immediate way of saying something. It's the way politics are done these days. In modern politics, you can't ignore that even if you wanted to. I can't imagine doing politics without it.": "Nicola",
  "My philosophy comes from a worldview that looks at the world as one. It's a holistic view that sees the world as interconnected and interdependent and integrated in so many different ways, which informs my politics.": "Dennis",
  "Being president is like being a jackass in a hailstorm. There's nothing to do but to stand there and take it.": "Lyndon",

  "One baby is a patient baby, and waits indefinitely until its mother is ready to feed it. The other baby is an impatient baby and cries lustily, screams and kicks and makes everybody unpleasant until it is fed. Well, we know perfectly well which baby is attended to first. That is the whole history of politics.": "Emmeline",

  "To rely upon conviction, devotion, and other excellent spiritual qualities; that is not to be taken seriously in politics.": "Vladimir",
  "And it turns out that tribes, not money, not factories, that can change our world, that can change politics, that can align large numbers of people. Not because you force them to do something against their will. But because they wanted to connect.": "Seth",
  "If nominated, I will not run; if elected, I will not serve.": "William",
  "When you are honest in your comedy, you have to acknowledge the world that you're in. Through a comedic voice, you're talking about what needs to be talked about, whether it's race relations or politics or anything that's happening on a global or an American scale.": "Trevor",
  "The idea that you can merchandise candidates for high office like breakfast cereal - that you can gather votes like box tops - is, I think, the ultimate indignity to the democratic process.": "Adlai",
  "An idea not coupled with action will never get any bigger than the brain cell it occupied.": "Arnold",
  "Vote for the man who promises least he'll be the least disappointing.": "Bernard",

  "The intersection of law, politics, and technology is going to force a lot of good thinking.": "Bill",
  "Politics is a tough game. But would I change places with a trauma nurse in an emergency ward on a busy Saturday night? No way. There are lots of jobs in the world that are tougher than politics. And politicians and people who've done it need to remember that.": "Michael",
  "They say politics is a contact sport, and I have to agree with that.": "Steve",
  "The Kingdom is the love of God prevailing in politics, in business, in government, in media.

  "At its worst, Washington is a place where name-calling partisan politics too often trumps policy.": "Bernie",

  "The similarities are limited but real. They amount to a shared disgust with politics as usual in America. The Tea Party focuses on the federal government Occupy Wall Street focuses on corporate America and its influence over the government. ": "George",
  "History and social sciences were my interests. I was always interested in knowing how societies get organized, why there is rich and poor divide, why there are classes. I was never apolitical. I think we are all political in a way. Politics decides our day-to-day life.": "Pawan",
  "Simply as an exercise in efficient politics, Obama '08 rewrote the textbook. His accomplishment was historic and one that transformed how race and politics intersect in our society. Obama is the leading edge of this change, but his success is merely the ripple in a pond that grows deeper every day.": "Gwen",
  "Authentic apology is a tricky thing to pull off in politics, which is why it so seldom occurs. Plausible deniability must be preserved. True contrition has to be displayed. Traitors to the cause must be immediately be jettisoned. Most of all, the goal is to stop the bleeding.": "Gwen",
  "The arts are the one thing that appeal right across all forms of politics, race, creed - everything.": "Andrew",
  "Art removes boundaries and makes the world brighter. It is the common language for people all over the world. But politics are the opposite completely. Politicians, their very meaning is based on the lines they draw.": "Asghar",

  "When you come from desperate poverty, and that's exactly what I come from, you know that nonsenses are not to be tolerated.

  "People have come to me for my opinion since 'October Baby.' But, hey, look, I'm an actor who is very fortunate to be in a movie that's making wonderful noise, and hopefully helping parents and children to be a little closer. Leave me alone.

  "Principles have no real force except when one is well-fed.": "Mark",
  "I think that politics needs a bit of spicing up.": "Nigel",
  "It's interesting how people who were once fairly radical can become, later in life, kind of conservative, and not just in terms of politics - how, if you're an artist, you can start out being somewhat avant-garde and then end up doing landscapes.": "Richard",

  "I am quite driven. I know what I think, and I know what I want to achieve, but I also hope that people who are asked to describe me would describe me as pretty down-to-earth, loyal, friendly. The more experience I have got in politics, I think the more I have allowed me to shine through.": "Nicola",

  "My publicist told me not to talk about politics but, yes, I think we have a president who stole the election.": "Liev",

  "You develop an instant global consciousness, a people orientation, an intense dissatisfaction with the state of the world, and a compulsion to do something about it. From out there on the moon, international politics looks so petty.": "Edgar",

  "I would remind you that extremism in the defense of liberty is no vice! And let me remind you also that moderation in the pursuit of justice is no virtue.": "Barry",

  "To balance China, the democracies will need new friends - and India with its fast-growing economy, youthful population, and democratic politics seems the obvious candidate.": "David",
  "I was very aware of office politics because I was so baffled by them. So much so goes unsaid. No one says 'you're a cheeky so-and-so,' no one says 'you're so moody,' nobody ever confronts anyone else about anything. But I'm very crass, and I'm very confrontational, and I have a temper. I had to be hyper-vigilant in every office I worked in.": "Denise",
  "Whenever anything extraordinary is done in American municipal politics, whether for good or for evil, you can trace it almost invariably to one man. The people do not do it. Neither do the 'gangs,' 'combines,' or political parties.": "Lincoln",

  "Power, in a nutshell, is the ability to get things done, and politics is the ability to decide which things need to be done.": "Zygmunt",

  "Trying to take money out of politics is like trying to take jumping out of basketball.": "Bill",
  "On the mountains mistakes are fatal. In politics, mistakes are wounding emotionally, but you recover. Personally, wilderness helps me get back in touch with natural rhythms, helps me reflect and, in the process, restore my creativity.": "Mark",
  "But I don't need to use politics as a way of making money.": "Imran",
  "Politics is about the improvement of people's lives. It's about advancing the cause of peace and justice in our country and the world. Politics is about doing well for the people.": "Paul",

  "I will go to the next election saying to Australians, vote for me, vote for the Liberal Party, and I will become your PM.

  "I worry about the direction of the U.K. and U.K. politics and governance in the event of a Brexit.": "Nicola",

  "I don't believe in gutter politics. I don't believe in gutter journalism.": "Maria",

  "Broadcasters or politicians or writers who think that they are respecting Struggle Street, the battlers, by dumbing things down into one-line sound bites are not respecting them, they are treating them with contempt.

  "There is a time for everything, also for my time in politics which has been long and eventful. Now I believe it is time for others to take the baton that was passed to me following the crash. I have therefore decided to leave political life at the end of this term.": "Johanna",
  "Democracy is a revelation, but it's complicated. There are elections to hold, politics to create, rights to assert, grievances to settle and institutions to build. To many, it's exhilarating. For others, it can be disappointing when it turns out that democracy doesn't immediately make life better.": "Atifete",
  "I think it is better when people with their own businesses and means of income join politics as there is some degree of honesty and integrity.": "Vijay",
  "The Beatles' story is all of our stories. It is about how the youth culture emerged, the drug culture emerged, how politics rose to the fore as a universal debate. It's about rebellion, it's about the growth of the British entertainment system, the growth of the rock n' roll entertainment system.": "Bob",
  "My view on politics is much more grassroots oriented; it's not old boy network oriented, so I tend to, you know, come at it a little bit stronger, a little bit more street-wise, if you will. That's rubbed some feathers the wrong way.": "Michael",

  "I keep trying to bring a more professional approach to New Zealand cricket. It's an uphill battle. I stay in the game because I find it intriguing and interesting.

  "Any criticism of Thatcher throws a dangerously absurd light on the entire machinery of British politics. Thatcher's name must be protected, not because of all the wrong that she had done, but because the people around her allowed her to do it.": "Morrissey",
  "Politics has got too personal, too nasty, in Britain, as it has in America.": "Dan",
  "All the political angst and moral melodrama about getting 'the rich' to pay 'their fair share' is part of a big charade. This is not about economics, it is about politics.": "Thomas",

  "I don't know what's more embarrassing, these musicians and actors talking about politics in interviews or the media actually giving them credibility about it. It's absurd that a celebrity could speak out on the economy or politics with no more justification than a hit album or a movie.": "Paul",

  "Economics has become as riveting as politics.": "Tina",
  "Most people who get in trouble in politics usually get in trouble because they're disconnected from the people they serve, and I don't think anybody in Tennessee, even people who won't vote for me, would accuse me of that.": "Lamar",

  "At a purely practical level, history is important because it provides the basic skills needed for students to go further in sociology, politics, international relations and economics. History is also an ideal discipline for almost all careers in the law, the civil service and the private sector.": "Antony",

  "Just by making a decision to stay out of politics, you are making the decision to allow others to shape politics and exert power over you. And if you are alienated from the current political system, then just by staying out of it, if you do nothing to change it, you simply entrench it.": "Joan",

  "The middle ground in Congress has all but disappeared. The founders intended competing principles and interests to check excesses and create a balance in our politics that would benefit 'we the people.'

  "I'm in no way suggesting that my opinion matters more than anyone else's, of course, but the only thing that bothers me is apathy. People that sit out of the process and complain about it, or pretend that politics isn't a part of their everyday lives.": "Olivia",

  "2017 may have been that year when identity politics hit a brick wall - and slumped limply on the pavement.": "Greg",
  "True, the country is divided, but it's not Right and Left. It's Left and Not Left. It is because, for liberals, politics is personal and therefore extremely loud. For the rest of us, we prefer community over calamity.": "Greg",
  "For Americans of the Greatest Generation that fought World War II and of the Silent Generation that came of age in the 1950s, the great moral and ideological cause was the Cold War. It gave purpose and clarity to our politics and foreign policy, and our lives.": "Pat",

  "Power in politics, sovereignty in America is with we the people, and that is the path to turning this country around: empowering the people.": "Ted",
  "There's an old joke that politics is Hollywood for ugly people. An awful lot of the press coverage about Washington reads like coverage of Hollywood. Madonna is having some spat with Sean Penn. Who cares? And who cares which politician is mad at that politician?": "Ted",

  "Alliance - in international politics, the union of two thieves who have their hands so deeply inserted in each other's pockets that they cannot separately plunder a third.": "Ambrose",
  "Politics - I still think it's a bunch of liars and a bunch of self-interest. It's not about the people: it's about themselves and their rise to power.

I don't care what happens.'": "Jay-Z",
  "I never saw anything funnier than Texas politics.": "Molly",

  "When politics is no longer a mission but a profession, politicians become more self-serving than public servants.": "Emmanuel",
  "I think people involved in politics make good actors. Acting and politics both involve fooling people. People like being fooled by actors.

  "I do have a political agenda. It's to have as few regulations as possible.": "Dan",

  "Normally, I stay away from politics - unless I'm going to run for president.": "Grace",
  "If you're sort of interested in politics but sort of upset about contemporary politics, it's kind of wonderful to read about periods who were very eloquent and admirable - generally. People are articulating ideas you can sympathize with or understand both sides of. Or at least feel like one side is saying the right things.": "Whit",
  "One thing that education can do is it can provide us with an opportunity to understand one another better, and so while I've spent a lot of my time in the world of politics, I've always felt that it is really not politics that will solve this for us.": "Condoleezza",

  "When you read about the real history of where feminism comes from, it came from a very political point of view. I don't believe in bringing any politics to an idea like feminism.

  "The 1935 Social Security Act established 65 as the age of eligibility for payouts. But welfare state politics quickly becomes a bidding war, enriching the menu of benefits, so in 1956 Congress entitled women to collect benefits at 62, extending the entitlement to men in 1961.": "George",

  "Have you ever thought how humiliating and distressing it was to be placed upon a sphere? For friendship it is a boon never to be able to be further apart than the antipodes.

  "A traitor is a betrayer - one who practices injury, while professing friendship. Benedict Arnold was a traitor, solely because, while professing friendship for the American cause, he attempted to injure it. An open enemy, however criminal in other respects, is no traitor.": "Lysander",

  "The joys of friendship inert the heart and fizzy home bouncing jubilantly with laughter-buttered love.": "Bradley",

  "Friendship always benefits love sometimes injures.": "Seneca",

That wasn't a friendship when - as, for example, it's me, my friends, we are friends for many years, and it doesn't matter for me what the position is, where they work; we simply are friends.

  "The arrogance that says analysing the relationship between reasons and causes is more important than writing a philosophy of shyness or sadness or friendship drives me nuts. I can't accept that.": "Alain",

  "It is mind-boggling to me that there are so few movies about female friendship, considering women make up half the movie-going population.": "Ari",

  "I firmly believe, only because I've been doing this for so long, every show takes three years. 90% of them don't get three years. It just does.

  "Friendship is something that is cultivated.": "Thalia",

  "There is no sadder sight than a young pessimist.": "Mark",
  "When you're happy you don't always have to be laughing, and when you're sad you don't have to be crying; sometimes it's the opposite. You laugh when you're the most upset.": "Freddie",

  "The tree I had in the garden as a child, my beech tree, I used to climb up there and spend hours. I took my homework up there, my books, I went up there if I was sad, and it just felt very good to be up there among the green leaves and the birds and the sky.": "Jane",

  "I was going to McDonald's and Taco Bell every day. The kids behind the counter knew me - it wouldn't even faze them. Or I'd sit up at Denny's or Big Boy and just eat by myself. It was sad. I got so heavy that people started to not recognize me.": "Eminem",
  "Even modern English people are imperious, superior, ridden by class. All of the hypocrisy and the difficulties that are endemic in being British also make it an incredibly fertile place culturally. A brilliant place to live. Sad but true.": "Pete",

  "I get mad. I get sad. I have all those emotions. But I just like to keep them to myself. I don't think my fans need to be bothered with if I'm mad or sad about something. I should just be concerned that they are keeping up with my music or I'm making them happy with my show.": "Demi",
  "The whole 1950s notion was find the right girl, get married, move to the suburbs and then hang out with the guys while she stayed home with the babies. I felt that was sort of sad.": "Hugh",
  "There are more than 300,000 families in the Gulf region that lost their homes and are waiting for peace of mind. The hurricane exposed the sad reality of poverty in America. We saw, in all its horrific detail, the vulnerabilities of living in inadequate housing and the heartbreak of losing one's home.": "Harry",
  "Musical compositions can be very sad - Chopin - but you have the pleasure of this sadness. The cheap consolation is: you will be happy. The higher consolation is the pleasure and recognition of your unhappiness, the pleasure of having recognised that fate, destiny and life are such as they are and so you reach a higher form of consciousness.": "Umberto",
  "I am an optimist, unrepentant and militant. After all, in order not to be a fool an optimist must know how sad a place the world can be. It is only the pessimist who finds this out anew every day.": "Peter",
  "We don't live in the Garden. We live far from Eden. Every life is full of heartaches. Every life, frankly, is unspeakably sad.": "John",
  "It's important to get well-rounded right off the bat. A lot of experienced dancers can get pigeonholed into one thing.

  "If I could be more vague I'd write more about people in my life, but I hate hurting feelings or making people feel uncomfortable. I've done that before. Unless they're sad songs. Those get finished fast, but the mean ones often end up at the back of the bottom drawer and it's probably for the best.": "Caitlin",
  "These days young kids don't have any place to form an epic adventure. It's more often in front of the TV screen or a laptop. That's very hard on them. They're being taught daily unsocial skills. Facebook is an unsocial skill. It's so sad.": "John",
  "I've always been fascinated by Elizabeth Taylor, and I had read that her first kiss happened on a film set, which actually made me a little sad. You need to have normal experiences of your own.": "Emma",
  "That's what is so great about being able to record a 13-song album. You can do a very eclectic group of songs.

You have your ballads, your happy songs, your sad songs, your love songs, and your feisty songs.": "Reba",
  "There are receptors to these molecules in your immune system, in your gut and in your heart. So when you say, 'I have a gut feeling' or 'my heart is sad' or 'I am bursting with joy,' you're not speaking metaphorically. You're speaking literally.": "Deepak",
  "Creation is a sustained period of bliss, even though the subject can still be very sad. Because there's the triumph of coming through and understanding that you have, and that you did it the way only you could do it. You didn't do it the way somebody told you to do it.": "Alice",
  "I feel that World Cup cricket should be played like football in which all the 160 countries take part. If only a handful of countries are going to keep on playing in the World Cup without making the game popular, I will be a sad man.": "Kapil",
  "I loved being Maleficent. I was quite sad to put my staff down and put my horns away because somehow, she just lives in a different world.": "Angelina",
  "When I go in the studio, I put myself into a place where I'm feeling something I want to portray, which is often being sad, lonely. But as soon as I'm starting to make something, it's when I'm the happiest. Ever. I think that comes out at the same time, so there's that juxtaposition.": "Jamie",

  "Don't eat because you're angry, bored, sad, or stressed.": "John",
  "To be honest, I'm a little upset these days. My family has been exposed to the media. Some people break into our house. My ex-girlfriend's photos are circulating online.

  "When I do see a picture of myself that has been touched up too much, I do get a bit sad... it makes me look like a hypocrite. It breaks my heart. I would rather shoot a magazine and shoot my flaws, but that's not up to me.": "Kendra",
  "It is a historical error for those who were not there to just refer to August 28th as 'I Have a Dream' speech day. That is a real disservice to those who were there. It was a sad day. It was not a celebration environment.": "Jesse",
  "Whenever I start a new book, I think, 'This is the most interesting subject of all time. It's sad, I'll never enjoy writing another book as much as I enjoy this one.' Every time, I'm convinced. And then I change my mind when I start the next book.": "Gretchen",
  "It's kind of sad, the way we've turned the entertainment of reading into a kind of psychic broccoli - something to feel guilty about if you don't force it on your face-making children while dutifully consuming a few token florets yourself.": "Lynn",
  "I like to be sad once in a while. You need it for your equilibrium.": "Marjane",
  "I'm sad, upset, and disheartened with the trolling that happens on social media... At the end of the day, this whole homophobia is so disheartening and upsetting. And then they say, 'Why don't you speak about your sexuality? You could be iconic in this country.' But I don't want to be iconic anywhere. I want to live my life.": "Karan",
  "Of course, you decide which story you want to tell. For me, it's been very authentic, so sometimes I'm super happy, and I post four pictures one after the other; sometimes I'm busy, and I don't. Sometimes I'm sad, and I post a sad picture.": "Chiara",
  "The sad thing about destroying the environment is that we're going to take the rest of life with us. The bluebirds will be gone, and the elephants will be gone, and the tigers will be gone, and the pandas will be gone.": "Ted",

  "I think women should be seductive, not triste. There's enough sadness in life now without making women look sad, too.": "Azzedine",
  "Even if my songs are quite sad or quite dark, I don't want my songs to make people sad. It's very important for me that all my songs have some kind of hope or light.": "Aurora",
  "I'm not sad about any of my life. It's so unconventional. It doesn't look anything like I thought it would.": "Edie",
  "We can't shame women for trying to be beautiful. That's so mean and unfair. But there's a part of me that thinks it's really sad, too. It's very complicated.": "Marilyn",

  "Even today, England is a very repressed, repressive country, and there's pressure to be kind of a certain way, so people do things that ultimately make them sad.": "Ben",
  "With any group of people in life, sad things happen, and crazy things, and happy things. When you're in the public eye, it's just amplified, that's all.": "Margot",
  "What makes me sad about school is that the people who are unhappy are unhappy because they don't believe it will change. And I just want to say: 'It does! High school ends and it's over.' I will tell anyone that it's OK to be unhappy at school, make lots of mistakes and then it will be over.": "Alice",
  "It's the sad thing about entertainment: it's not always about who is the best. Jake The Snake had a horrible time playing politics. I never had a belt; didn't need one. They tried to put me against Hogan twice, but when the people chanted for me, when they chanted for the DDT, that was the end of that. They couldn't ruin their marketing.": "Jake",
  "Corporate tax reform is nice in theory but tough in practice. It most likely requires lower tax rates and the closing of loopholes, which many companies are sure to fight. And whatever new, lower tax rate is determined, there will probably be another country willing to lower its rate further, creating a sad race to zero.": "Andrew",
  "There is no despair so absolute as that which comes with the first moments of our first great sorrow, when we have not yet known what it is to have suffered and be healed, to have despaired and have recovered hope.": "George",

  "I am firmly of the opinion that women who make a lot of effort to hang onto their looks in middle age (unless they are beauties, entertainers or prostitutes) are rather sad, as one should surely have something more substantial to recommend one by this time, such as kindness or cleverness.": "Julie",
  "Our generation, unfortunately, is stuck to our phones - and, like, Twitter - constantly, which I have no problem with.

  "Sometimes I wonder if suicides aren't in fact sad guardians of the meaning of life.": "Vaclav",
  "I was such a sullen, angry, sad kid. I'm sure there are writers who have had happy childhoods, but what are you going to write about? No ghosts, no fear. I'm very happy that I had an unhappy and uncomfortable childhood.": "Isabel",
  "The Christian conceives of his abode on Earth in no more delightful colors than the Jainist sectarian. He sees in it only a time of sad trial he also thinks that his true country is not of this world. ": "Emile",

  "Life will take its toll on all of us. We get injured, we get old. It's really sad to try to run away from these harsh realities of life. Looks are not everything. I am not going to look beautiful all the time.": "Aishwarya",
  "I've seen a couple white girls coming to my concerts wearing head wraps, and I think they look so cute. It's kind of sad to see that people are really into separation, trying to separate everybody and making a clear division of 'us against you,' even with fashion. That sucks.

  "It's hard to watch your life unfold, and sad. Life changes.": "Cilla",

  "It's sad that the cell phone is replacing the watch as a time-telling device. I wear a vintage watch that's really skinny.": "Thom",

  "Falling in love is awesome, but I'm never drawn to happy songs per se, so whenever you sit down to write a heartbreak song and you're happily in love, it's like, 'OK, now I have to go back to a sad place to get something good.'": "Miranda",
  "I had often sought for the peace there is in Christ, but I could not seem to find the freedom I desired. A terrible sadness rested on my heart. I could not think of anything I had done to cause me to feel sad; but it seemed to me that I was not good enough to enter Heaven, that such a thing would be altogether too much for me to expect.": "Ellen",
  "From inside where I live, I feel like I just perceive events in a certain rational way. I often find it sad or poignant, and it may not make me laugh a bit. But I don't mind inventing a portrait that allows others to laugh if that's what they want to do.": "Madeline",
  "It's sad that some people who have one exciting moment spend the rest of their lives rehashing it.": "Jonathan",

It saved the myth that if the Soviets were not to intervene, there would have been some flowering authentic democratic socialism and so on. I'm a little bit more of a pessimist there.

  "My experience, with both my parents, is that grief has a lot of down, sad things, but I was also really emotionally raw, in the first year after each of them passed. Flowers smelled more intensely, my relationships were hotter, and I was more willing to risk. I was going for it a lot more. I was 'unsober' and I wasn't playing by my rules.": "Mike",
  "I think I'm probably a very sad man wrapped in a very joyful package, and I think I'm very resilient, and I think I'm quite generous, sometimes to a fault. And I'm very bad with money, but I don't see that too much of a flaw.": "Dave",

  "I grew up feeling 'less than.' I was the sad, shy child hiding in the hall closet beneath coats. I'd wait for my grandmother's voice to call, 'Jewell, Jewell.' I was lost, waiting to be found.

  "I always think of the live show first, where the song is gonna go in the show. That's why they aren't sad songs. When I play, I want to make people happy, not sad. It's such a pleasure for me to do what I do, and I want other people to feel some form of that pleasure, too.": "Jason",
  "I don't ever want to be sad about my life.": "Tammy",

And both he and I became truck drivers for different companies.": "Frank",
  "One of the things psychologists used to say was that if you are depressed, anxious or angry, you couldn't be happy. Those were at opposite ends of a continuum. I believe that you can be suffering or have a mental illness and be happy - just not in the same moment that you're sad.": "Martin",
  "What I find sad is that the New Age movement is primarily a commercial undertaking. But it is answering to a human need.": "Laura",

  "If some people try to make a prenup into a pre-negotiation of a divorce... Well, that's really sad. But I do think that it's important to understand what each person has coming into the relationship, and what each person expects from the relationship. They aren't always fun discussions to have, and they can be very eye-opening.": "Laura",
  "I want my clothes to have a life and then end up in a secondhand store, where some cool girl discovers them 20 years later. If the runway or red carpet is the only life clothes have, it's sad.": "Jeremy",
  "I think I drift toward sad love songs.": "Benmont",
  "But I'm not like sad, depressed miserable person. I guess sometimes I give off that impression.": "Edward",

  "When I was growing up, albums were my closest friends, as sad as that may sound - Joy Division's 'Closer,' or Echo and the Bunnymen's 'Heaven Up Here'... I had a more intimate relationship with those records than I did with most of the people in my life.": "Moby",

  "People say you should read your criticism because it will make you a better person but it doesn't. It just makes you a sad bitter old showbiz nightmare.": "Jo",

  "I think Jerry Lee is sad. As a musician, he was far more talented than Elvis Presley. Everybody down in Memphis knows that. Elvis became a movie star because he was beautiful. Not that Elvis wasn't talented, but Jerry Lee Lewis was incomprehensibly talented as a musician.": "Alec",
  "It is a sad but undeniable reality that people have died in the line of duty since the earliest days of the United Nations.

  "Ten years ago, I still feared loss enough to abandon myself in order to keep things stable. I'd smile when I was sad, pretend to like people who appalled me.

  "Having read my share of tell-alls over the year, including some that were passed off as autobiographies, I mostly feel sad - sometimes for the writer and sometimes for all the people in his way.

  "I get kind of sad when I look at all of my magazines and think about how at one time I was much more impressed with a certain fashion editorial, or how I feel like I can't really relate to being that excited about fashion anymore. Maybe it's being jaded, but I honestly like that now, when something's really good, I feel more affected by it.": "Tavi",
  "I think that when you make yourself vulnerable, the thing that you do next is better. It's not like you have to inflict pain on yourself in order to make yourself better, but I think it helps. The thing that bonds you to a new friend isn't that you went to a really fun party; it's 'cause you had a really weird, sad conversation.": "Tavi",
  "Homeless people really upset me when I was little. A lot of kids have this reaction, but I would get really worried or sad or concerned or cry.": "Paul",

  "Sad people dislike the happy, and the happy the sad; the quick thinking the sedate, and the careless the busy and industrious.": "Horace",
  "I'm sad to see celluloid go, there's no doubt. But, you know, nitrate went, by the way, in 1971. If you ever saw a nitrate print of a silent film and then saw an acetate print, you'd see a big difference, but nobody remembers anymore. The acetate print is what we have. Maybe. Now it's digital.": "Martin",

  "Fear of carbs, of gluten, of everything - we've distanced ourselves from the beauty of food, the art of it. It makes me sad when people say, 'Oh, I don't eat gluten. I don't eat cheese. I don't eat this. So I eat cardboard.'": "Olivia",
  "All pictures are unnatural. All pictures are sad because they're about dead people. Paintings you don't think of in a special time or with a specific event. With photos I always think I'm looking at something dead.": "David",
  "So few people read poetry. That's sad, isn't it?": "Jerry",
  "My thing with fans is, it's always about being really good to them and taking the time to take every picture. If there are 300 people, you should take 300 pictures - you shouldn't take 250 because then fifty people will go home sad. Why would you do that?": "Ansel",
  "It's sad how people want to see us females go against each other. Never been for that. Never will.": "Ciara",

  "I'm always sad to see a relationship not work, but what happens between two people is not my business.": "Debbie",
  "People tend to put entertainers on pedestals. We're human beings, just like you. You may see us smiling, and whether we have money or not, we still have bills to pay, we still have our stresses. I think a lot of people want to focus on others' shortcomings to make themselves feel better. And it's a very sad thing.": "Janet",

  "When I seemed to be irritable or sad, my father would quote the learned Dr. Knight, and then say, 'Just go to sleep.' Like all smart aleck kids, I thought the advice was silly. But as I've grown older, I've realized just how smart Knight was.": "Ben",
  "The sad fact is that spending rises every year, no matter what people want or say they want.": "Ben",
  "Scientists habitually moan that the public doesn't understand them. But they complain too much: public ignorance isn't peculiar to science. It's sad if some citizens can't tell a proton from a protein. But it's equally sad if they're ignorant of their nation's history, can't speak a second language, or can't find Venezuela or Syria on a map.": "Martin",
  "It's hard to tell what an entire series is going to be based on the first few episodes, or even on the first season. And it's sad because you see great casts and good ideas that don't get that opportunity to grow and show what it could turn into.": "Kaley",
  "When I went to college, my mum was really sad, so she preserved my bedroom, like a weird time capsule.": "Gia",
  "I love the romcom. I thought I had a career playing the best friend. What happened to that? It's really sad to me.": "Parker",
  "The sad fact is that actual artistic oppression - book banning in its many modern forms - is a matter of course in the entertainment industry, especially when the underlying product is declared politically incorrect or runs contrary to the interests of Hollywood's political altar, the Democratic Party.": "Andrew",
  "Western governments have generally tried to contain genocide by appeasing its architects. But the sad record of the last century shows that the walls the United States tries to build around genocidal societies almost inevitably shatter.": "Samantha",
  "Of course it's true: the public want to see young people - young people are the people who go to the cinema. It's a sad fact of life, but you've got to accept it and not whine about it.": "Joan",
  "We're sad about some of the losses of members of great seniority and distinction in the Congress, and some very new members, who will no longer be serving with us.": "Nancy",
  "I try to make an album that reflects what I love about country music. It's not just all about happy parties all the time. There are some sad songs.": "Dierks",
  "I'm part of the party, getting the crowd fired up, singing songs, pouring drinks, whatever it takes to get them to have a good time. When I walk into the meet-and-greet, someone's always going to have a story, a sad story or a happy story.": "Dierks",
  "A very sad moment for me was when my parents separated - a lot of crying, 'It's tragic, we're now a broken family, blah blah blah blah blah' - although my psychological problems stopped. I actually felt healthier.": "Whit",
  "I have learned so much from India: for instance, the use of aloe vera, which I use, and I find it sad when I see certain arts of oiling slowly fading away.": "Nargis",
  "It's a sad day when Republicans will attack fellow Republicans on an issue as fundamental as free enterprise.": "Doug",
  "Tony Benn and I were very close, very close friends for 30, 40 years. We talked to each other a great deal, and we were great friends. And I was with him shortly before he died, talking about prospects of the world and prospects for peace. And I'm very sad that he's gone.": "Jeremy",
  "That's why I've always loved country music. Whether it's sad, pumps you up, or it's breakup songs, it's all real-life things.": "Cole",
  "I love 'The Sportswriter' by Richard Ford. Ford really captures for me the bittersweetness of the quietly suffering American man. It's stoic, sad, and really beautiful.": "Mark",
  "I always thought it was sad that you couldn't get anything really good to eat at concerts, so we sit down with our fans before every show and eat a gourmet meal that we made for them.": "Zac",
  "It does make me sad that there's a lot of great songs out there, and they're not going to see the light of day because they're competing with these tailgate songs.": "Zac",
  "I don't consider myself a celebrity. That would be kind of sad.": "Adam",
  "It makes me very sad. Everyone's afraid of each other - Jews are afraid of Palestinians, Palestinians are afraid of Jews. Everywhere I see fear, not understanding. Reason went out of the window a long time ago.": "Miriam",
  "The rise of the iPod meant that digital music became the norm, It's sad, but you can still find the real stuff out there if you look for it!": "Peter",
  "Sad to say, negative advertising really works.": "Jerry",
  "It's sad to be constantly judged for every move you make after your first success. If you wear your hair differently, you have changed.": "Kriti",
  "Metal isn't necessarily aggressive. There's metal that's contemplative, there's metal that's sad, and there's metal that's exuberant. No genre is limited in what it can express.": "John",
  "It looks like I'm just gonna keep getting really, really happy and sad and embarrassed and excited and disappointed for the rest of my life, so let's just do that.": "Jenny",
  "Sad to say, multi-tasking is beyond me. I read one book at a time all the way through. If I'm reviewing the book, I have to write the review before I start reading any other book. I especially hate it when the phone rings and interrupts my train of thought.": "Michael",
  "Nothing gets on other people's nerves at the office more than a whistler. And the sad part is, these whistlers don't know they're doing it. Someone should, tactfully, tell the whistler how much it disrupts the office environment.": "Letitia",
  "Watching an entrepreneur fail is sad, but watching him fail from lack of nerve is tragic.": "Steve",
  "The sad thing is that I feel so boring because 'Twilight' is literally how every conversation I have these days begins - whether it's someone I'm meeting for the first time or someone I just haven't seen in a while. The first thing I want to say to them is, 'It's insane! And, as a person, I can't do anything!'": "Kristen",
  "I don't want to see myself as this sad, disabled girl. I know that. I don't want other people to see me as that, either.": "Amy",
  "Los Angeles can be a really sad city.": "Adam",
  "No matter how old and glorious the models, sad indeed is the woman who sees fashion as a means of self-expression rather than an agent of social control.": "Julie",
  "I didn't end up some sad, tragic guy singing in a lounge somewhere. I never went out and took big money for nostalgia and became like an oldies act.": "David",
  "Most of the time, we keep looking outside and feeling sad about what others have. Those are mere excuses.": "Yami",
  "It would be a sad story to get rid of religious belief, national identity, family, and even sexual identity. That's not freedom.": "Viktor",
  "I live on a train. I know - what a sad thing to admit. I am the New-Age Willy Loman. But there it is.": "Christopher",
  "I was friends with Susan Sontag the last four years of her life. She had this amazing charisma and so much energy, but she had a sad little funeral in Montparnasse in Paris. It was rainy. It was all wrong. And I was thinking, 'God, she loved life so much.'": "Marina",

  "I love curves; I'm all about curves. I don't have many, which is really sad, but I think the more the better.": "Cara",
  "I was quite solitary for 'Hitman.' I was quite apart. He struck me as a very sad individual. There was a mournful quality there.": "Rupert",

  "It was a sad process for me to become a mom, and a long process. I felt so embarrassed that I couldn't have a biological child.": "Nia",
  "A lot of sad stories in a row - that wears on you.": "Elizabeth",
  "I am pretty weird - as weird as in my videos. The only difference is Lilly is not a performer, and Superwoman is. So Superwoman is very fearless. You'll never see her nervous. You'll never see her sad. But Lilly is a human. She is the person behind Superwoman, who gets sad and tired sometimes.": "Lilly",
  "You know, the sad thing of post-9/11, which was of course horrific, was that the city in which I felt completely at home for two decades, suddenly people like us - brown people - were looked at as the 'Others.'": "Mira",
  "I know that there is a great diversity of opinion as to who, in fact, pays the duties on imports. I do not intend to discuss that point. We of the staple and exporting States have long settled the question for ourselves, almost unanimously, from sad experience.": "John",
  "It has been lately urged in a very respectable quarter that it is the mission of this country to spread civil and religious liberty all over the globe, and especially over this continent - even by force, if necessary. It is a sad delusion.": "John",
  "It's really easy to do sad you just put on some sad music and write dramatically - everybody can do that.": "Jill",
  "It's a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.": "W.",
  "It is a sad fact about our culture that a poet can earn much more money writing or talking about his art than he can by practicing it.": "W.",
  "There are consequences with age, so you have to evolve. I've loved becoming a filmmaker. But I would love to continue modeling, and there isn't really any job for me. It's being marginalized - that's the sad part.": "Isabella",
  "I was sad that Corpse Bride was so short. I would've liked to have had her around for way longer. She doesn't actually have that many scenes.": "Helena",
  "I love sad songs. They say so much. I love country music but even the happy songs sound really sad.": "Beth",
  "If you're going to do a thing, do it fully so that no writing you give the world misrepresents you - so that nothing you put out there is like a sad regift you couldn't throw away and had to find a place for.": "Lydia",
  "The sad fact is that it would be fair to say that United is a generic, bureaucratic, tired company. A sort of DMV in the sky. No real culture. No real strategy. No real expectations for employees or customers. All of which is a shame.": "Patrick",
  "I certainly feel sad about the alienation from my son.": "Harold",
  "I've cooked plenty of meals when I was sad, lonely, depressed, angry, bored, and/or under the weather. My primary aim in these circumstances is generally to cheer myself up, to fill my stomach with something warm so I can feel comforted and fed, usually just with a quick soup or an omelet.": "Kate",
  "Eating by myself in my own apartment, single and alone again for the first time in many years, I should have felt, but did not feel, sad. Because I had taken the trouble to make myself a real dinner, I felt nurtured and cared for, if only by myself. Eating alone was freeing, too; I didn't have to make conversation.": "Kate",
  "I've got to be high class... Which is sad, because I like bars.": "Daniel",
  "I'm a sucker for sad disco pop.": "Sophie",
  "You mustn't smile when you lose. You have to be sad like other people. You have to win every game.": "Eden",
  "There's never been a culture that wasn't obsessed with food. The sort of sad thing is that our obsession is no longer with food, but with the price of food.": "Jonathan",
  "When people ask if I'm going to be sad that 'The Office' is over, they don't even understand the depth of that question for me. It's an era of my life. No one would have known my name if it wasn't for the show.": "John",
  "It doesn't hurt to feel sad from time to time.": "Willie",
  "Well the country songs themselves are three-chord stories, ballads which are mostly sad. If you are already feeling sorry for yourself when you listen to them they will take you to an even sadder place.": "Willie",
  "A lot of country music is sad. I think most art comes out of poverty and hard times. It applies to music. Three chords and the truth - that's what a country song is. There is a lot of heartache in the world.": "Willie",
  "I'm convinced I got signed because of who I am. And it makes me sad.": "Jeff",
  "I'm convinced part of the reason I got signed is because of who I am, and it makes me sad.": "Jeff",
  "'The Killing' has a really great combination of qualities: Even though it's very sad and deals with mourning and grief, it's still exciting. It's about real people and it doesn't shy from the painful points of life.": "Joel",
  "You get people who come to London, sever links with where they come from, and then when they need people, there's nobody there. To feel like you can't go back home would be a horribly sad place to be, as is mistaking fame for genuine love and affection.": "Johnny",
  "I don't have any problem with being the guy whose album people put on when they're feeling sad.": "Sam",
  "The first thing many tourists see in Hawaii is concrete - a long dreary stretch of it through landscapes dominated by sad, cheap apartment buildings and almost entirely denuded of plant life.": "Hanya",
  "Ninety percent of people who lose weight gain it back. It's very sad.": "Richard",
  "The sad truth for American actors is that they really have no control whatsoever over the material that they get, or can do, particularly actresses. And if you're over 40 and you're an actress, forget it.": "James",
  "I actually get quite sad when I smell bacon.": "Jane",
  "I can't watch my first audition because it makes me too upset. I just think it is really sad. I look at myself and don't recognize myself. I do think fame and fortune changes people.": "Rebecca",
  "It's sad really, I think 'Freedom' would've done better, but it got shelved because of the pregnancy, so it might be something that might get revisited in the future; who knows?": "Rebecca",
  "Women's bodies are amazing; what our bodies can do is incredible, so it's sad that we get distracted - all this stuff about being skinny, be this, be that - they're all distractions.": "Rebecca",
  "Nixon has enough to overcome in terms of his legacy and his political history. Now he has to overcome the in-fighting between his daughters. It's so sad. There's another obstacle for him to clear.": "Monica",
  "Everything comes from your mind. You have to push yourself to get things going in your direction. If you are stubborn, nothing will help. If you are sad, nothing will help. You have to keep positive and to work very well for your next chance.": "Henrikh",
  "Even when I wasn't playing, I always had a smile on my face because if I acted sad or mad, it wouldn't help me.": "Henrikh",
  "The funny thing is I'm not bothered or sad about being on my own - after all I've never had a husband.": "Francesca",
  "I'm not bothered or sad about being on my own - after all, I've never had a husband.": "Francesca",
  "I've always been very supported. I've never really been sad. I've just been broke. They are very different things.": "Daveed",
  "I'm sad that it's uncool or offensive to talk about environmental or human rights issues.": "Grimes",
  "It's sad that people will invade someone's privacy - and this is not only regarding someone's private photos - but this goes deep into people's financial privacy, their passwords, their emails, their text messages.": "Yvonne",
  "I'm not a singer. In 'Bye Bye Birdie,' I think I was the sad girl who sits on the park bench during 'Put on a Happy Face.'": "Yvonne",
  "The best quality about Kobe Bryant? You want me to be honest? I don't know. I'll tell you why. I open my arms to everybody. But he never stepped forward for the embrace. So I never really got to know him. I don't know anything about him, and it's kinda sad.": "Shaquille",
  "There's a rule of writing: if everything is funny, nothing is funny; if everything is sad, nothing is sad. You want that contrast.": "J.",
  "Like many of my friends in the Pakistani diaspora - and many of my friends in Pakistan itself, for that matter - I have sometimes looked at the country of my birth and wondered whether its future will be one of steady and sad decline.": "Mohsin",
  "Yes's whole career was never really planned in any sort of way. It's always sad when a member leaves, but it's exciting when someone new comes in, and that regenerates the freshness of the band.": "Chris",
  "I think actually it's kind of sad because something I looked forward to just getting to the NFL growing up was just being able to have more fun, the rules loosen up, being able to celebrate.": "Ezekiel",
  "I don't think of my songs as sad songs. I think of them as vulnerable and honest. I crack jokes in between songs, so people don't leave feeling too dark.": "Mary",
  "I've never thought of my characters as being sad. On the contrary, they are full of life. They didn't choose tragedy. Tragedy chose them.": "Juliette",
  "I started balding at age 17 and after first being sad, I really embraced it.": "Jason",
  "We never taste a perfect joy our happiest successes are mixed with sadness.": "Pierre",
  "I was told so many times when I was a kid, 'I can't be friends with you, you're too intense, you're too sad all the time.' I really thought that when I made the first album that everyone would understand me, all the people who weren't my friends would become my friends.": "Fiona",
  "'Lord of the Rings' was my jam. I was so depressed when I realized that I couldn't live in Middle-earth. And I was so sad when I was eleven and didn't get a letter from Hogwarts saying that I was going to be a wizard!": "Lucas",
  "Everyone finds my work super sad. I never do. I always find it uplifting in a weird way.": "Jeff",
  "It's sad to see these old buildings go because they have so many memories, and it's a real personal kind of thing when you play these places. It's part of our history just gone.": "Clarence",
  "It would be a sad day if we British stopped being cynical, but you sometimes wonder whether we overdo it.": "Boris",
  "It's very rare that things are true about yourself that are on the Internet. It's just sad sometimes. So you definitely try and stay away from it as much as possible.": "Taylor",
  "You're playing a role, but you're still feeling it. You can walk away from it after 'Cut,' but if you're playing a sad or mixed-up person, it's hard to stay in that place for these longish period of times. You kind of have to check out.": "Nick",
  "Alison Carr on 'Homeland.' She was such great character to play, so clever and full of surprises. I was sad to see her go.": "Miranda",
  "I'm not sad at all about turning 40.": "Halle",
  "I think I would be very sad if I wasn't able to have a baby.": "Nicole",
  "I've had some pretty good arguments with people, but I've never regretted it. I've had people come up where it's all emotion and no fact. That's always sad.": "Patton",
  "Wearing a tuxedo isn't as simple as it sounds. I've been to a lot of award shows in Hollywood over the years and have seen some pretty sad tuxes. It's surprisingly easy to go off the rails.": "Paul",
  "What I think is funny is when people, despite tragic situations, are still hopeful, still trying. It's sweet and sad - and, to me, hilarious.": "Casey",
  "The sad thing about any business I suppose, but in mine you see it particularly, is that you're always asked to do what you've already done.": "Jeremy",
  "What I really tried to do with Helen was make her show this sad side of her. She was married off at 16, was so young and living in this castle that can't leave because of how she looks, and married to a man she hates and three times her age.": "Diane",
  "Stories have always been the things that entertain me and make me feel happy and sad and move me and give me the experience of being able to live many lives in one lifetime. It's the best thing about being alive.": "Michael",
  "For a culture that has such a problem with death, we seem to deal with it in a quite bizarre way. We see people shot, killed and blown up, and we find it funny and sexy and all those things. But, the reality of it is that every day people die, and people are really sad and they grieve and they go through a really difficult process with it.": "Michael",
  "The sad thing is most people have to check with someone before they do the things that make them happy. We're all passing through; the least we can do is be happy, and the only way to do that is by being selfish.": "Gene",
  "I'm the only one in my family who is deaf, and there are still conversations that go around me that I miss out on. And I ask what's going on, and I have to ask to be included. But I'm not going to be sad about it. I don't live in sad isolation. It's just a situation I'm used to.": "Marlee",
  "I would love to be married. But it's not a necessity like the way that I feel I need and want to have children. It would be wonderful to have a husband, and I would feel blessed to do it. But I would feel sad for the rest of my life if I had no kids.": "Mindy",
  "I write entirely in English; Tagalog chauvinists chide me for this. I feel no guilt in doing so. But I am sad that I cannot write in my native Ilokano. History demanded this; if it isn't English I am using now, I would most probably be writing in Spanish like Rizal, or even German or Japanese.": "F.",
  "You can't have an up without a down, a right without a left, a back without a front - or a happy without a sad.": "Harlan",
  "Being single is only sad if you have a problem with your own company. I'm content with mine.": "Olga",
  "I'm always sad when Dad doesn't like my columns. He waits for them every week and usually likes them, in which case he doesn't say a word - it's only if he's critical that he bothers to call.": "Sayed",
  "I've never met a woman who thinks they've got a good enough figure - however perfect they look - which is sad, because no one else can see these perceived flaws; they're entirely internal.": "L'Wren",
  "It is one of the most saddening things in life that, try as we may, we can never be certain of making people happy, whereas we can almost always be certain of making them unhappy.": "Thomas",
  "I love jazz music and sad music. I'm a sentimental guy. I'm a romantic guy.": "Fred",
  "In my kids' school, the married family is an anomaly... which I do think is sad. I do believe in marriage.": "Marcia",
  "I'm so glad I spent 10 years being sad and lonely.": "Caitlin",
  "It's sad that grandkids show up at the end of obituaries, way behind the list of work place achievements, social clubs and survivors. Why last? If you've got grandkids, you know they're first when it comes to the joy in your life.": "Regina",
  "I'm sad I'm not in 'The Purge 2.'": "Lena",
  "A lot of my movies have come to be thought about only years after the fact, and I'm sad about that but also happy about it in a way, as it's given them longevity.": "Nicolas",
  "I survived turning 60, I was not thrilled to turn 61, I was less thrilled to turn 62, I didn't much like being 63, I loathed being 64, and I will hate being 65. I don't let on about such things in person; in person, I am cheerful and Pollyanna-ish. But the honest truth is that it's sad to be over 60.": "Nora",
  "Atari is a very sad story.": "Steve",
  "I always feel sad when I come to the end of a book.": "Claire",
  "You know, why at the end of your life should you assemble thousands of pages of 'Why am I so sad, why am I so depressed?' Instead, assemble thousands of pages of why you're so content.": "Elizabeth",
  "Saturdays and Sundays, America in the year 2009 does not in some ways differ significantly from the country that existed almost 50 years ago. This is truly sad.": "Eric",
  "There are things you're supposed to learn in life. My biggest regret was terminating a pregnancy when I was about 18. Every day, I think about who that baby would be now; it still makes me sad.": "Suzi",
  "The big thing for me is to make films that you feel, whether you feel happy, whether you feel sad, whether you feel sick; it's to make the audience feel so that the next day they remember what they saw.": "Asif",
  "You have to really understand that although certain memories or stories make you sad, you are not sad. Pull yourself out from that emotion and remember that.": "Rupi",
  "It's a sad fact that a lot of those countries who haven't been involved in the war in Iraq have taken far more responsibility for rehoming people displaced by the war than Britain has done.": "Romola",
  "My solo album is dead and buried. We had the funeral. It was sad and I cried a lot but it made such a beautiful corpse that we had an open casket.": "Shirley",
  "There is something sad about malevolence, to be wicked. I have always tried to make that come across in the villains I have played.": "Christopher",
  "The attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon shook our nation to the core. Americans were deeply frightened, sad, and angry, and they rallied around a President who, at the time, showed impressive certitude and calm.": "Eliot",
  "With my schedule being so crazy, I can't call every day or hang out with my friends like I used to and that's definitely sad.": "Jordin",
  "I love books; my suitcases are always full of them. Books and shoes. I read when I am sad, when I am happy, when I am nervous. My favourite British author is Jane Austen, and my favourite American one is John O'Hara.": "Carolina",
  "We all suffer in our own way; like, life is miserable. And I'm not, 'Oh, I'm a stand-up who's sad,' but the reality is that just about everyone is quietly unhappy. I don't think that pertains to comedians specifically. I think most people look at themselves in the mirror and are not happy with what they see.": "Nick",
  "I find Spike Jones' movies to be really very inventive and funny, but they're really sad and touching and really key into the different facets of the human experience.": "Nick",
  "Love Is Louder is a movement that is hopefully going to bring some awareness and make some noise when it comes to teens who are feeling suicidal or even just sad, outcasts, and being bullied, and really feel like they have nowhere to turn to.": "Brittany",
  "When I remember my mother, it makes me really sad. But, when I remember my father, it makes me smile.": "Akkineni",
  "Hollywood is like a really sad, grown up version of high school where people get labeled as 'cool,' 'not cool,' 'jock,' 'bombshell,' 'quirky'... it's like a caste system. You're either in, or you're out.": "Zoe",
  "You have to keep hobbies in L.A. Otherwise, it's sad.": "Lake",
  "What I think is sad about the rom-com genre is that it has adopted this pejorative title. I think the reason why there haven't been as many great ones is because we are fighting against the genre itself. If it is a romantic comedy then snuggle up to the fact that it can be a really earnest, refreshing feeling to feel good after a movie.": "Lake",
  "I never get scared making these kinds of movies because it's all make-believe, but I did cry when I saw the finished version of Man On Fire because it is so sad.": "Dakota",
  "The hardest thing is at the end you have to say bye to all these people who you have worked with for so many months. It was really sad not to see them anymore. But you have the parties that you go to and you get to see them, like the premieres and the screenings.": "Dakota",
  "I like everything perfect. Everything has to be neat. My sister is 5, and she's more messy than I am. I make my bed every morning, everything's perfect. My shoes are all arranged. It's sad. I'm a little like Ray, a little bit.": "Dakota",
  "I grew up thinking that it's okay to be sad, angry, and express your emotions. I have also banged doors and fought, as I have seen my mom do that when she would fight with my dad. Everything that I've learnt is from them, so I've never struggled to express myself.": "Alia",
  "I don't know who would not classify themselves as a romantic. I think that would be sort of sad.": "Natalie",
  "I'm very artistic and creative, disorganised - ambitious, I would say, if that even makes sense. I'm definitely not the most mathematical person in the world; not scientific. I can't even work out a tip; it's really sad. But I've always thought, play up your strengths and let someone else handle your weaknesses. It's OK. Work together.": "Whitney",
  "I know a lot of sad people who aren't comedians.": "Gene",
  "I allow myself to not feel the need to be some sort of wonder woman. You can't do everything at once and tear your hair out when you miss your baby using a potty for the first time, although my son was obviously very sad that his mum was not there on his big day.": "Catherine",
  "I don't really do sad, depressing songs.": "Olly",
  "If people are paying money to see me, then I want them to walk away from the show knowing they had a really great time. I want it to be very energetic and to have fun, sad, emotional and uplifting moments. I want it to have everything!": "Olly",
  "I'm not going to do a song that's really sad and thoughtful. Although I've done ballads like 'Dear Darlin',' I want to make them dance and be happy.": "Olly",
  "I've always been drawn to Marilyn Monroe, but certain aspects of her story may be too sad to tell.": "Sherilyn",
  "I've worked with some people that just spent hours and hours and hours in the mirror, and just so much importance is based on that. And I do find that sad.": "Sherilyn",
  "For whatever reason, the films I gravitate towards do have these strange sort of tonal balances to them... I kind of realized on '50/ 50' why I liked these blending of tones, because I think it's kind of what life is like: funny one minute, sad the next, scary the next.": "Jonathan",
  "I am very sad that some designers are still using real fur when the fake alternatives are so effective and so easily obtainable.": "Twiggy",
  "I was at the Olympic Games winning medals and I still doubted my image. I doubted what I looked like. That's sad.": "Shawn",
  "I find it amusing on one level, poignant on another, when people try to get recognition from an outside source. It's sad.": "Grace",

  "Chocolate is the go-to ingredient for many people. It is the thing people crave when they are happy and celebrate it is also the go-to ingredient for many people when we are sad or depressed. It makes us feel better. ": "Johnny",
  "I probably never would have been hired on Broadway had I not moved out to L.A. and pursued acting and film, which is sad, really.": "Amy",
  "I was very sad to hear of the death of Ronnie Barker, who was such a warm, friendly and encouraging presence to have when I started in television. He was also a great comic actor to learn from.": "John",
  "I am an optimist, and I try to think that the light will always prevail in any situation, so it doesn't really make me sad about humanity because I think, deep down, everybody is full of love and light.": "Thomas",
  "My dad was a homicide cop in the gay neighborhood in the city when gay neighborhoods were desperate, depressing, sad places run by the mob. The only gay people he'd met when I came out to him were corpses.": "Dan",
  "But you see, that's the gilded prison of fashion. We're riding in private jets, and meantime I was so incredibly, painfully sad and lonely.": "Janice",
  "I guess it's sad that anybody, regardless of profession, that they're in this country, would take a shot at our military.": "Jeff",
  "You start to fall in love with characters as you work with them, and anytime that you care about your characters and you realize that you're gonna have to kill them, that fear creeps in. It's sad. It's scary, and it's also sad. Because you like these people.": "Drew",
  "My father's death, my move, and my frightening and difficult delivery created a tremendous amount of stress, pain, and sadness for me. I was practically devastated beyond recovery.": "Brooke",
  "As a writer, or as a filmmaker, you have to present yourself, and part of what yourself is is what you're interested in, or what you think is funny, or what you think is sad, or what you think is horrible.": "Charlie",
  "I've met so many fans of daytime television who've watched the shows with their moms and grandmas and feel like they've known the characters their whole lives. It's sad for them to have to say goodbye to their favorite soaps and characters. We don't want that to happen to the 'Days' fans.": "Alison",
  "Nobody wants to hear R&B. It's sad. If you want to be on the radio you got to stay young.": "Jamie",
  "It feels really sad, to me, to go to a dark bedroom. It's like surrendering to the night or something.": "James",
  "The 2012 presidential campaign's turn away from the classic, straight-up, American election - where the candidate who gets the most votes nationwide wins - is another sad reminder of the extreme political polarization distorting today's politics. No one talks about a 50-state strategy for winning the presidency these days.": "Juan",
  "So many schools are getting rid of music programs and it's really sad because I know that when I started singing and stuff it was something that I always wanted to do and I never believed in myself to be able to do it.": "Hilary",
  "Marketing has supplanted story as the primary force behind the worthiness of making a film, and that's a very sad thing. It's film only as a function of consumerism rather than as an important component of our culture, and that's everywhere around the world.": "Alexander",
  "If you're sad about what you see in the mirror when you wake up every morning, you must change it.": "Azzedine",
  "Nobody destroys people - people destroy themselves, and it's very, very sad.": "John",
  "A sad person who is so involved with his sadness that he mistakes it for reality will have a hard time seeing himself as anything but sad. For him, the sadness is not a feeling that he experiences - it is him.": "Mary",
  "It's sad to think right now, but probably the Russian and Chinese government know more about Hillary Clinton's e-mail server than do the members of the United States Congress. And - and that has put our national security at risk.": "Scott",
  "I think my thing is that... I don't know. And that's why I don't wanna sing about 'This is me, this is who I am' because, like, even the question, 'Tell me about yourself' - what are you supposed to say? 'Ooh, I'm a happy girl, but I'm sad, too'? People are so complex.": "Zara",
  "It's incredible that they censor films. It's sad.": "Dario",
  "For a long time, censors have been cutting my works. This makes me so sad, because many times they will tell me, 'Television won't like, so we have to cut, cut, cut!'": "Dario",
  "I have nothing against younger women and older men on screen. What is sad is that so many women over 40 who have so much to give aren't being considered to play opposite men their own age or younger.": "Rene",
  "I think that's very sad, that I haven't allowed my heart to be broken. I have broken a few.": "Sally",
  "I've never had my heart broken. It's a very sad state of affairs. I think everybody should have their heart broken. I don't think it says anything good about me at all.": "Sally",
  "Dwight is a sad clown. You've seen those paintings of sad clown.": "Rainn",
  "I enjoy being recognized. I'll be very sad if people stop recognizing me. I'll be very sad if I'm not interviewed, because that's a very amazing process.": "Anupam",
  "It's sad when people break up.": "Pete",
  "Women get the attention when we get into the men's arena, and that's sad.": "Billie",

  "The Indian Summer of life should be a little sunny and a little sad, like the season, and infinite in wealth and depth of tone, but never hustled.": "Henry",
  "I think as an American society, when we're paying too many taxes or dealing with war, we don't want to see sad things at the movies.": "Zoe",
  "I think everyone feels alone in their sadness, and there's a certain value to hearing other people's sad stories.": "Brandon",
  "It is a sad day for our country when the moral foundation of our law and the acknowledgment of God has to be hidden from public view to appease a federal judge.": "Soledad",
  "Women are reputed never to be disgusted. The sad fact is that they often are, but not with men; following the lead of men, they are most often disgusted with themselves.": "Germaine",
  "I got interested in reading very early, because a story was read to me, by Hans Christian Andersen, which was 'The Little Mermaid,' and I don't know if you remember 'The Little Mermaid,' but it's dreadfully sad. The little mermaid falls in love with this prince, but she cannot marry him because she is a mermaid.": "Alice",
  "The history of soccer is a sad voyage from beauty to duty. When the sport became an industry, the beauty that blossoms from the joy of play got torn out by its very roots.": "Eduardo",
  "It makes me sad there is still some intellectual snobbery out there.": "Steve",
  "Death makes us sad, but it can also make us feel more alive.": "Sally",
  "I was sad to see anybody leave, we had a very nice family on that show. I was very sad to see momma go, Victoria and especially Linda. My god that was my wife on the show, in fact my wife calls her wife.": "Larry",
  "Listeners instinctively detect that when we lower the usual pitch of our voice, we are sad, and when we raise it, we are angry or fearful.": "Leonard",
  "It's so sad to see how few people in the Obama administration have any private sector experience.": "Foster",
  "This is going to sound really sad, but I didn't really have any heartthrobs when I was growing up. I was a bit of a geek.": "Gugu",
  "When you're going through something, whether it's a wonderful thing like having a child or a sad thing like losing somebody, you often feel like 'Oh my God, I'm so overwhelmed; I'm dealing with this huge thing on my own.' In fact, poetry's a nice reminder that, no, everybody goes through it. These are universal experiences.": "Caroline",
  "We've got people looking at our seamy side and our sad side a lot of the time because that's easier. It's much more difficult to make a film about happiness with lots of jokes in it.": "Emma",
  "I always knew that St. Jude was an amazing organization but meeting the kids and seeing how the hospital works first hand was truly beautiful. It doesn't feel like a regular hospital all dreary and sad. It's a colorful, beautiful, comfortable, fun place to live and the energy is wonderful.": "Ariana",
  "I do not take steroids. I never have. It's sad to me that people want to point fingers. I don't do that. That's not me. I wouldn't feel like a human being.": "Jackie",
  "Sorrows are like thunderclouds, in the distance they look black, over our heads scarcely gray.": "Jean",
  "When you socially neglect a people, when you economically abandon a people, when you transfer wealth from them to the well-to-do, what are a people going to do? They're going to respond with very sad forms of despair, and that's true for everybody - I don't care what color you are.": "Cornel",
  "I've found that people feel very free to say insulting things, not about me personally, but about the things I believe. It's sad, because I really could care less where people are coming from, politically, religiously.": "Patricia",
  "I guess I was an early method actress. I would go to a quiet part of the sound stage with my mother. I wouldn't think of anything sad, I would just make my mind a blank. In a minute I could cry.": "Shirley",
  "My loving sister Mary has always shared the pain and pleasure of my heartbeat in a unique and special way. We have sung our sad and warm songs together.": "John",
  "At the outset, I think that one should be natural, not just when it comes to writing but in every area of life. If you try to be something that you are not just to impress others, then it's a rather sad life.": "Amish",
  "I'm very sensitive. I remember, as a kid at school, if someone in the classroom was sad or angry, it could have a great impact on me.": "Aurora",
  "51st State was one that I loved doing because the character was so out there, and in a way I was sad to leave the character behind. I'm afraid I could never be that cool in real life!": "Emily",
  "Just because I'm talking about something that might have been a sad or painful situation doesn't mean that I'm sad or tortured 24 hours a day any more than anybody else is.": "Lucinda",
  "I've never really been met with indifference, where they say, 'Who cares?' I think that's what good art is supposed to do. It's not supposed to make you feel good about your own prejudices and your own values; it's supposed to open you up in some way and get you outraged or make you happy or make you sad or whatever it's going to do.": "T.",
  "Dance has helped me overcome a lot of personal challenges. If I feel sad or depressed, I just go to the set and dance. It makes me feel alive.": "Remo",
  "I'm quite an odd little part of the Venn diagram. I'm not a movie star and beautiful in that way. I do an odd thing that's funny and sad, and my face and my old body can take that.": "Tamsin",
  "I've traveled around the country and I read local newspapers and all of that, and it's a sad, sad thing to go from city to city and see the small newspapers and they're tiny. They're tiny not only in size but also in scope.": "Jim",
  "I find America falling in love with a TV show flattering and interesting, but at the same time a little sad.": "David",
  "I get to play characters that kind of shock people and I enjoy doing that. I like characters that have meaning and get people in the heart. I want to be able to get people to cry or make people angry or sad.": "Alexa",
  "I could never really choose a favorite book, but whenever I'm asked what my favorite movie is, I always say 'Withnail & I,' a British film from 1987. It's funny and sad and absolutely gorgeous to look at. It's the film I can watch over and over again.": "Lisa",
  "Yes, as an oppressed people, American Indians have this epic burden, but first and foremost, they're human: sometimes a mess, sometimes funny or sad, at times very wise, and other times not wise at all - a lot like me.": "Alexandra",
  "If I get the forty additional years statisticians say are likely coming to me, I could fit in at least one, maybe two new lifetimes. Sad that only one of those lifetimes can include being the mother of young children.": "Anna",
  "When you think about such fine actors as Maggie Smith or Michael Gambon, they do all mediums. I think it would be quite sad and a bit dull just to have to stick to one. I like all of them.": "Keeley",
  "A lot of my characters are underdogs or sad or lonely, but I had a comfortable, golden sort of childhood.": "Anthony",
  "I was friends with Susan Sontag the last four years of her life. She had this amazing charisma and so much energy, but she had a sad little funeral in Montparnasse in Paris.": "Marina",
  "Apart from the fact that your physical ability starts to decline, I also think someone in their fifties being childlike becomes a little sad. You've got to be careful.": "Rowan",
  "People are getting away from the whole album experience, it's true. I think that's sad. Maybe I'm just saying that because I'm an old fart. But I can't help it - albums are what I grew up with, and I still love them.": "Alex",
  "Depression is internal. The upswings and downswings have pretty much nothing to do with what's going on in the external world. It's not like something sad happens to you and then you feel sad. Good things happen, but you feel sad anyway.": "Graham",
  "We tell our triumphs to the crowds, but our own hearts are the sole confidants of our sorrows.": "Edward",
  "Every day, when I am working with my boys, I tell them as long as you put in your best efforts, I am there to back you. But the day I find your energy flagging on the field, the day I find you have not put in your best, that's when I will be really upset and sad.": "Nita",
  "I'm a person who likes these sort of movies... sad but moving 'art movies' that normally are at a festival and then they go to a small art house theater and disappear.": "Zach",
  "Music videos are notoriously long, not fun, grueling. You are known there as a dancer and it's kind of sad because dancers, in a lot of ways, are under-appreciated and kind of under-respected when it come to that so they don't necessarily treat you in a nice way when you do a music video.": "Jenna",
  "I went to high school with girls that would daydream about what strip club they wanted to work at. That's one of the sad things about Vegas.": "Brandon",
  "I didn't want to be on the losing side. I was fed up with Jewish weakness, timidity and fear. I didn't want any more Jewish sentimentality and Jewish suffering. I was sickened by our sad songs.": "Lionel",
  "You have to sound sad first of all, then maybe later you can sound good.": "Steve",
  "Whenever the lion fish in the fish tank in the captain's ready room died it was always a sad moment.": "Patrick",
  "I don't know what to say to that, but I have to agree with Johnny that, yeah, we do touch upon things that most men would rather not admit: That we feel pain, we cry, get sad and sometimes don't deal well with disappointment.": "Peter",
  "You've got to be happy when you play a sad character; otherwise, you just get depressed. Make your real life as fun as possible.": "Sophie",
  "It's sad that the BBC is toning down Dennis the Menace for a cartoon series. He is losing his weapons, catapult and peashooter, will no longer pick on Walter the Softy, and his ferocious grimace is to be replaced by a charming, boyish smile.": "Simon",
  "In Mississippi, you don't admit that you're gay. It's just an awkward thing down South, which is sad.": "Lance",
  "I like to write sad songs. They're much easier to write and you get a lot more emotion into them. But people don't want to hear them as much. And radio definitely doesn't; they want that positive, uptempo thing.": "Alan",
  "When I look back at those pictures of my mother performing - and listen to her recordings - it makes me sad to think that all of that joy she found in her work came to an end. I wish she hadn't had to make that sacrifice, even if it was for the benefit of my father and siblings and me.": "Marlo",
  "It's not nice to say it - I know female musicians, but not so many rappers. I can't think of one I idolize, which is sad, but I'm hoping that will change.": "Awkwafina",
  "Poetry is a beautiful way of expressing feelings - happy, sad, angry, caring. It's also a way that we share with other people, to help them with those feelings.": "Mattie",
  "I didn't know my mother had it. I think a lot of women don't know their mothers had it; that's the sad thing about depression. You know, you don't function anymore. You shut down. You feel like you are in a void.": "Marie",
  "There is something sad about clothes laid in a tomb of trunks.": "Suzy",
  "I had all these tapes in my closet that I had shot years ago with my friend Jean-Michel Basquiat. I was working on a film about him when he died, and then I just put everything away. It was too sad.": "Tamra",
  "I was a fan of 'Six Feet Under' and was very sad when it ended, so I was not ready to switch my allegiance to another show. So I was like, 'I'm not watching this 'True Blood.' Then a friend got a bootleg copy of the first four episodes, and by the third one, I was irrevocably hooked.": "Denis",
  "'m really proud of 'Sad, Sad World' because it manages to state a very complex paradox of an emotion that I experienced when I had children, which is this great happiness and this great intensity, but with that intensity comes a deeper understanding of the world.": "Jamie",
  "People say, oh it's a shame, you're not nostalgic about the '60s. Well actually, it's quite good, when you think of it. Wouldn't it be sad if I was sitting here wishing it back?": "Robert",
  "You see guys going up to girls in bars and saying, 'Oh, can I show you a trick?' It's a tool. I find it kind of sad; it breaks my heart a little bit. They should try to use their own personalities. It sort of smacks of using magic as a crutch, which is not what it should be.": "Keith",
  "Making people laugh is so much more difficult than making them sad. Too much fiction defaults to the somber, the tragic. This is because sad endings are easy in comparison - happy endings aren't at all simple to earn, especially when writing to an audience jaded by them.": "Stephen",
  "It's much easier to write when you're sad. But you can end up isolated and depressed because you almost need to put yourself in that situation to have that angst to write from.": "Natalie",
  "Divorce was very sad, obviously, but now I've gotten over it.": "Natalie",
  "I so desperately hate to end these movies that the first thing I do when I'm done is write another one. Then I don't feel sad about having to leave and everybody going away. That's why I tend to work with the same people I really befriend them. ": "John",
  "My greatest regret is not having gone to Wellesley College. it is something I have felt a little sad about my whole life.": "Rose",
  "As a songwriter I hate this whole, 'If it's a sad song, it has to sound like a sad song thing.' And that goes all the way back to my days with the Format. I'm an insane narcissist, so if I have to get something off my chest, I'll get something off my chest.": "Nate",
  "I take my inspiration for the song writing from little experiences, not even if I've experienced them myself but say if something has made me sad, I will use that emotion. I just use everyday life and write about it.": "Pixie",
  "I think people tend to forget that as celebrities we are still human. We have the same emotions - we cry, we have fun, we laugh, we get sad, and we get hurt. When something is written about you, which millions of people are reading, and it is not true, imagine how hurtful it can be.": "Sania",
  "The music of ABBA is not that happy. It might sound happy, in some strange way, but deep within, it's not happy music. It has that Nordic melancholic feeling to it. What fools you is the girls' voices. You know, I do think that is one of the secrets about ABBA. Even when we were really quite sad, we always sounded jubilant.": "Bjorn",
  "We have real cliched ideas of what prison life is like. It is not a happy place. It's a desperate, sad situation.": "Powers",
  "My comedy is for children from three to 93. You do need a slightly childish sense of humour and if you haven't got that, it's very sad.": "Norman",
  "There is perhaps no more rewarding romance heroine than she who is not expected to find love. The archetype comes in many disguises - the wallflower, the spinster, the governess, the single mom - but always with one sad claim: Love is not in her cards.": "Sarah",
  "You play to different parts of yourself when you take on various roles. Like, you are your confident self when you're playing this person, and you're your sad self when playing another person - but it's all a part of you somewhere.": "Riley",
  "The sad part about our past is that religions, ironically enough, are responsible for creating the most destructive idea that has ever been visited upon the human race: the idea that there is such a thing as 'better.'": "Neale",
  "For a woman who's a widow and pretty much a loner, I can walk out, and I'm surrounded by NYU kids. The energy jumps off the sidewalks, and I never feel sad or bored.": "Blythe",
  "Ideally, I would love to mix singing and acting, but you can only be a pop star for so many years. I mean, at 30 it's a little bit sad, right?": "Rachel",
  "I think a lot of people think that my parents' deaths is why I write such sad songs, but that's not true. Those songs may just be the woman I am.": "Shelby",
  "I ran track in college. And that team, that all-lady team that I was on, I can remember just being so incredibly sad that I knew we were all going to leave each other after we graduated and that our lives would change. And even though I was the bridesmaid at all their weddings and stuff like that, it's just not the same, right?": "Kay",
  "I had lost my grandfather just a month-and-a-half before I made my debut. I was suddenly scoring runs and getting into the fray. It was a very trying period for me. I was happy as well as sad.": "Mohammad",
  "I'm so grounded, it's sad.": "Patti",
  "When you do a good comedy show, you have to understand that if you don't have drama or sad moments, then the comedy turns into a clowning kind of situation.": "Jaime",
  "It's not like I force myself to think of sad things, but... it's more that I make music because it makes me happy.": "Jamie",
  "Sometimes it makes me sad that I didn't get to have one family for my entire life.": "Isabel",
  "I wrote the song For A Dancer for a friend of mine who died in a fire. He was in the sauna in a house that burned down, so he had no idea anything was going on. It was very sad.": "Jackson",
  "It's nice to be with someone, but I don't think you need to be in a relationship to feel complete. That would be really sad.": "Kristin",
  "I love sad. Sadness makes you feel more than anything.": "Jeff",
  "Ghost! I miss him! Is that weird? I miss him even though I invented him. I feel a lot of tenderness toward him. I don't write a lot of stuff that is sad or that is tender and affectionate, so that has a very special place in my heart.": "Mallory",
  "I love my past, I love my present. I am not ashamed of what I have had, and I am not sad because I no longer have it.": "Sidonie",
  "I feel quite sad for the young musicians coming up because they may never get to pay their rent properly. It doesn't matter what the genre; nowadays, it's so much harder than it ever was.": "Bryan",
  "I'm a sucker for a sad song.": "Chris",
  "I write about heartbreak because I like writing about sad things, but I'm writing happy songs, too!": "Jackie",
  "I think it's bad for fellas when they lose their mothers. Mine was such a character. Oh it was sad, really sad. And, with her gone, the family home was gone, so what was left of any roots I had were completely dug up.": "Paul",
  "I fear that I won't work in the theatre again. I'm sad about that. But I won't retire.": "Maggie",
  "I think a lot about when times were simpler, when I was still dancing and living with my parents. I really miss living at home sometimes. I get really sad.": "Hailey",
  "Well, you know, too much democracy is a sort of sad thing.": "Ann",
  "It's been a bit sad to see that out of Linux distributions, it was Android - the most successful mobile Linux distribution - that has really introduced the malware problem to the Linux world.": "Mikko",
  "I felt sad because everyday I had to wake up early to practice before going to school. After school I had to go back to tennis again, and then after tennis I had homework. I didn't have time to play.": "Li",
  "It's a sad day when the leaders of the free world engage in such deception and trickery. I voted against this unnecessary war and will continue to argue that the best way to support our troops is to bring them home.": "Major",
  "What is sad to me is not what Bill Nye thinks about me. What I found really unfortunate is that after presenting my stand on God's Word, there were a number of Christians who were more complimentary of Bill Nye than of me because Bill Nye was defending evolution and billions of years.": "Ken",
  "I don't find it uncomfortable that I'm recognized and liked by so many people. If that were hard for me, I wouldn't be doing this work. Rather, I think I'd be more sad when a day come when people don't recognize me.": "Song",
  "If I don't make it, I'll be very sad that there are things I didn't do, but I'm happy that I've done what I have.": "Stephen",
  "Home will always be Northern Ireland but my schedule means for the next few years I won't be there as much. I can't do the same things that I did a year ago. That is I'm something conscious of, but I'm not sad about it. It's fine.": "Rory",
  "I like to play the grey areas in life - that's the most uncomfortable place to be. Nobody likes to be in that in-between state where there don't know what's going to happen. There's a lot of tension in that, and a lot of stuff to play with - where it's uncomfortable and awkward and sad and scary.": "Melanie",
  "Women often don't want to be typecast as the girl that's sad.": "Julia",
  "If you listen to the radio, it's all men who are emotional and women who are sexual. There's nothing wrong with that! It definitely should be the case, but it makes me sad that women are afraid to be emotional because it makes them look weak.": "Julia",
  "Budget cuts are a sad reality in most newsrooms, and I am concerned that they reduce the collective muscle of journalists who are doing the expensive, and often dangerous, work of on-the-ground reporting.": "Jill",
  "I am not a sad clown. I am not a sad clown.": "Nathan",
  "I know that some endeavor to throw the mantle of romance over the subject and treat woman like some ideal existence, not liable to the ills of life. Let those deal in fancy who have nothing better to deal in; we have to do with sober, sad realities, with stubborn facts.": "Ernestine",
  "With the other fellow actors who have gone astray, I think it's sad that society wants to label the business as doing this to people. It's really not true.": "Tina",
  "I remember that I used to get lots of books from the library, and 'Little Women' was one of them. And I used to just cross out the parts of it that really upset me because it's such a sad book in so many ways. I'd cross out the parts that upset me, and I would rewrite new endings.": "Helen",
  "It's not that we like sad movies that make us feel like, 'Oh, my God, what a bummer.' We like emotionally moving experiences. It's nothing new. It's catharsis. It goes back to the Greeks.": "Gayle",
  "People are so codified - it's sad.": "Jean",
  "It is sad to see a woman sacrificing the ties of the affections even to do good.": "Maria",
  "My beauty secret is to try to keep my heart as open and happy as I can, because it really makes the sad lines on my face look better.": "Lea",
  "Cyndi Lauper's 'Time After Time' was a perfect song. It was so beautiful and so heartfelt. Her vocals were so amazing. And, for me, that was a song I went to when I was feeling sad and wanted to feel even sadder.": "Lea",
  "You go from nobody looking at you to people taking second looks. I remember really loving it - and then feeling so guilty for loving it. Like, 'That's gross, Kristen.' Also, telling myself it could go away at any moment, and I'd be so sad.": "Kristen",
  "Nowadays you really have to pump out that blockbuster in order to have the luxury of getting a body of work, and that's sad because the work suffers. Today everything is based on money. The older actors, they inspire me.": "Dylan",
  "Well in the end the world can crank itself up to sanctions, as it has with Zimbabwe, another sad case.": "Helen",
  "I think some women try to make you feel you're not all female because you haven't given birth. There are a lot of prejudices. Some women think women who have animals are deeply sad, because what they really want is a child. Mind you, there's probably an element of truth in that.": "Alison",
  "I belong in America more than South Africa. I can't remember the feeling of living there anymore. It's like it was in another life. That's sad in a way. It is my country. It's where I grew up. You don't know what it's like to have these negative feelings about your homeland. There are roots you can't escape.": "Trevor",
  "I have the deepest respect for Eva Gabrielsson and all she has gone through, but I also know that I make maybe her sad, and I am sad about that, but I make so many other people happy.": "David",
  "Sad will be the day for any man when he becomes contented with the thoughts he is thinking and the deeds he is doing - where there is not forever beating at the doors of his soul some great desire to do something larger which he knows he was meant and made to do. ": "Phillips",
  "You know how sad your life is when you know the release date of DVDs.": "Heston",
  "I love New York. I was sad, depressed and incredibly moved by our fellow countrymen and what they've done. I wanted to give people a chance to see something funny, have a distraction.": "Ben",
  "Everybody likes Johnny Cash. I think the sad part of it is his health is givin' him problems.": "Merle",
  "As virtuous men pass mildly away, and whisper to their souls to go, whilst some of their sad friends do say, the breath goes now, and some say no.": "John",
  "Unfortunately, we are living in an era where plenty of songs with vulgar, objectionable lyrics are also becoming popular. It's a disturbing trend, and I feel really sad when I see small kids dancing to such numbers in television shows. In my career so far, I have refused any song whose lyrics I haven't been comfortable with.": "Shreya",
  "If I'm extra happy or excited, it'll take me an hour or two to write a song. Or, if I'm really sad or something, it will take me about a day. But I have a specific way of writing: I just listen to the beat. I think about what I'm going to write over the beat.": "Astro",
  "I look at my people, and I look at those who control them - the political elite. And the sad thing is that the elites are just not interested in the welfare of the people.": "Youssou",
  "Here in the United States, our profession is much maligned, people simply don't trust or like journalists anymore and that's sad.": "Christiane",

  "It's sad that people listen to music and decide how the singer should look.": "Joss",
  "I don't sit down to write a funny story. Every single thing I sit down to write is meant to be sad.": "Lorrie",
  "It's really sad looking at people like Lindsay Lohan. She's an amazing actress, but you see what happens when people know too much about your personal life. They start not being able to look at you the same way professionally. I don't want that to happen to me.": "Dianna",
  "If I'm laughing, you know I'm either very happy or very sad. I cope with things with jokes.": "Cristela",

  "I pity my brother Ferdinand, knowing by my own feelings how sad a thing it is to live apart from one's family.": "Marie",
  "All he cares about is going out there with his Jack Daniels bottle. Nothing has changed. That's kind of sad. If David was doing better than he used to be, then that would be different. But it was a joke and he made it that way.": "Sammy",
  "We all like stories that make us cry. It's so nice to feel sad when you've nothing in particular to feel sad about.": "Anne",

  "I would be a very sad person if I didn't have dance in my life. However I can, whatever I do, I just feel a lot of joy. Even if I am sad, if you take me to a rehearsal hall, I will automatically become happy.": "Mouni",
  "It's sad when you can't make everyone happy, though. It's impossible but, at the same time, you still hope. You think, 'Maybe I can do it,' but you know you can't. But gosh, if I had to rely on giving people what they wanted, I would have had to write 40 billion different books and even then, I wouldn't get it right.": "Stephenie",

  "Because the sad fact is that the Enron Corporation and others manipulated with unfortunately great effect the energy market in the West Coast starting in 2000.": "Jay",
  "You know what I have noticed? And this is really sad. Flying first class is less scary than flying coach. They speak to you and they're so nice to you and they want to help you and they know you want a drink before the plane takes off. And they bring it to you without asking. If you're sitting in coach and hoping for a drink, good luck.": "Hope",
  "And for some reason, when I'm sad, I do listen to Leonard Cohen, I do listen to Joni Mitchell. I do find myself going to the music that's actually reflecting my mood, as opposed to sticking on Motown, which might actually bring my mood up.": "Glen",
  "I'm more apt to cry at something beautiful than at something sad.": "Teller",
  "Guys should not be allowed to use the Internet all day long. So sad.": "Natasha",

  "Money is a tremendous advantage in just about everything, but in terms of reproduction, if you're a poor woman and you are infertile, it's like too bad, so sad. And if you are a wealthy woman, you can kind of buy whatever you want.": "Jennifer",

  "I'm sad to say that stardom is a commodity in our culture.": "Christine",
  "What I like on Kickstarter is when I see real innovation and I see people building something new. It makes me sad when I see things that are just the same technology you aren't passing the technology forward. ": "Bre",
  "For a novelist, no matter what, it's a complete work, even if it's not published. But if you write a screenplay, and it's not performed, then it's a sad and frustrating experience.": "Susan",
  "I think the meaning of abortion is what the woman says it is: For a woman who wants a child but can't have this one, it can be sad; for a woman who doesn't want a baby, it can feel like a huge relief, like having your whole life given back to you.": "Katha",
  "There are times when I'm really happy and I write something really sad, and vice versa.": "Juan",

  "The Holy Spirit can be with you always and guide you back to Him, but in order to enjoy the benefits of this holy gift, you must truly receive it, and then you must use it in your life. How sad it would be to be given such a precious gift and then set it aside and never use it.": "Margaret",
  "It's so sad: anything that has to do with God, people want to dispel.": "Sylvia",

  "I can honestly say - not proudly, but honestly - before I had a child, I would see things on TV or hear the news, feel sad for the people and move forward with my day. Now I see everything through a mother's eyes.": "Marissa",
  "I watch so much TV, it's sad. I watch 'Happy Endings', '30 Rock', 'Parks and Rec', 'The Office', 'Eagleheart', 'Children's Hospital'. 'Modern Family' I guess I'm still kinda watching.": "Anders",
  "I mean, the unfair treatment of women and black people and Indians and other groups, that's real. Mistreatment of other people because 'I'm better than you are' is such a sad part of the world.": "Melissa",
  "To be a character who feels a deep emotion, one must go into the memory's vault and mix in a sad memory from one's own life.": "Albert",
  "There are a lot of people who consider themselves 'spiritual,' but that can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. I don't really talk about it that often, because there's too much talk in the world. Especially with Christians, there's more proselytizing than there is actual living proof of it. That's kind of sad.": "Zachary",
  "So far, at least, I haven't found a way to tell my kind of stories without making them both sad and funny.": "Todd",
  "It's a sad commentary when I have to say that sometimes in our country we are real sensitive to race.": "Oscar",
  "But now Americans, they felt a sense of peace and protection because they've been separated by so many thousands of miles of ocean. And you know, the fact that it's come to the U.S. like this is so sad, and yet you know, what can you do? It's here.": "Patty",
  "I'm not a very serious person. You know how they say that clowns are very funny in public and are really sad at home? I'm really kind of stupid at home and more serious in public.": "Roland",
  "It's sad that my daughter will get attention because of her daddy. I'm already watching her run around the house and pick up microphones. It's scary.": "Bow",
  "I think a lot of times we're so told in our world that marriage is everything, and having a partner is everything. If you look at our movies and things, it's all directed around that love, and if you don't have that love, how sad you are.": "Brooke",
  "It's sad that because I have one friend who is in the public eye, just being seen out together once means we're romantically involved. But I don't take it seriously, and it doesn't really affect me much.": "Dylan",
  "The sad thing is that, for many writers of fantasy fiction, the inclusion of magic seems to mean that logical ramifications and real-world laws both go out the window.": "Jane",
  "As a child, I was subjected to a lot of spaghetti Westerns and hated them. I wanted the Indians to win - or just not be so sad!": "Kara",

  "In film, you can have sad endings.": "Anna",
  "I love the sad songs with their maudlin, self-deprecating, almost funny lyrics. As an Englishman, they make a lot of sense.": "Teddy",

  "When 'Foyle's War' ended in 2010 after seven series, I was sad but not despondent. After all, ITV had already axed the show once in 2007, then brought it back due to public demand.": "Honeysuckle",
  "People just don't like me, and it's unfortunate, because I'm trying to get people to come down and visit New Zealand. I'm an ambassador for New Zealand... it's kind of sad.": "Steven",

  "It's sad that we have become so accustomed to bad service that we're shocked when we get good service.": "Neil",
  "'Vegas' was something very close to me. I had such a blast doing that. I'm still a little upset that we never really got to shoot that final episode. So many people were invested in it. I'll always be sad about that.": "Josh",
  "It would be sad if my best work had been 20 years ago and now I only had memories.": "Demian",
  "I think the best thing about my short-lived political career was that I saw the interiors of Bihar and UP. That is the real India, and, being an Indian, it was really sad to see our own people living in such dismal conditions. It was a real eye-opener.": "Sanjay",
  "Many Russia experts note the deep and sad capacity of the Russian people for suffering.": "Roger",

  "The delta blues is a low-down, dirty shame blues. It's a sad, big wide sound, something to make you think about people who are dead or the women who left you.": "David",
  "If I don't get at least one e-mail every ten minutes, I feel unloved. Even junk mail makes me feel seen. Sad, I know. Sigh.": "Chris",
  "I'm very free with all my emotions, whether it's happy, sad, mad, glad, whatever.": "Kimberly",
  "I have never had a current state of mind. My mind changes a great deal. I am very affected by any sorrow or sad thing, and I am very affected by joy and beauty.": "Luise",
  "Teaching is a truly noble profession. It's sad the amount of responsibility that teachers have today. They're not only teaching kids: they're raising kids, policing kids - and they don't make a lot of money.": "Jesse",
  "You will soon find that I am a bit obsessive about my work. And that is a little sad, one often feels strangely restricted, not finding time to simmer, although one actually has many interests.": "Arne",
  "People talk about games and loneliness - it's a lonely activity. I didn't understand that. 'Gears of War' was the first multiplayer game for me that I enjoyed. But I wasn't sad. I liked being alone. I liked playing games by myself. I had lots of companionship at the house.": "Tim",
  "I love playing football, being out on the pitch with a ball, and I will be a little sad when that ends.": "Dennis",

  "This was an important part of my life. But it was also sad that we didn't play there, cause we had such alot of fans that were waiting for us and Brazilians are great people. It's now my second home.": "Jim",

  "The sad events that occur in my life are the sad events that happen to everybody, with losing friends and family, but that is a natural occurrence, as natural as being born.": "Sergio",

  "I can see the humorous side of things and enjoy the fun when it comes; but look where I will, there seems to me always more sadness than joy in life.": "Jerome",
  "I've grown as a person. The dynamics on this set are very demanding because we work a lot of hours, it's very sad material, so there's always someone upset because it's really heavy stuff.": "Elisabeth",
  "It would indeed be a sad misfortune if man were released from the necessity of work and struggle, for it is a well-known fact that organs which do not function atrophy; and according to the old saying, 'Idleness is the devil's workshop.'": "Charles",
  "You put a song on the record or on tape and you stop singing it. You just don't sit around and sing it anymore unless you're performing. That's kind of sad.": "Rick",
  "It can be really powerful to write something when you're sad.": "Kathryn",
  "All my work shares a kind of balance between black comedy and sad and despairing melancholy.": "Martin",
  "My favorite monster has always been the zombie. They are so much fun. They can be scary, pathetic, sad, funny, tragic, even heroic. They are the most elastic monster because, even with all of that, they don't interfere with telling stories about the humans. They serve as threats and metaphors, but they allow the story to be about people.": "Jonathan",
  "Your joys and sorrows. You can never tell them. You cheapen the inside of yourself if you do tell them.": "Greta",
  "I think coldness is chic among writers, and particularly ironic coldness. What is absolutely not allowable is sadness. People will do anything rather than to acknowledge that they are sad.": "Mary",
  "You are validating someone's life by telling their story. Even if it's a sad one.": "Alex",
  "I think the intellectual consistency of Christianity in historical evidence is frankly overwhelming, but my materialist colleagues regard me as a slightly sad case.": "Simon",
  "You want people to feel something when you tell a story, whether they feel happy or whether they feel sad.": "Harry",
  "With sad music, or music that's perceived as sad, there's a sense of solidarity that can be really powerful. My songs are all joyful to me.": "J.",
  "You have to let it all hang out, let go of the ideas that were more comfortable and embrace some of the sadness in your life.": "Madeleine",
  "If you win all the time, you lose the drama in life. To make the happy moments happy, you need the sad moments too.": "Doug",
  "I think people just think I am crazy because they see me doing stand-up, but I am generally not. I am very sad. I'm one of those guys that lights candles and listens to Rachmaninoff.": "Bobby",
  "I always go in very emotionally when I'm doing music. Sad or happy, I'm always into it. I have a hard time writing for other people, writing with someone else in mind.": "Erik",
  "I mean, I was just one of the ones who got exposed, and because of the position I was in, where I was in my life, it went mainstream. A lot of people got out of it after my situation, not because I went to prison but because it was sad for them to see me go through something that was so pointless, that could have been avoided.": "Michael",
  "Kind of the sad thing is that - it's still true - a lot of jazz people just listen to jazz, and a lot of hip-hop people just listen to hip-hop, and there's not a lot of crossover, unfortunately.": "Jose",
  "The pro athlete is a sad tale. He signs a big contract and thinks he's set for life. I didn't think I was set for life, and I don't now. As athletes, we are important, celebrities, in demand and rich. Then we are out of the game and we are not important, not celebrities, not in demand and not rich.": "Fran",
  "I'd love to have a room full of taxidermy. I'd be devastated if my cat, Archimedes, ever died. I was debating the other day with a friend whether I should stuff him, but don't know whether he would end up looking like himself. I'd be really sad if he looked strange.": "Tuppence",
  "Tears are the natural penalties of pleasure. It is a law that we should pay for all that we enjoy.": "William",
  "When sparrows build and the leaves break forth, My old sorrow wakes and cries.": "Jean",
  "If someone is sad, they put on a song, or if someone wants to rock out, and they want to get into a good mood, they put on music. Just being able to be a part of something like that I feel like was my ultimate push to do music.": "Adam",
  "I don't have many regrets. I regret mistakes, particularly those that damage other people, and we've all made some of those. But I'm not sad about change.": "John",
  "It's a sad moment, really, when parents first become a bit frightened of their children.": "Ama",
  "Mainly, I thought of Barney as a kid. You can always look into the faces of kids and see what they're thinking, if they're happy or sad. That's what I tried to do with Barney.": "Don",
  "I was depressed a lot as a kid, and I was really sad and wouldn't be able to get out of bed.": "Alisha",
  "My acting's very understated. I think my sad and happy don't play that differently onscreen.": "Bret",
  "It takes a long time for a country to build a strong base in science, but only a short time to destroy it. Germany was a sad example. It was a world leader in the sciences for more than a century, until its science base was demolished during the Nazi era, and the country ceded its position to the United States.": "Torsten",
  "Everything's complicated, even those things that seem flat in their bleakness or sadness.": "Nick",

  "My parents were mourning the death of my sister. She was killed in a car accident before I was born, and I didn't know she existed until I was 13 or 14 years old. I knew I was growing up in a house where people were angry and sad.": "Andrew",

  "Social media is not about the exploitation of technology but service to community.": "Simon",
  "The number one benefit of information technology is that it empowers people to do what they want to do. It lets people be creative. It lets people be productive. It lets people learn things they didn't think they could learn before, and so in a sense it is all about potential.": "Steve",
  "While technology is important, it's what we do with it that truly matters.": "Muhammad",
  "Our generation grew up with technology. It evolved as we grew up. This new generation has had it since they were babies. That's crazy. It fundamentally changes they way they understand and think about technology. They've never known life without it, whereas we knew life without the Internet.": "Brit",
  "The only constant in the technology industry is change.": "Marc",
  "If you run from technology, it will chase you.": "Robert",
  "Technology is unlocking the innate compassion we have for our fellow human beings.": "Bill",

  "The Internet is so big, so powerful and pointless that for some people it is a complete substitute for life.": "Andrew",
  "Our intuition about the future is linear. But the reality of information technology is exponential, and that makes a profound difference. If I take 30 steps linearly, I get to 30. If I take 30 steps exponentially, I get to a billion.": "Ray",
  "Capitalist production, therefore, develops technology, and the combining together of various processes into a social whole, only by sapping the original sources of all wealth - the soil and the labourer.": "Karl",
  "Genetically modified organism (GMO) foods are feared and hated by environmentalists and the public alike. Yet the scientific assessment of GMOs is remarkably different. Every major scientific evaluation of GMO technology has concluded that GMOs are safe for human consumption and are a benefit to the environment.": "Ramez",
  "Technology has advanced more in the last thirty years than in the previous two thousand. The exponential increase in advancement will only continue.": "Niels",
  "The over-all point is that new technology will not necessarily replace old technology, but it will date it. By definition. Eventually, it will replace it. But it's like people who had black-and-white TVs when color came out. They eventually decided whether or not the new technology was worth the investment.": "Steve",

  "Virtual reality is a technology that could actually allow you to connect on a real human level, soul-to-soul, regardless of where you are in the world.": "Chris",
  "Our technology, our machines, is part of our humanity. We created them to extend ourselves, and that is what is unique about human beings.": "Ray",

  "Language is a more recent technology. Your body language, your eyes, your energy will come through to your audience before you even start speaking.": "Peter",
  "Technology just means information technology.": "Peter",
  "I'm fascinated by the idea that genetics is digital. A gene is a long sequence of coded letters, like computer information. Modern biology is becoming very much a branch of information technology.": "Richard",

  "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware.": "Alan",

  "Relying on the government to protect your privacy is like asking a peeping tom to install your window blinds.": "John",

  "Especially in technology, we need revolutionary change, not incremental change.": "Larry",

  "If you think back to the beginning of cell phones, laptops or really any new technology, it's always expensive.": "Elon",
  "Traits acquired during one's lifetime - muscles built up in the gym, for example - cannot be passed on to the next generation. Now with technology, as it happens, we might indeed be able to transfer some of our acquired traits on to our selected offspring by genetic engineering.": "Nick",
  "It is only by the rational use of technology to control and guide what technology is doing that we can keep any hopes of a social life more desirable than our own: or in fact of a social life which is not appalling to imagine.": "Carrie",
  "We know that, when it comes to technology and the economy, if you're not constantly moving forward, then - without a doubt - you're moving backwards.": "Bill",
  "One of the biggest challenges to medicine is the incorporation of information technology in our practices.": "Samuel",
  "Healthcare is becoming part of information technology.": "Bill",
  "It might sound like I'm a dreamer, but economic models have reached their height of evolution. Technology has evolved. What hasn't evolved is mankind's spirituality; everything is from 3,000 years ago. With spirituality comes morals, a better way of thinking.": "Damian",
  "Digital technology has several features that can make it much easier for teachers to pay special attention to all their students.": "Bill",
  "The world has today 546 nuclear plants generating electricity. Their experience is being continuously researched, and feedback should be provided to all. Nuclear scientists have to interact with the people of the nation, and academic institutions continuously update nuclear power generation technology and safety.": "A.",

  "The Linux philosophy is 'Laugh in the face of danger'. Oops. Wrong One. 'Do it yourself'. Yes, that's it.": "Linus",
  "Many people who try to do big bold things in the world find out it's not about the money or the technology: It's about the regulatory hurdles that will try and stop you.": "Peter",
  "SpaceX is only 12 years old now. Between now and 2040, the company's lifespan will have tripled. If we have linear improvement in technology, as opposed to logarithmic, then we should have a significant base on Mars, perhaps with thousands or tens of thousands of people.": "Elon",
  "Ever since the arrival of printing - thought to be the invention of the devil because it would put false opinions into people's minds - people have been arguing that new technology would have disastrous consequences for language.": "David",
  "Computers are still technology because we are still wrestling with it: it's still being invented we're still trying to work out how it works. There's a world of game interaction to come that you or I wouldn't recognise. It's time for the machines to disappear. The computer's got to disappear into all of the things we use.": "Douglas",
  "CRATEL is a center with a two-fold mission - to explore technology as an expressive element and to use technology to bridge gaps between diverse groups of people.": "John",
  "Pretty soon we'll have robots in our society, you're going to have a lot of automated processes that used to be done by people - this is happening. Society and technology is changing so fast, and the impact of the change on society and technology is global, not local.": "Jose",
  "Banking technology has made it simple and efficient to invest in good causes.": "Mark",
  "All of our technology is completely unnecessary to a happy life.": "Tom",
  "I think technology is us, not something we invented. I think we are more psychic now because we have cell phones and you can look and see who's calling you. When people start seeing technology as us, as humanity, our whole idea of what existence is, is going to shift.": "Ryan",
  "We always say Jordan is not rich in natural resources - we don't have oil or gas like some of our neighbors do - but I think in terms of human resources, we are quite lucky and we are really trying to foster an environment of innovation and technology. I think Jordan will emerge as a center of innovation in the Middle East.": "Queen",
  "Technology has allowed me to reach my fans directly. Social media: it has been a complete revolution of how to interact, promote and share things.": "Tony",
  "I love the new technology. New things give you a reason to want to go to the studio. New challenges mean you have to keep up, you know?": "Dr.",
  "It's one of the fundamental principles of the stock market: When interest rates go up, stocks go down. And along with financial companies and cyclicals, technology companies - with their sky-high price-to-earnings multiples - should be among the biggest losers in an environment of rising rates.": "Alex",
  "Of course, technology is not an exogenous force over which humans have no control. We are not constrained by a binary choice between acceptance and rejection. Rather, the decisions we make every day as citizens, consumers, and investors guide technological progress.": "Klaus",
  "I will talk about two sets of things. One is how productivity and collaboration are reinventing the nature of work, and how this will be very important for the global economy. And two, data. In other words, the profound impact of digital technology that stems from data and the data feedback loop.": "Satya",

  "Television is a medium because anything well done is rare.": "Fred",
  "There is a huge need and a huge opportunity to get everyone in the world connected, to give everyone a voice and to help transform society for the future. The scale of the technology and infrastructure that must be built is unprecedented, and we believe this is the most important problem we can focus on.": "Mark",
  "Communism is a monopolistic system, economically and politically. The system suppresses individual initiative, and the 21st century is all about individualism and freedom. The development of technology supported these directions.": "Lech",
  "'Social engineering,' the fancy term for tricking you into giving away your digital secrets, is at least as great a threat as spooky technology.": "Barton",

  "The only protection as a historian is to institute a process of research and writing that minimizes the possibility of error. And that I have tried to do, aided by modern technology, which enables me, having long since moved beyond longhand, to use a computer for both organizing and taking notes.": "Doris",
  "With a fourth generation of nuclear power, you can have a technology that will burn more than 99 percent of the energy in the fuel. It would mean that you don't need to mine uranium for the next thousand years.": "James",
  "I think there's a gigantic generation gap in terms of how people understand the Internet and how much they think technology is an important factor in social change.": "Alex",
  "'The Victorian Internet' is a must read for anyone interested in the history of technology and in the cycles of hype, boom, and bust that seem to only quicken with each new wave of innovation. Highly recommended.": "John",
  "Robots are interesting because they exist as a real technology that you can really study - you can get a degree in robotics - and they also have all this pop-culture real estate that they take up in people's minds.": "Daniel",
  "The Web as I envisaged it, we have not seen it yet. The future is still so much bigger than the past.": "Tim",
  "Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts.": "William",
  "I think complexity is mostly sort of crummy stuff that is there because it's too expensive to change the interface.": "Jaron",
  "I used to think that cyberspace was fifty years away. What I thought was fifty years away, was only ten years away. And what I thought was ten years away... it was already here. I just wasn't aware of it yet.": "Bruce",
  "The march of science and technology does not imply growing intellectual complexity in the lives of most people. It often means the opposite.": "Thomas",
  "It's hard to pay attention these days because of multiple affects of the information technology nowadays. You tend to develop a faster, speedier mind, but I don't think it's necessarily broader or smarter.": "Robert",
  "Refuse to accept the belief that your professional relevance, career success or financial security turns on the next update on the latest technology. Sometimes it's good to put the paddle down and just let the canoe glide.": "Simon",
  "There's still something so pure and heartfelt and emotional and genuine about a bouquet of flowers that, even with all the advances of technology and the millions of ways we have to communicate with each other, flowers are still relevant in my opinion.": "Vanessa",
  "If Wikileaks didn't resolve that question for folks - at the end of the day, there are no secrets. We're living in a glass neighborhood, in a fishbowl, and technology, white hat hackers, the folks that are doing the right thing with hacking.": "Gavin",
  "If you think technology can solve your security problems, then you don't understand the problems and you don't understand the technology.": "Bruce",
  "Self-awareness is not just relaxation and not just meditation. It must combine relaxation with activity and dynamism. Technology can aid that.": "Deepak",
  "There is no technology today that cannot be defeated by social engineering.": "Frank",
  "In today's knowledge-based economy, what you earn depends on what you learn. Jobs in the information technology sector, for example, pay 85 percent more than the private sector average.": "William",
  "As information technology restructures the work situation, it abstracts thought from action.": "Shoshana",
  "I wanted to be a pilot. I loved flying and I loved all the technology and the equipment and the sense of adventure that came with it. I think that feeling still bleeds over into everything I do today.": "Graham",
  "Every technology, including the printing press, comes at some price.": "Bill",
  "I don't think any of us can do much about the rapid growth of new technology. A new technology helps to fuel the economy, and any discussion of slowing its growth has to take account of economic consequences. However, it is possible for us to learn how to control our own uses of technology.": "Neil",
  "The easiest way to stop piracy is not by putting antipiracy technology to work. It's by giving those people a service that's better than what they're receiving from the pirates.": "Gabe",

  "We must learn to balance the material wonders of technology with the spiritual demands of our human race.": "John",
  "Why are we, as a nation so obsessed with foreign things? Is it a legacy of our colonial years? We want foreign television sets. We want foreign shirts. We want foreign technology. Why this obsession with everything imported?": "A.",

  "When we're talking about technology that involves weapons of mass destruction, nuclear, chemical or biological weapons, there has to be an element of preemption.": "John",
  "Today, the technology is there to give early and normally ample warning when a powerful tornado approaches. When a tornado strikes, all of us are at risk.": "Spencer",

  "The underlying principles of strategy are enduring, regardless of technology or the pace of change.": "Michael",
  "The spoken word was the first technology by which man was able to let go of his environment in order to grasp it in a new way.": "Marshall",

  "We were promised a simpler life, and technology has only complicated our lives.": "Freeman",

  "I love technology. We can be our own DJs wherever we go.": "Ludacris",
  "If you wanna know how not secure you are, just take a look around. Nothing's secure. Nothing's safe. I don't hate technology, I don't hate hackers, because that's just what comes with it, without those hackers we wouldn't solve the problems we need to solve, especially security.": "Fred",
  "Who knows what technology will emerge in the next five years, let alone 20. Yet the education we provide our children now is supposed to last for decades. We cannot train them for jobs that do not even exist yet, but we can provide them with the minds and tools they'll need to adapt to our ever-changing set of circumstances.": "Jim",
  "You can be good at technology and like fashion and art. You can be good at technology and be a jock. You can be good at technology and be a mom. You can do it your way, on your terms.": "Marissa",
  "A company can spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on firewalls, intrusion detection systems and encryption and other security technologies, but if an attacker can call one trusted person within the company, and that person complies, and if the attacker gets in, then all that money spent on technology is essentially wasted.": "Kevin",
  "I know nothing about technology.": "Jack",
  "Sampling is kind of prehistoric, given the technology and the textures you can create.": "Macklemore",
  "The moment of drifting into thought has been so clipped by modern technology. Our lives are filled with distraction with smartphones and all the rest. People are so locked into not being present.": "Glen",
  "Advancements in technology have become so commonplace that sometimes we forget to stop and think about how incredible it is that a girl on her laptop in Texas can see photos and cell phone video in real time that a young college student has posted of a rally he's at in Iran.": "Rosalind",
  "Disco is the first technology music. And what I mean is that 'disco' music is named after discs, because when technology grew to where they didn't need a band in the clubs, the DJ played it on a disc.": "will.i.am",
  "A revolution is to bring on change and we're spiritual people trying to bring on spiritual change. It might sound like I'm a dreamer, but economic models have reached their height of evolution. Technology has evolved. What hasn't evolved is mankind's spirituality; everything is from 3,000 years ago.": "Damian",
  "The joke about SAP has always been, it's making '50s German manufacturing methodology, implemented in 1960s software technology, delivered to 1970-style manufacturing organizations, like, it's really - yeah, the incumbency - they are still the lingering hangover from the dot-com crash.": "Marc",
  "Electricity is an example of a general purpose technology, like the steam engine before it. General purpose technologies drive most economic growth, because they unleash cascades of complementary innovations, like lightbulbs and, yes, factory redesign.": "Erik",
  "The biggest challenge is that when people look at low price point products, they essentially invest less money in development, innovation, and new technology. And in order to innovate at a lower price point, and make sustainability attainable to the masses, you have to invest more. But that's counterintuitive for a lot of businesses.": "Yves",
  "We're moving to this integration of biomedicine, information technology, wireless and mobile now - an era of digital medicine. Even my stethoscope is now digital. And of course, there's an app for that.": "Daniel",
  "The rate of technological and human physiological change in the 20th century has been remarkable. Beyond that, a synergy between the improved technology and physiology is more than the simple addition of the two.": "Robert",
  "Digital technology allows us a much larger scope to tell stories that were pretty much the grounds of the literary media.": "George",
  "My filmmaking really began with technology. It began through technology, not through telling stories, because my 8mm movie camera was the way into whatever I decided to do.": "Steven",
  "There was a time in the 1930s when magazine writers could actually make a good living. 'The Saturday Evening Post' and 'Collier's' both had three stories in each issue. These were usually entertaining, and people really went for them. But then television came along, and now of course, information technology... the new way of killing time.": "Tom",
  "Whenever a new technology is introduced into society, there must be a counterbalancing human response - that is, high touch - or the technology is rejected... We must learn to balance the material wonders of technology with the spiritual demands of our human nature.": "John",
  "There's an ongoing competition by global companies across all areas from products, technology development and hiring talented people to patent disputes. The market is big and opportunities are wide open, so we should find out new businesses that Samsung's future will hinge on.": "Lee",
  "We are gods. Our tools make us gods. In symbiosis with our technology, our powers are expanding exponentially and so, too, our possibilities.": "Jason",
  "Technology is the means by which we have decommissioned natural selection and are seizing control. We are no longer to be victims of some blind evolutionary process where sentient beings are massacred by entropy.": "Jason",
  "Why should Congresspeople have to visit D.C.? Thanks to Skype, meetings are possible across the country. Thanks to email, communications are simple. And we've had the technology to vote from afar for decades. Why should we have backroom deals made over cigars thousands of miles distant from those who are affected by those deals?": "Ben",
  "It's a great time for independent media because technology reduces the entry barrier. It makes it a phenomenal time for media in general. It's David versus Goliath, and David is always a little smarter, more nimble, more fast.": "Sasa",
  "When Tim Berners-Lee invented the computer code that led to the creation of the World Wide Web in 1990, he did not try to patent or charge fees for the use of his technology.": "Rebecca",
  "Museums provide places of relaxation and inspiration. And most importantly, they are a place of authenticity. We live in a world of reproductions - the objects in museums are real. It's a way to get away from the overload of digital technology.": "Thomas",
  "One of the things you learn operating in the technology industry is disruptions are occurring every day.": "Dick",
  "The PC is successful because we're all benefiting from the competition with each other. If Twitter comes along, our games benefit. If Nvidia makes better graphics technology, all the games are going to shine. If we come out with a better game, people are going to buy more PCs.": "Gabe",
  "The NFL is a unique work place. There are no secrets anymore. Technology has taken over, and secrets are exposed. People are going to know what you're all about. You have to make sure you have real honesty in the work place, or you're going to be exposed.": "Andy",
  "Environmentalists should like fracking for its relative cleanliness. But they don't. They have made a bugaboo out of the chemicals in fracking fluids, which supposedly can leach into groundwater sources. I'm convinced they're dead wrong. Ultimately, good technology with a cost advantage will win out over paranoia.": "Kenneth",
  "Every time there's a new tool, whether it's Internet or cell phones or anything else, all these things can be used for good or evil. Technology is neutral; it depends on how it's used.": "Rick",
  "Spiraling demand for resources of which our world contains a finite supply is the great long-term threat posed by globalisation. That is why we need new technology to relieve it.": "Peter",
  "A country's economic growth may be defined as a long-term rise in capacity to supply increasingly diverse economic goods to its population, this growing capacity based on advancing technology and the institutional and ideological adjustments that it demands.": "Simon",
  "As technology advances, so too does terrorists' use of technology to communicate - both to inspire and recruit. The widespread use of technology propagates the persistent terrorist message to attack U.S. interests, whether in the homeland or abroad.": "James",
  "We often hear people talk about the concept of 'uberization,' where a new technology completely turns an industry on its head and forces us to rethink the way things have always been done. No industry will remain untouched by these forces.": "Klaus",
  "There's already a lot of active research going on using the Crispr technology to fix diseases like Duchenne muscular dystrophy or cystic fibrosis or Huntington's disease. They're all diseases that have known genetic causes, and we now have the technology that can repair those mutations to provide, we hope, patients with a normal life.": "Jennifer",
  "Every film that comes out that incorporates CGI or performance capture is a little bit ahead of the last film that came out. You're on the cutting edge for a certain amount of time, and then the new technology comes out.": "Ben",
  "Our philosophy is that we want to be an ecosystem. Our philosophy is to empower others to sell, empower others to service, making sure the other people are more powerful than us. With our technology, our innovation, our partners - 10 million small business sellers - they can compete with Microsoft and IBM.": "Jack",
  "To understand the future of technology, we need to begin with one fundamental truth: Technology is natural.": "Gray",
  "Technology will mirror the culture and the psychology creating it. We need new psychological scaffolding to work with. Less fear and more optimism.": "Gray",
  "Technology does not always rhyme with perfection and reliability. Far from it in reality!": "Jean-Michel",
  "When you think about it, media's the intersection of content and technology - it's all about storytelling, like photography and the camera.": "Bob",
  "It would appear that we have reached the limits of what it is possible to achieve with computer technology, although one should be careful with such statements, as they tend to sound pretty silly in 5 years.": "John",
  "If your goal is anything but profitability - if it's to be big, or to grow fast, or to become a technology leader - you'll hit problems.": "Michael",
  "Technology isn't the enemy, it is our ally, but only if we adopt a new model that puts people before profit. I realize that we seem far from that model, but I have seen it in action and it is a beautiful thing. So I'm not willing to give up yet. Hope is the last thing to die.": "Justin",
  "You used to have to sing and convey emotion, and now, well, technically you can do anything with technology. It sucks for music today, but that's why that old music feels so good to me.": "Christina",
  "I got so passionate about technology. Hacking to me was like a video game. It was about getting trophies. I just kept going on and on, despite all the trouble I was getting into, because I was hooked.": "Kevin",
  "When people come to Twitter and they want to express something in the world, the technology fades away. It's them writing a simple message and them knowing that people are going to see it.": "Jack",
  "No matter how much technology changes scouting, no matter how much free agency and big TV contracts change the business of baseball, I hope and pray that the heart of the game will never change.": "Pat",
  "We can't stop a baby in Africa from starving to death... but we can afford enough technology and weaponry to blow the world up a million times over.": "Paul",
  "There are still some natural forces that everybody understands. Technology and industry have distanced people from nature and magic and human values.": "Laura",
  "Technology is incredibly powerful. And in many ways, the sky is the limit in terms of what you can actually accomplish with the right science and the right technology. But to get there, you have to actually invest in R&D. And often that means you have to be willing to spend an awful lot in that R&D phase before you see the benefits.": "Ramez",
  "Technology itself is neither good nor bad. People are good or bad.": "Naveen",
  "Despite the Obama administration's proclaimed commitment to global Internet freedom, the executive branch is not transparent about the types and capabilities of surveillance technologies it is sourcing and purchasing - or about what other governments are purchasing the same technology.": "Rebecca",
  "The space elevator's not just another competitive technology, promoted by people who simply like the idea of diminishing the luster of the thrusters. It would open wide the doors to space.": "Seth",
  "The machine does not isolate man from the great problems of nature but plunges him more deeply into them.": "Antoine",
  "I am a geek dad, believe me. I've got my iPad with me; I've got my iPhone 4; I've got my Xbox. I love technology and I want to feel like I'm living in the future, and these devices help me feel that way.": "Dee",
  "The technology at the leading edge changes so rapidly that you have to keep current after you get out of school. I think probably the most important thing is having good fundamentals.": "Gordon",
  "The first footfalls on Mars will mark a historic milestone, an enterprise that requires human tenacity matched with technology to anchor ourselves on another world.": "Buzz",
  "It's so funny: whenever there's a new technology introduced, there's always this fear it's going to end entertainment as we know it. When records came around, they were going to be the end of live music. Nobody would ever want to go see live music again.": "Elvis",
  "I can't say I'm particularly happy about all the spam and the viruses and the equivalent that we see on the Net, but I think technology can deal with many of the problems that we're now seeing, whether it's filtering or whatever, and laws may help a lot.": "Vint",
  "Yet now we are faced with the sickening suspicion that technology has run ahead of us.": "Richard",
  "Technology is destructive only in the hands of people who do not realize that they are one and the same process as the universe.": "Alan",
  "We humans have a love-hate relationship with our technology. We love each new advance and we hate how fast our world is changing... The robots really embody that love-hate relationship we have with technology.": "Daniel",
  "People are so busy positioning themselves before the screen and talking on the damn cellphones, communicating, that we're not reading, and in fact we're not really communicating, either. We're not talking to each other. There's just all these screens and wires and technology in between.": "Lee",
  "The Web and new technology offer more opportunities to reach a world market at a lower price. Today, a person can start a business at home and reach the world market.": "Robert",
  "I don't know technology and engineering. I don't know accounting.": "Bernard",
  "Seriously, we are in the midst of the convergence of voice and data and that is challenging the infrastructure of the telephone companies. There are huge commercial interests in the basic technology, but even more so in content delivery and control of content.": "Steve",
  "Everybody has to be able to participate in a future that they want to live for. That's what technology can do.": "Dean",
  "The Mac defined 'personal technology', and the iPhone defines 'intimate technology' as a convergence of communications, content and location.": "John",
  "While the rest of the world has been improving technology, Ghana has been improving the quality of man's humanity to man.": "Maya",
  "Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking of them.": "Alfred",
  "It is only when they go wrong that machines remind you how powerful they are.": "Clive",
  "We want to build technology that everybody loves using, and that affects everyone. We want to create beautiful, intuitive services and technologies that are so incredibly useful that people use them twice a day. Like they use a toothbrush. There aren't that many things people use twice a day.": "Larry",
  "Technology sometimes gets a bad rap because of certain consequences that it's had on the environment and unforeseen problems, but we shouldn't use it as an excuse to reject our tools; rather, we should decide that we need to make better tools to solve the problems caused by the initial tools in a progressive wave of innovation.": "Jason",
  "There are many museums dedicated to technology, artistic endeavors, music, and that sort of thing. From that perspective, I think games really do have a place as a kind of collaborative art or a synthesis of all these various aspects into a whole, and that, in itself, can be perceived as art.": "Hideo",
  "I don't care about the internal political system of the United States. I want to be a friend of United States, of its baseball, its institutions, its rock and roll, its workers, and its technology because we need it. I want to be friends of the Arab people, of the Persian people, of the Asian people.": "Hugo",
  "Technology is making gestures precise and brutal, and with them men.": "Theodor",
  "It's impossible to move, to live, to operate at any level without leaving traces, bits, seemingly meaningless fragments of personal information.": "William",

  "For a successful technology, reality must take precedence over public relations, for Nature cannot be fooled.": "Richard",
  "Despite our ever-connective technology, neither Skype nor Facebook - not even a telephone call - can come close to the joy of being with loved ones in person.": "Marlo",
  "I really believe that we don't have to make a trade-off between security and privacy. I think technology gives us the ability to have both.": "John",
  "If you think about brewing, it is biotechnology. And I would say that I was a technologist at heart. So whether I... fermented beer or whether I fermented enzymes, the base technology was the same.": "Kiran",
  "I just invent, then wait until man comes around to needing what I've invented.": "R.",
  "It is definitely true that the fundamental enabling technology for electric cars is lithium-ion as a cell chemistry technology. In the absence of that, I don't think it's possible to make an electric car that is competitive with a gasoline car.": "Elon",
  "Technology has become as ubiquitous as the air we breathe, so we are no longer conscious of its presence.": "Godfrey",
  "I've always wanted to own and control the primary technology in everything we do.": "Steve",
  "I go and see anything that's visually new, any technology that's about picture-making. The technology won't make the pictures different, but someone using it will.": "David",
  "It's hard to say exactly what it is about face-to-face contact that makes deals happen, but whatever it is, it hasn't yet been duplicated by technology.": "Paul",
  "An awful lot of successful technology companies ended up being in a slightly different market than they started out in. Microsoft started with programming tools, but came out with an operating system. Oracle started doing contracts for the CIA. AOL started out as an online video gaming network.": "Marc",
  "Technology is notorious for engrossing people so much that they don't always focus on balance and enjoy life at the same time.": "Paul",
  "Technology challenges us to assert our human values, which means that first of all, we have to figure out what they are.": "Sherry",
  "There are moments of opportunity for families moments they need to put technology away. These include: no phones or texting during meals. No phones or texting when parents pick up children at school - a child is looking to make eye contact with a parent!": "Sherry",
  "I was nerdy girl who went to Catholic school and wanted to be an engineer. I was all set to attend the Illinois Institute of Technology. And then I took a hard left turn and studied Liberal Arts at Northern Illinois University, majored in Communications. Then worked in radio as a disk jockey and as the weather girl.": "Cindy",
  "I always get sick of these conversations where people are so obsessed with pixels, with high definition, and even with technology in general. I find it just dull and heartless. And so I wanted to use only the worst machines.": "Harmony",

  "Microsoft isn't evil, they just make really crappy operating systems.": "Linus",

  "Every aspect of human technology has a dark side, including the bow and arrow.": "Margaret",

  "Wouldn't it be great if the technology we used to take care of ourselves was as good as the technology we use to make money?": "James",
  "I'm always working on new songs. With the technology these days, any idiot can record on Pro Tools on your laptop. All you have to do is plug a microphone into the input jack and anybody can have their own recording studio.

  "I think that technology is the best thing that ever happened to mankind. It's an absurd notion that somehow, 'My God, what are we going to do when driverless cars come along?'

  "AI might be a powerful technology, but things won't get better simply by adding AI.": "Vivienne",
  "Technology has a shadow side. It accounts for real progress in medicine, but has also hurt it in many ways, making it more impersonal, expensive and dangerous. The false belief that a safety net of sophisticated drugs and machines stretches below us, permitting risky or lazy lifestyle choices, has undermined our spirit of self-reliance.": "Andrew",
  "Technology no longer consists just of hardware or software or even services, but of communities. Increasingly, community is a part of technology, a driver of technology, and an emergent effect of technology.": "Howard",
  "We had to address information technology in the ways we had not before and give the agents the tools that they need to do their job more efficiently and more expeditiously.": "Robert",

  "We need a wireless mobile device ecosystem that mirrors the PC/Internet ecosystem, one where the consumers' purchase of network capacity is separate from their purchase of the hardware and software they use on that network. It will take government action, or some disruptive technology or business innovation, to get us there.": "Walt",

  "In the smart home of the future, there should be a robot designed to talk to you. With enough display technology, connectivity, and voice recognition, this human-interface robot or head-of-household robot will serve as a portal to the digital domain. It becomes your interface to your robot-enabled home.": "Colin",
  "Technology may create a condition, but the questions are what do we do about ourselves. We better understand ourselves pretty clearly and we better find ways to like ourselves.": "Herbert",
  "We must speed up the deployment of broadband in order to bring high-speed data services to homes and businesses. The spread of information technology has contributed to a steady growth in U.S. productivity.": "Michael",

  "As part of our layered approach, we have expedited the deployment of new Advanced Imaging Technology (AIT) units to help detect concealed metallic and non-metallic threats on passengers. These machines are now in use at airports nationwide, and the vast majority of travelers say they prefer this technology to alternative screening measures.": "Janet",
  "All images generated by imaging technology are viewed in a walled-off location not visible to the public. The officer assisting the passenger never sees the image, and the officer viewing the image never interacts with the passenger.

  "Advances in the technology of telecommunications have proved an unambiguous threat to totalitarian regimes everywhere.": "Rupert",
  "I love what the Valley does. I love company building. I love startups. I love technology companies. I love new technology. I love this process of invention.

  "With the world's human population now at seven billion and growing, and the demand for technology and modern conveniences increasing, we can't control all our negative impacts. But we have to find better ways to live within the limits nature and its cycles impose.": "David",
  "Technologists provide tools that can improve people's lives. But I want to be clear that I don't think technology by itself improves people's lives, since often I'm criticized for being too pro-technology. Unless there's commensurate ethical and moral improvements to go along with it, it's for naught.": "Jaron",
  "And so when I moved to IBM, I moved because I thought I could apply technology. I didn't actually have to do my engineer - I was an electrical engineer, but I could apply it. And that was when I changed. And when I got there, though, I have to say, at the time, I really never felt there was a constraint about being a woman. I really did not.": "Ginni",
  "Not since the digital revolution in the early '90s has technology placed such a comprehensive burden on business, employees and individuals to reinvent their business plans, services and products, and themselves to keep pace with the changing marketplace.": "Simon",
  "It is the child's understanding that teaches the adults the way of the future. They're still doing it today with modern technology.": "Michael",
  "I think 99 percent of women's lib comes from technology making different kinds of lives possible, and then the social adjustment follows the technology - it doesn't precede it.": "Lois",
  "I have a grandson who is 20. He's a computer guy. I'm worried that he can't communicate without his machine. They have no personal contact with people. That's the bad part of technology.": "Penny",

  "There was a study done in the early 20th century of all the entrepreneurs who entered the automobile industry around the same time as Henry Ford; there were something like 500 automotive companies that got funded, had the internal combustion engine, had the technology, and had the vision. Sixty percent of them folded within a couple of years.": "Eric",
  "All of the people who are using their BlackBerries or their iPhones, Facebook, all of the people who are sitting in cafes and hotels rooms doing their work, they're all using wireless technology, and we shouldn't assume that the only way of the future is high speed cable.": "Tony",
  "All the big revolutions, whether it's the Industrial Revolution, the Arab Spring, those changes happened by economic and social shifts brought about by the people's voices, and those things weren't voted for. Most of our changes today are brought about through technology, not by voting.": "Lupe",
  "We have to wonder whether digital technology, rather than making it easier to communicate, is actually doing the opposite. We now sit alone at a keyboard, firing off zeros and ones into the ether. Offices are silent.": "Tom",
  "I feel there is so much more we can do in improving education, making it accessible and understanding how technology can be a part of the solution.": "Jim",
  "The biggest challenge for cyborgs is to be socially accepted. Society needs to accept that there are people who wish to use technology as part of the body.": "Neil",
  "Our technologised society is becoming opaque. As technology becomes more ubiquitous and our relationship with digital devices ever more seamless, our technical infrastructure seems to be increasingly intangible.": "Honor",
  "I wouldn't say you have an online life and a real life. I think technology is just mapping and organizing what already exists.": "Ashton",

  "My only worry about tweeting and modern technology is how it has crept into even the darkest corners of the absolute global village we live in.": "Denis",
  "I think the Internet and technology in general has changed everything. We can see it overseas even more with the Arab Spring and so forth.": "Jane",
  "Disabled people need more invested in their education, housing, job training, transportation, assistive technology, and independent-living facilities. Governments earn back this investment - and more - by making people with disabilities economically productive citizens.": "Jesse",
  "Every young person gets so excited about new software packages and new technology.": "John",
  "Of course, mankind would not have landed on the Moon in 1969, were it not for two things: conquered Nazi rocket technology and post-war anti-Communist paranoia in the United States.": "Charles",
  "I love technology. Matches, to light a fire, is really high tech. The wheel is really one of the great inventions of all time. Other than that, I am an ignoramus about technology.": "William",
  "Modern technology has taken the angst out of achieving the perfect shot. For me, the only thing that counts is the idea behind the image: what you want to see and what you're trying to say. The idea is crucial. You have to think of something you want to say and expand upon it.": "Martin",
  "About every year or two, there is a moment of truth where there's some new development in the marketplace, some new technology, some sort of existential crisis. You just have to be vigilant about looking out for those moments.": "Jeremy",
  "Software substitution, whether it's for drivers or waiters or nurses - it's progressing. Technology over time will reduce demand for jobs, particularly at the lower end of skill set.": "Bill",
  "Our first challenge is to ensure safety of pilgrims, and we will use modern technology for that. We will strengthen our telecom network and will provide special mobile apps to the pilgrims at the time of registration.": "Harish",
  "I'm trying my best to keep up with all this new technology, and I surround myself with all these wonderful people that are in the know and kind of help me out with all that.": "Dolly",
  "China is a great manufacturing center, but it's actually mostly an assembly plant. So it assembles parts and components, high technology that comes from the surrounding industrial - more advanced industrial centers - Japan, Taiwan, South Korea, Singapore, the United States, Europe - and it basically assembles them.": "Noam",
  "Just as computer technology and the Internet created whole new industries and extraordinary benefits for people that extend into almost every realm of human endeavor from education to transportation to medicine, genetics will undoubtedly benefit people everywhere in ways we can't even imagine but know will surely occur.": "Anne",
  "You just have to adapt, and you have to realize where people are going to actually play their games. It used to just be Nintendo and PlayStation, and now it's all kind of devices. So you've got to learn to adapt what you know from the technology into those areas... I've been wanting to do a mobile game for a long time.": "Tony",
  "Grassroots techies - the mostly unknown people who write code and start companies that don't make the headlines - hate, loathe, and despise Microsoft. At technology conferences, it is the devil, or the guaranteed laugh line. Its products are mocked, its business practices booed.": "Virginia",
  "We have already discovered how quickly we become dependent on the Internet and its applications for business, government and research, so it is not surprising that we are finding that we can apply this technology to enable or facilitate our social interactions as well.": "Vint",
  "It is time to stop debating whether the Internet is an effective tool for political expression and instead to address the much more urgent question of how digital technology can be structured, governed, and used to maximize the good and minimize the evil.": "Rebecca",
  "My father taught us that to thrive, excellence in technology, quality, and customer service along with cost competitiveness is a prerequisite. His contribution to business, the economy, and society at large can never be underscored enough.": "Kumar",
  "Even technology companies get good news sometimes.": "Alex",
  "I think that for all of the dangers of technology spreading, I think it is more dangerous in some ways that it doesn't. My simple reason for that is we've got 7 billion people on the planet, and we have these very serious problems, and I think we don't know who's going to have the answers to the problems that are coming around the bend.": "Daniel",
  "Our children will outwit us if they want; for when it comes to technology, they hold the higher ground. Unlike other tools passed carefully and ceremonially from one generation to the next - the sharp scissors, the car keys - this is one they understand better than we do.": "Nancy",
  "I think we're heading towards a world of what I call 'technological socialism.' Where technology - not the government or the state - will begin to take care of us. Technology will provide our healthcare for free. The best education in the world - for free.": "Peter",
  "Innovation and disruption are the hallmarks of the technology world, and hardly a moment passes when we are not thinking, doing, or talking about these topics.": "Steven",
  "When someone takes their existing business and tries to transform it into something else - they fail. In technology that is often the case. Look at Kodak: it was the dominant imaging company in the world. They did fabulously during the great depression, but then wiped out the shareholders because of technological change.": "Charlie",
  "Once upon a time, sound was new technology.": "Peter",
  "It's a mistake to believe technology rests outside India. We compete very successfully.": "Adi",
  "My friend created an iPhone app that locates Vienna Beef products across the country. Personally, I came hardwired with an internal GPS that instinctively points me toward coffee shops, cupcake stores and the perfect Chicago-style dog, so I find this technology redundant.": "Jen",
  "Technology moves so fast and social media moves so fast because everyone wants the new thing, but also, everyone wants to be where their parents are not. Once the mom got a Facebook and a Twitter and an Instagram, I don't want to be there anymore.": "Ansel",
  "We no longer think of chairs as technology; we just think of them as chairs. But there was a time when we hadn't worked out how many legs chairs should have, how tall they should be, and they would often 'crash' when we tried to use them.": "Douglas",

  "Doing exercise without monitoring yourself will be rare in the future of wearable technology.": "Astro",
  "Technology is characterized by constant change, rapid innovation, creative destruction, and revolutionary products.": "Marsha",
  "For me, it matters that we drive technology as an equalizing force, as an enabler for everyone around the world. Which is why I do want Google to see, push, and invest more in making sure computing is more accessible, connectivity is more accessible.": "Sundar",
  "We're building what I call 'software apartheid.' We're in the process of creating a divided society: those who can use technology on one side, and those who can't on the other. And it happens to divide neatly along economic lines.": "Alan",
  "As hardware doubles its density every 18-24 months, courtesy of Moore's Law, and as software eats the world, technology will replace a broad swathe of jobs outright - from burger-flippers to diagnosticians - and atomize many others from full-time positions into gigs performed by many fungible workers. Tech, in short, will eat jobs.": "Jon",
  "The period 1924 to 1929 was spent studying chemistry at the Czech Institute of Technology in Prague, Czechoslovakia. The supervisor of my thesis was Professor Emil Votocek, one of the prominent founders of chemical research in Czechoslovakia.": "Vladimir",
  "First, how do we give everyone a fair shot at opportunity and security in this new economy? Second, how do we make technology work for us, and not against us - especially when it comes to solving urgent challenges like climate change? Third, how do we keep America safe and lead the world without becoming its policeman?": "Barack",
  "Technology is going to revolutionize almost every sector, leading to the demise of many traditional professions. Economic and political power will be determined less by a country's size than by its technological superiority.": "Klaus",
  "The CIA in real life, we know, is looking for new kinds of cover. It's looking for new platforms, as they like to say, and it's trying to use the revolution in communications technology, the ability to use all sorts of corporate entities in ways that are hard to detect to get our spies in the places where they need to be.": "David",
  "Technology is changing the world it's changing our sport. It's changing the way people are following the NBA. ": "Adam",
  "The biggest invention of modern time is the book. The book is a digital medium; book text is written in a different form and replicable. What it really does is it allows us to replicate cultural information, scientific technology, and information out of the human brain.": "Sebastian",
  "Instead of serving special interests, Congress should focus on the big picture. Globalization and technology have completely reshaped our economy in recent decades, and if we don't respond, we're putting the future of the middle class at risk.": "John",
  "I know we're all addicted to our smartphones, and I'll say, if I forget my smartphone, I go home and get it. And so understanding how to integrate that technology into the driving experience, both the front seat and the passenger seat and the back seat, I think is very important.": "Mary",
  "Great songwriting will never die - it's in the DNA of music - but what's new and exciting is pairing that with new sounds that technology is enabling us to make.": "Flume",
  "CIA relies on a partner's focus, linguistic agility, and cultural depth; in return, the partner benefits from CIA's resources, technology, and global view.": "Michael",
  "The combination of human skills with technology will always be at the root of any solution to the future of making clothes.": "Issey",
  "It's counterproductive to lower my price, because I have to sell more units to make up for that lost revenue. Generating brand-new products can take a long time. Improving service is typically the quickest way that I can take market share. So aligning technology strategy to better service customers becomes an essential path to revenue growth.": "Mark",
  "Discipline may be identified neither with an institution nor with an apparatus; it is a type of power, a modality for its exercise, comprising a whole set of instruments, techniques, procedures, levels of application, targets; it is a 'physics' or 'anatomy' of power, a technology.": "Michel",
  "The introduction of new technology is always disruptive to existing markets, particularly to content/copyright owners who sell through well-established distribution channels.": "Steve",
  "Technology certainly is going faster. Dynamics on the battlefield are faster. And so, I think you do need, you know, a warrior that is adept in technology, you know, certainly skilled.": "Ryan",
  "Citadel is a global technology leader, recognized for its work to level the playing field for investors and make markets more fair, transparent and efficient. I look forward to leading this exemplary team as we grow this global business.": "B.",
  "A lot of the problems in the mortgage world, people said, were because our competitors were evil. But a lot of it was a lack of technology - bad processes and systems.": "Dan",
  "If every company becomes a technology company, business models and transitions are going to occur. From a CEO's perspective, this is going to be the biggest technology transition of all times.": "John",
  "Since Graham Bell came up with telephony, it took 100 years for the way the technology has impacted our lives, the way we perceive the world.": "Shiv",

  "Like all tools, modern technology has produced some wonderful moments in music and also some horrors.": "Hugh",
  "Technology has changed the fan/actor interaction quite a bit. Now it's really easy to communicate with a large group of people in a really short time, and that... opens a lot of possibilities. You can do a lot of things with it that you couldn't do before. It's kind of fun to figure out how that can be employed.": "Misha",
  "I would absolutely love to go back to the simplicity of the '80s, where there wasn't texting, social media, iPhones, or smartphones. I love the fact that you would go home and check your messages. I'm not well suited to the world of modern technology.": "Matthew",
  "As technology improves, on-screen avatars look more and more like real people. When they start looking too real, though, we pull away. These almost-humans aren't quite right; they look creepy, like zombies.": "James",
  "Technology breeds crime and we are constantly trying to develop technology to stay one step ahead of the person trying to use it negatively.": "Frank",
  "Today, our attention is less than the television advertisement. We're looking at six or seven problems constantly. We're living in the disturbed societies of cities. I think modern technology is one of the worst things human beings have invented.": "Marina",
  "CCTV is seen either as a symbol of Orwellian dystopia or a technology that will lead to crime-free streets and civil behaviour. While arguments continue, there is very little solid data in the public domain about the costs, quantity and effectiveness of surveillance.": "Heather",
  "One of the things that has happened with technology is that it can only be helpful if it is useful, of course, but it can only be helpful too if it's accessible, and it can only be helpful if it's affordable.": "Hector",
  "When I took my first job, I was among only a handful of women. It was isolating at times. My love for technology kept me going, and I got to where I am today driven by my passion and self confidence.": "Padmasree",
  "In 1970, there was a single telephone company in the United States called AT&T, and its technology was called circuit switching, and that was all any telecom engineer worried about.": "Vint",
  "If women want to ensure themselves a meaningful place in the future, they need to be among those determining how the technology will be used. They need to be among those deciding whether it will be the great leveler or simply serve to worsen social divisions.": "Anita",
  "I'm guilty of being fascinated by gadgets and toys and technology, but any penny that I spend, I try to make it be a part of what I do for a living. Because then you are forwarding. You are forwarding that art, forwarding that career ahead.": "Jeff",
  "Back in the days of Apollo, sending humans to the moon was the only viable way to get the scientific data we wanted. But now, with our computer and robotics technology, there's very little an astronaut can do on Mars that a well-designed rover can't.": "Andy",
  "I don't think that technology is going to allow for greater subjugation of people. I think it's gonna give them more freedom.": "Palmer",
  "The evolution of technology is, like the evolution of literature, heavily path-dependent. Culture plays a far more important role in the acceptance, adoption, and spread of technology than many of us are willing to acknowledge.": "Ken",

  "I understand Twitter has become popular among politicians. This technology allows them to stay in perpetual contact with their constituents. The electorate now has instant information about what politicians have been up to.": "P.",
  "Consulting offered me an opportunity to see a lot of different businesses in different regions of the world, to see how textiles were being affected by foreign competition, how technology was changing.": "Mitt",
  "I can tell you, Obamacare, I have been stunned by the pratfalls associated with its implementation. I simply can't understand how a president that had such an effective technology campaign and has such support among the technology community members could have put in place the implementation of Obamacare as ineffectively as he did.": "Mitt",
  "I'm sorry, it's true. Having children really changes your view on these things. We're born, we live for a brief instant, and we die. It's been happening for a long time. Technology is not changing it much - if at all.": "Steve",

  "Science - or the products of science like technology - is just a way of achieving something real, something that happens, something that works.": "Richard",

  "Even when you take a holiday from technology, technology doesn't take a break from you.": "Douglas",
  "When you think about Twitter and you think what a dumb stupid throwaway technology, and then you have the Iranian elections and it actually saves the day - you can't prejudge technologies now because they have effects you may not have intended.": "Douglas",
  "Whatever it is that leads human beings to hate, to destroy, and to kill has taken on a collective force like never before, as technology and globalization now give it the capacity to not just strike, but to strike us all, together, as one.": "Marianne",
  "My vision is for a fully reusable rocket transport system between Earth and Mars that is able to re-fuel on Mars - this is very important - so you don't have to carry the return fuel when you go there.": "Elon",
  "If you look at our current technology level, something strange has to happen to civilisations, and I mean strange in a bad way. And it could be that there are a whole lot of dead, one-planet civilisations.": "Elon",
  "Government isn't that good at rapid advancement of technology. It tends to be better at funding basic research. To have things take off, you've got to have commercial companies do it.": "Elon",
  "A big reason why I started writing is I felt that fiction had stopped evolving. All other entertainments were getting better, constantly, as technology allowed. Movies. Video games. Music.": "Chuck",
  "I am amazed at the wonders of technology and am grateful for the ways in which we are able to use it to share the Gospel around the world.": "Billy",
  "The Oklahoma City bombing was simple technology, horribly used. The problem is not technology. The problem is the person or persons using it.": "Billy",
  "Technology is such a broad kind of term, it really applies to so many things, from the electric light to running cars on oil. All of these different things can be called technology. I have kind of a love-hate relationship with it, as I expect most people do. With the computer, I spend so many hours sitting in front of a computer.": "Jeff",
  "Normally, I love to go to the movies and when I see a character portrayed by different actors at different ages, it kind of pops a little bit for me. It brings me out of the movie experience. Now we have the technology to cure that.": "Jeff",

  "I think that people would like to, at all times, reject death and disease with technology.": "Alejandro",
  "If technology and medicine are used by women to have children or not to have children or to have healthier children - that's one thing. But if it's used to say, 'You're not a real woman unless you have a child; therefore, take all these dangerous hormones and have one at 54,' then it's another story.": "Gloria",

  "In '83, not only was there no such thing as performance motion capture technology, there was no such thing as digital animation. This was the analog era.": "Steven",

  "It seems obvious that if a species has the brainpower for speech, along with the sort of appendages that can manipulate a pair of pliers, it will eventually blunder into science, technology, and radio.": "Seth",
  "It used to be that the only ones with access to cutting-edge technology were top government labs, big companies and the ultra-rich. It was simply too expensive for the rest of us to afford.": "Peter",

  "Wal-Mart uses technology to increase sales volume, but the more it does so, the more it drives down profit margins - its own and everybody else's. The same logic does not appear to hold for Goldman Sachs.": "Timothy",
  "'Operation Ajax' presents history in an entirely new way. It takes a true story and uses cutting-edge technology, never before used in this way, to bring it to spectacular life.": "Stephen",
  "The millennials were raised in a cocoon, their anxious parents afraid to let them go out in the park to play. So should we be surprised that they learned to leverage technology to build community, tweeting and texting and friending while their elders were still dialing long-distance?": "Nancy",
  "In practice, downsizing is too often about cutting your work force while keeping your business the same, and doing so not by investments in productivity-enhancing technology, but by making people pull 80-hour weeks and bringing in temps to fill the gap.": "James",
  "I like connecting with people through technology.": "Theophilus",
  "We humans usually feel that we are the best at everything we do, that we can safely drive ourselves. But tens of thousands of people die every year. We need to be open to having technology assist us, to find ways in which technology makes us safer.": "Sebastian",
  "What I found personally to be true was that it's easier to manipulate people rather than technology.": "Kevin",
  "My initial desire to blog came from something that's always been my approach to investing - I'm a nerd, and I love to play with the technology, and part of my approach has really been to understand things both at a user level and at a reasonably deep tentacle level.": "Brad",
  "Technology is huge; I wanted to learn about it. People might say that's odd, but I think it's odd if artists aren't interested in the world around them. I'm always chasing that.": "Bono",

  "The benefits of our increasingly digital lives have been accompanied by new dangers, and we have been forced to consider how criminals and terrorists might use advances in technology to their advantage.": "James",
  "Digital technology is both arousing and distancing. We don't look at the users on the other side as people. They aren't - they're just usernames, Facebook photos and Twitter handles.": "Douglas",
  "I am much less concerned with whatever it is technology may be doing to people that what people are choosing to do to one another through technology. Facebook's reduction of people to predictively modeled profiles and investment banking's convolution of the marketplace into an algorithmic battleground were not the choices of machines.": "Douglas",
  "There's absolutely no bubble in technology.": "Peter",
  "If the whole U.S. was like Silicon Valley, we'd be in good shape. But now, the entire U.S. is not driven by technology, is not driven by innovation.": "Peter",
  "I don't feel that this concept of disruptive technology is the solution for everybody. But I think it's very important for innovators to understand what we've learned about established companies' motivation to target obvious profitable markets - and about their inability to find emerging ones. The evidence is just overwhelming.": "Clayton",
  "The arc of technology is in the direction of unbreakable encryption, and no laws are going to get in the way of that reality.": "Michael",
  "If you had a really good - battery, it wouldn't matter that the sun goes down at night and the wind stops blowing sometimes. But at the moment, battery technology is nowhere near good enough to use at utility scale.": "Nathan",
  "The depressing thing about battery technology is that it gets better, but it gets better slowly. There are a whole bunch of problems in materials science and chemistry that come in trying to make existing batteries better.": "Nathan",
  "The promise of the early web was that everyone could have a website but there was something missing. Maybe the technology wasn't ready.": "Matt",

  "Steve Jobs was notoriously blunt about products he found wanting, but his attack on Flash - Adobe's popular technology for playing multimedia content inside a browser - was particularly vicious. Claiming it was buggy and insecure, Jobs banned it from the iPad.": "Evgeny",
  "The technology available for film-making now is incredible, but I am a big believer that it's all in the story.": "Robert",
  "After Scour, I started a company called Red Swoosh. The idea was to take those litigants who sued us for a huge amount of money and turn them into customers with the same technology. I wanted to get them to pay me. It was a revenge business.": "Travis",

  "I think that we're on a path that Apple was determined to be on since the '70s, which was to try and make technology relevant and personal.": "Jonathan",
  "It's easy to get sidetracked with technology, and that is the danger, but ultimately you have to see what works with the music and what doesn't. In a lot of cases, less is more. In most cases, less is more.": "Herbie",
  "Making sounds that literally no one has ever heard before because the software and the technology's never been there, and pairing that with great songwriting, then that's what's exciting for me. That's what I wanna do.": "Flume",
  "My first job was as a programmer. So I feel like I'm familiar with the information technology sector and the information technology culture.": "Gene",
  "I think extreme secrecy is a bad sign in all startups. Very few startups die because they tell you exactly how their technology works. On the long list of startup killers, that's pretty far down. Though on the list of entrepreneur fears, it's pretty high.": "Sam",
  "We have promised to support India in its international aspiration. We have agreed to set up a working group on technology.": "Viktor",
  "I used to do my best thinking while staring out airplane windows. The seat-back video system put a stop to that. Now I sit and watch old' Friends' and 'Everybody Loves Raymond' episodes. Walking is good, but here again, technology has interfered. I like to listen to iTunes while I walk home. I guess I don't think anymore.": "Mary",
  "Because of technology, we don't develop telepathy. We don't use telepathy, but use, you know, the mobile phones. Why?": "Marina",
  "If you really want to improve technology, if you want things to work better and be better, you've got to protect the person who spends a lot of effort, money, and time developing that new technology.": "James",
  "The wonderful thing about Apple technology is just how intuitive it is.": "James",
  "We understand how to build and manage businesses that involve technology, engineering, and people at a large scale on a global platform.": "Azim",
  "The reason steampunk attracts people is that it is premised on a technology which is visible and pleasing to the naked eye, and whose moving parts are comprehensible on a human scale.": "Nick",
  "Steampunk appeals to the idea of uniqueness, to the one-off item, while every mainstream consumer technology of recent years is about putting human beings into ever more granular, packageable and mass-produced identities so that they can be sold or sold to, perfectly mapped and understood.": "Nick",
  "The spending in science and technology need to be to increased.": "Atal",
  "Wearable technology will tell us how well we are sleeping and whether we need to exercise. Sensors in the street will help us avoid traffic jams and find parking. Telemedicine applications will allow physicians to treat patients who are hundreds of miles away.": "John",
  "Once you understand that Goliath is much weaker than you think he is, and David has superior technology, then you say: why do we tell the story the way we do? It becomes, actually, a far more meaningful and important story in its retelling than in the kind of unsophisticated way we've done it for, I think, too long.": "Malcolm",
  "Bringing buyers and sellers together through a single platform is not a new idea - most of us know about eBay's success - but with advancing technology comes new innovative methods for businesses to connect customers with those who want to offer services.": "Sam",
  "I'm interested in Linux because of the technology, and Linux wasn't started as any kind of rebellion against the 'evil Microsoft empire.'": "Linus",
  "Being a club pro and all, a guy trying to keep up with golf's modern technology, I hadn't found much time for Internet dating, but then one day I knew I'd met the girl of my dreams when she replied to a comment I'd made on You-and-Me.com. She said, 'I love it when you talk equipment to me.'": "Dan",
  "Technology allows us to do many things, but it is always important to combine it with traditional handcrafts and, in fact, use technology to replicate dying arts so that they are not lost.": "Issey",
  "All of the books in the world contain no more information than is broadcast as video in a single large American city in a single year. Not all bits have equal value.": "Carl",
  "We speak of 'software eating the world,' 'the Internet of Things,' and we massify 'data' by declaring it 'Big.' But these concepts remain for the most part abstract. It's hard for many of us to grasp the impact of digital technology on the 'real world' of things like rocks, homes, cars, and trees. We lack a metaphor that hits home.": "John",
  "We are led by lawyers who do not understand either technology or balance sheets.": "Thomas",
  "Product management really is the fusion between technology, what engineers do - and the business side.": "Marissa",
  "I don't understand it and haven't understood in this world of technology: where every building has a camera, every ATM has a camera, why don't we have cameras on police officers?": "Rick",
  "Technology is neutral and sterile. Now, technology is the nature of modern man; it is our environment and our horizon. Of course, every work of man is a negation of nature, but at the same time, it is a bridge between nature and us. Technology changes nature in a more radical and decisive manner: it throws it out.": "Octavio",
  "All of technology, really, is about maximizing free options.": "Nassim",
  "The Internet allows the small guy a global marketplace. But technology is harmful in the sense that we get too much information from it. Because of the web we get 10 times the amount of noise we ever got, which makes harmful fallacies far more likely.": "Nassim",
  "Technology has the benefit of being easily scalable. A few weeks or months of coding can result in solutions that reap huge benefits. The global success of Facebook, Twitter, and Google are all triumphs of technology.": "Shawn",
  "There is a lack of talent in technology, and we need to be encouraging kids in school to learn how to code. We need to encourage computer science as a major. We need to encourage entrepreneurism.": "Jon",
  "I started in comics in 2005, ten years ago, and at that time, I didn't have a cell phone. I don't even think I had a computer myself, you know. And just in those ten years, how much technology has changed.": "Jeff",
  "I love technology - yes, I have fallen in love with older cars, but I'm all for new technology.": "Mario",
  "I'm equally guilty of using technology - I Twitter, I text people, I chat. But I think there's something strangely insidious about it that it makes us think we're closer when in fact we're not seeing each other, we're not connecting.": "Jason",
  "YouTube is akin to having my own network.": "Marlee",
  "We can't blame the technology when we make mistakes.": "Tim",
  "American women are so fortunate. When I got married, all I wanted in the world was a dryer so I didn't have to hang up my diapers. And now women have paper diapers and all sorts of conveniences in the home. And it is the man and the technology that has made the home such a pleasant place for women to be.": "Phyllis",
  "When you consider that our technology has advanced from the first telephones to smart phones in roughly a century, it's easy to understand why it seems like tomorrow is arriving faster than it ever did.": "Annalee",

  "It is questionable if all the mechanical inventions yet made have lightened the day's toil of any human being.": "John",
  "It's important with any new technology to try to pay conscious attention to what the drawbacks might be. We choose to multitask. Sometimes our choices aren't the wisest of choices, and we regret them, but they are our choices. I think it'd be wrong to think that they're automatically bad.": "James",
  "Every time a new technology comes along, we feel we're about to break through to a place where we will not be able to recover. The advent of broadcast radio confused people. It delighted people, of course, but it also changed the world.": "James",
  "The core concept of Samasource is essentially that technology helps us unlock human talent wherever it may happen to reside. That we should no longer be victims of the birth lottery. That no one should be stuck in a poor place where they don't have a job simply because of an accident of birth.": "Leila",
  "Civilization has given us enormous successes: going to the moon, technology. But then this is the civilisation that took us to debt, environmental crisis, every single crisis. We need a civilization where we say goodbye to these things.": "Muhammad",
  "People gravitate to what they believe to be popular... Technology is enabling even more of that.": "Bob",
  "Technology teaches passivity. Absorbed in our devices - at any age - we are absorbed in someone else's perspective.": "Julia",
  "Libraries function as crucial technology hubs, not merely for free Web access, but those who need computer training and assistance. Library business centers help support entrepreneurship and retraining.": "Scott",
  "For the blue-collar worker, the driving force behind change was factory automation using programmable machine tools. For the office worker, it's office automation using computer technology: enterprise-resource-planning systems, groupware, intranets, extranets, expert systems, the Web, and e-commerce.": "Tom",
  "In the technology world, you have to execute fast or you're out of business.": "Vivek",
  "Ask any venture capitalist, and they will tell you that they consider the experience and completeness of the founding team to be a more important factor in their investment decision than the technology that is being built.": "Vivek",
  "Police departments no longer have to pay overtime or divert resources from other projects to find out where an individual goes - all they have to do is place a tracking device on someone's car or ask a cell phone company for that individual's location history and the technology does the work for them.": "Ron",
  "I can't live without my smartphone, but I really geek on coding. It's not so much technology that I like, but puzzle solving.": "Sylvia",
  "A moderate tax on robots, even a temporary tax that merely slows the adoption of disruptive technology, seems a natural component of a policy to address rising inequality. Revenue could be targeted toward wage insurance, to help people replaced by new technology make the transition to a different career.": "Robert",
  "What makes the production of my work so expensive? The whole installation thing - the construction, the objects, the technology. It really adds up.": "Barbara",
  "There is technology where you can watch the match live online and also on TV. If people understood the game, I'm sure we would have a lot of chess fans by now.": "Viswanathan",
  "Creative people are notoriously the slowest to adopt new technology.": "Robert",
  "Once anthropology and geology had opened up the pre-recordkeeping darkness of humanity's long, slow, sustained infancy as suitable grounds for speculation, writers began trying to imagine human existence as it must have been with only stone-age technology.": "Paul",
  "The mandate for the CTO's office is to unleash the power of technology, data, and innovation on behalf of the nation. The CTO's office is really trying to bring best practices, possibilities, pilots, and policy advising.": "Megan",
  "Television has changed the American child from an irresistable force to an immovable object.": "Laurence",
  "Style used to be an interaction between the human soul and tools that were limiting. In the digital era, it will have to come from the soul alone.": "Jaron",
  "Advertisers are not thinking radically enough - they look for technology to lead instead of trying the neuroscience approach and thinking about what parts of the brain haven't been activated before. These new experiences bring new capabilities to the brain.": "Jaron",
  "What does it mean to not be alone? I've approached that question through music, technology, writing and other means.": "Jaron",
  "The latest technology is not always good for anything except to the producers of the technology.": "Wendell",
  "Storytelling is storytelling. You still play by the same narrative rules. The technology is completely different. I don't use one piece of technology that I used when I started directing.": "James",
  "I believe 3D is inevitable because it's about aligning our entertainment systems to our sensory system. We all have two eyes we all see the world in 3D. And it's natural for us to want our entertainment in 3D as well. It's just getting the technology - it's really more the business model than the technology piece. We've solved the technology.

  "Making duplicate copies and computer printouts of things no one wanted even one of in the first place is giving America a new sense of purpose.": "Andy",
  "The divine wisdom which requires a division of labor has sown different abilities and tendencies in human nature and has enabled human beings to carry out the duty of establishing sciences and developing technology. The fulfillment of this duty is obligatory upon humanity as a whole, though not on every individual.": "Said",
  "I am extraordinarily fascinated by the future of technology. We are in the early infancy of technology, and we have an opportunity to guide how technology develops and integrates into our lives. I talk a lot about the 'invisible interface,' or the idea that we can utilize technology without being absorbed into a screen.": "Yves",
  "I don't particularly enjoy watching films in 3D because I think that a well-shot and well-projected film has a very three-dimensional quality to it, so I'm somewhat sceptical of the technology.": "Christopher",
  "For the last 10 years, I've felt increasing pressure to stop shooting film and start shooting video, but I've never understood why. It's cheaper to work on film, it's far better looking, it's the technology that's been known and understood for a hundred years, and it's extremely reliable.": "Christopher",
  "I am fascinated by all the new technology that creates places for us to meet in what is called cyberspace. I understand what it must have meant for the rebellions in the 19th century, especially in 1830 and 1848, when the mass circulated newspaper became so important for the spreading of information.": "Henning",
  "I am critical of modernity giving science and technology a blank check as if it were the fountain of all truth. That is not true. And I think I may have introduced a word which has now caught on quite a bit, scientism. Science is good. It simply reports a discovery.": "Huston",
  "These days the technology can solve our problems and then some. Solutions may not only erase physical or mental deficits but leave patients better off than 'able-bodied' folks. The person who has a disability today may have a superability tomorrow.": "Daniel",
  "Change creates fear, and technology creates change. Sadly, most people don't behave very well when they are afraid.": "Daniel",

  "I make short films, little documentaries, about the co-evolution of humans and technology.": "Jason",
  "My mode of presentation is short-form video - basically I create fast cut, impassioned 'idea explainers' that explode with enthusiasm and intensity as they distill how technology is expanding our sphere of possibility.": "Jason",

  "Absolutely everything undergoes evolvement - whether it's technology, journalism, the NFL, medicine.": "Marv",
  "It reflects a prevailing myth that production technology is no more amenable to human judgment or social interests than the laws of thermodynamics, atomic structure or biological inheritance.": "Barry",
  "One of the big things coming out of healthcare reform is a thing called the Community Living Assistance Services and Supports Act (CLASS) which is a mechanism to reimburse people staying at home for technology and services that allow them to stay at home.": "Colin",
  "The computer offers another kind of creativity. You cannot ignore the creativity that computer technology can bring. But you need to be able to move between those two different worlds.": "Tadao",
  "I don't mind if somebody texts me but I'm not a big texter, the things are too small. I don't mind if they text, '7 o'clock,' that's fine, that's logistics but, 'What's up?' Get real! Pick up a phone!": "Penny",

  "We will create a civilization of the Mind in Cyberspace. May it be more humane and fair than the world your governments have made before.": "John",
  "I'll take transformational change any way it comes. One way to look at meditation is as a kind of intrapsychic technology that's been developed over thousands of years by traditions that know a lot about the mind/body connection. To call what happens 'the placebo effect' is just to give a name to something we don't understand.": "Jon",
  "Technology has to be invented or adopted.": "Jared",
  "Technology is something you have to embrace because technology is part of our generation. Digital natives, for instance, are people who grew up in a world that always had the Internet and who always had smartphones. Millennials aren't too far behind: my generation of people, who were in the mix of the Internet when it first came out.": "Jon",
  "I think it's important for people to stay human and remember that genuine human connection is more fulfilling than anything that technology has to offer. We all have it within us, and music is something that can bring that out of us.": "Jon",
  "This really is a merger of equals. I wouldn't have come back to work for anything less than this fantastic opportunity. This lets me combine my two great loves - technology and biscuits.": "Louis",

  "I'd like to get back home to Nova Scotia more, but thankfully, with technology you can call and text and FaceTime. But physically being in Toronto or Nova Scotia... there's nothing like it.": "Diego",
  "There is no Constitutional right to prey on others. The Internet is just a piece of technology, like the telephone. Society has the right to modify its uses.": "Andrew",
  "Be skeptical of concepts that divorce war from its political nature, particularly those that promise fast, cheap victory through technology.": "H.",
  "I'm afraid I am a bit of a technophobe - a nineteenth-century man caught in the twenty-first century. But there is one piece of technology that I would especially welcome: a device to automatically balance restaurant tables on all four legs so that they don't rock back and forth.": "Leonard",
  "People are stunned to hear that one company has data files on 185 million Americans.": "Ralph",
  "What's sort of interesting about the whole public relations disaster that is the Net, in some ways, is that the fundamentals are really good.": "Meg",
  "I got to get the right people in the right job. Because a lot of costs can be taken out in the context of your administration without the legislature. For example, using technology to do more with less. Using technology to fight fraud. Reorganizing and streamlining can be done within the context of the administration.": "Meg",
  "You can have the best technology in the world, but if you don't have a community who wants to use it and who are excited about it, then it has no purpose.": "Chris",
  "Doing linear scans over an associative array is like trying to club someone to death with a loaded Uzi.": "Larry",
  "Real programmers can write assembly code in any language.": "Larry",
  "I want people to use Perl. I want to be a positive ingredient of the world and make my American history. So, whatever it takes to give away my software and get it used, that's great.": "Larry",
  "Technology has made music accessible in a philosophically interesting way, which is great. But on the other hand, when everybody has the ability to make magic, it's like there's no more magic - if the audience can just do it themselves, why are they going to bother?": "Thomas",
  "ChicagoNEXT is focused on making Chicago the best possible place for technology entrepreneurs.": "J.",
  "I understood the importance in principle of public key cryptography but it's all moved much faster than I expected. I did not expect it to be a mainstay of advanced communications technology.": "Whitfield",
  "Every time somebody tries to go in and reinvent what we do, it always ends up being more about technology and sets, and flash and dash, forgetting the main thing, which is interesting people saying interesting, important things.": "Diane",
  "Since Stonehenge, architects have always been at the cutting edge of technology. And you can't separate technology from the humanistic and spiritual content of a building.": "Norman",
  "What the country needs are a few labor-making inventions.": "Arnold",
  "Cognitive therapy is a fast-acting technology of mood modification that you can learn to apply on your own. It can help you eliminate the symptoms and experience personal growth so you can minimize future upsets and cope with depression more effectively in the future.": "David",
  "We are already producing enough food to feed the world. We already have technology in place that allows us to produce more than we can find a market for.": "Jeremy",
  "For a lot of people, one of the reasons they don't like to work for founders of startups is that they can be sensitive and protective around what they've built. You have an emotional attachment to the early marketing and technology materials, and you don't want to hear that anything's wrong with them.": "Lynn",
  "Advances in technology and in our understanding of illness and disease together with an expanded workforce and greater resources will allow us to provide more services to a higher quality.": "John",
  "Light-field photography is a transformational technology that needs a transformational product to introduce it. For the first time, we have a light-field camera that's going to be for everyone - not something in a huge room in a research facility.": "Ren",
  "With light field technology, there is a huge opportunity for creativity in photography that hasn't been available in the past.": "Ren",
  "I made physical objects because I know how to do something on the computer. That struck a chord with me: Most women of my generation have grown up with technology but lack the handmade creative skills of former generations. This is a big opportunity to fill that gap.": "Brit",
  "The great growling engine of change - technology.": "Alvin",
  "I forced myself to think what is the new concept and it became clear to me that it was risk, not only in technology and ecology, but in life and employment, too.": "Ulrich",
  "Because of technological limits, there is a certain amount of food that we can produce per acre. If we were to have intensive greenhouse agriculture, we could have much higher production.": "Ralph",
  "I've been looking at the iPod- the Apple iPod. One of the interesting things about the iPod, one of the things that people love most about it is not the technology; it's the box it comes in.": "Donald",
  "The DJ still has the relationship with the people, I believe. I don't know to call the DJ 'the ambassadors' or what, but we still are connecting the dots, getting the good stuff and passing it on to the people. DJs still have relevance, even with the technology that elevates the DJ beyond being a selector.": "Ali",

  "Congress will pass a law restricting public comment on the Internet to individuals who have spent a minimum of one hour actually accomplishing a specific task while on line.": "Andy",
  "I think it is inevitable that people program poorly. Training will not substantially help matters. We have to learn to live with it.": "Alan",
  "What constrains or enables the capacity of human beings to work in groups is not so much the technology, but rather the capacity of the human brain to have and monitor social interactions.": "Nicholas",
  "I see robotic technology getting rid of the dangerous, the dirty, and the just plain boring jobs. Some people say, 'You can't. People won't have anything to do.' But we found things that were a lot easier than backbreaking labor in the sun and the fields. Let people rise to better things.": "Rodney",
  "You go to a technology conference or an engineering conference, there are very few women there. At the same time it's a blessing in the fact that you do get noticed. People tend to remember you as the only woman in the room 'who said that', or the only woman in the room who was an engineer.": "Padmasree",
  "We could talk, act, and dress funny. We were excused for socially inappropriate behavior: 'Oh, he's a programmer'. It was all because we knew this technology stuff that other people found completely mystifying.": "Kent",
  "If someone is trying to skip the struggle - which is the creative job - our machines today, the technology that we have, can help the person, but it is only momentary. On the other hand, if you are creative, you have the skill, and you are hardworking, technology can only make you superior.": "Arijit",
  "The internet is a great way to get on the net.": "Bob",
  "While there have been terrific advances in the state of technology around heuristics, behavior blocking, and things like that, technology is only a part of the approach to solving the problem with the more important aspect involving putting the right process in place.": "John",
  "One of the things that has been truly incredible to observe though, is the amount of venture investment that has gone into early stage security technology.": "John",
  "When are boots in the ground no longer going to have to even be people, and is that right? When does it become 'Star Wars?' When is enough enough? When do we put this time and energy into eliminating war or reasons for war instead of creating new technology to make war easier for us?": "Michael",

  "It's not that we use technology, we live technology.": "Godfrey",

  "I'm an optimist about the power of technology to transform lives for the better.": "Julius",
  "If cheap immigrant labor is made unavailable, employers can hire Americans at a higher wage, or replace low-wage immigrant workers with technology and automation, which will create a smaller number of skilled jobs for Americans.": "Jan",
  "There are no morals about technology at all. Technology expands our ways of thinking about things, expands our ways of doing things. If we're bad people we use technology for bad purposes and if we're good people we use it for good purposes.": "Herbert",

  "The Strauss Group identified water as a strategic category presenting significant business opportunity in line with the Group's long term business strategy and vision. We view the development of a technology that enables high quality drinking water for both home and offices as a means to improve the quality of life of millions of people.": "Ofra",
  "Biology, it's the technology which builds our world, and we can harness it to shift humanity from a scarcity to an abundance economy.": "Ryan",
  "Building technical systems involves a lot of hard work and specialized knowledge: languages and protocols, coding and debugging, testing and refactoring.": "Jesse",
  "When dealing in the technology, it becomes a question of whether you overuse something. I think that's worse than having something technologically available to you and not using it.": "Al",
  "For much of this decade, both Congressional and administration budget projections showed a decline in science and technology accounts of between 20 and 30 percent in real dollars. The real impact to date has been far less severe.": "Charles",

  "We are finally entering an exciting time in medicine where we have the technology to custom-tailor treatment and preventive protocols just as we'd custom-tailor a suit or designer gown to one's individual body.

  "If you're not looking toward the future or trying to improve the current technology, you'll be left behind.": "Gwynne",
  "People thought I was very pro-computer. I was on the cover of 'Wired' magazine. Then things began to change. In the early '80s, we met this technology and became smitten like young lovers. But today our attachment is unhealthy.": "Sherry",
  "I have an almost religious zeal... not for technology per se, but for the Internet which is for me, the nervous system of mother Earth, which I see as a living creature, linking up.": "Dan",

  "To bring out a new technology for consumers first, you just had a very long road to go down to try to find people who actually would pay money for something.": "Marc",
  "If you want to be a modern citizen of the world, you have to be minimally capable in technology. It's a new literacy test. Technology rules your outcome in life. And software is making a lot of decisions in our lives.": "Daniel",
  "Technology is similarly just a catalyst at times for fundamental forces already present.": "Scott",
  "I think that's the phenomenon of our time is that a lot of women keep themselves in good shape but that there's not a lot of accommodation or people out there to connect with and the technology.": "Stockard",
  "If we're building high quality companies, if the customers like the products, if the technology innovation is real, then the substance is going to win out in the end.": "Marc",
  "There's evidence of a social decline in direct proportion to technology and the industrialization of the motion picture industry.": "Mark",

  "Piecemeal social engineering resembles physical engineering in regarding the ends as beyond the province of technology.": "Karl",
  "This is magic we're talking about. It's supposed to go places science can't, defy logic, wink at technology, fill us all with the sensawunda that comes of gazing upon a fictional world and seeing something truly different from our own.": "N.",

  "The great paradox of the 21st century is that, in this age of powerful technology, the biggest problems we face internationally are problems of the human soul.": "Ralph",

  "I worked in information technology and academia for a long time and met many people who were better with things and ideas than with people.": "Graeme",
  "I'm no online whiz, but I'm not a Luddite, either. I love that we have these laptops and tablets and smart phones; they're awesome and convenient and all that. It's more about maintaining balance. Technology should always be a predicate of the true subject: our individual humanity, our examined lives.": "Paul",
  "I grew up in the Silicon Valley when it was a bunch of apricot groves, and now it's this center of incredible activity. So I have this sense of what technology has done for this region, and I want to spread it to the world.": "Timothy",

  "Most people who are on the inside of a technology have no idea what it's like to look at from an end user's point of view. This is why they have focus groups. I'm really familiar with this because I worked 10 years for Hallmark Cards in the U.S.": "Pat",

  "My job as artistic director at the Brighton digital agency Lighthouse is all about trying to show that digital culture is about more than just tools and gadgets - it's about perceiving the societal transformations being brought about by technology.": "Honor",
  "I was really fascinated by some of the things happening with Anonymous, the hackers group.

  "Technology makes the world a new place.": "Shoshana",
  "People would like better batteries but they are wary of making investments. What is required is both a technology push and a market pull.": "Donald",

  "Just the idea to have everything you need essentially stored in one piece of portable technology is very exciting.": "Graham",
  "Society has changed so dramatically that it's empowered the individual, and technology has a lot to do with that. Years ago, if you had a bad experience at a restaurant, you could complain to the manager. Maybe you could picket. Now, you go online and write a review that may go viral.": "Brad",
