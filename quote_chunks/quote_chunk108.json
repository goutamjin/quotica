  "My mother was a great inspiration to me to always do my best. My father has always been my mentor and friend. They taught me the basic principle that guides most all that I do: faith, focus, finish.": "Larry",
  "I think that 'Little Angels' provides the gateway into that conversation about faith and about the Lord and about God's love for us. Remembering that the angels are just the messengers and the message is the message of love.": "Roma",
  "Some people think that there aren't many Aboriginal actors around, and if there are, they're not that good. It's stupid. There's such an incredible pool of talent out there, and they're still coming out of drama schools. People just need to take a leap of faith.": "Deborah",
  "Faith in technocrats over politicians is not a trend from which Britain is exempt.": "David",
  "For most of us, the great danger is not that we will renounce our faith. It is that we will become so distracted and rushed and preoccupied that we will settle for a mediocre version of it. We will just skim our lives instead of actually living them.": "John",
  "Compared to developed countries, or even to some major emerging countries, burdened by aging populations, financial crises, widening budget deficits, faltering faith in politics and growing social demands, Africa has become the world's last 'New Frontier:' a kind of 'it-continent.'": "Mo",
  "I'm a Christian, and I believe that God has a plan and a purpose for each one of our lives and that He can intercede in all kinds of situations, and we need to have a little faith in many things.": "Sharron",
  "My tunnel vision work ethic is very hard to come by, I believe. I have had an unwavering faith in myself and my career for as long as I can remember.": "Tinashe",
  "My feminism is what came squarely up against my faith. There's a lot of ecstatic post-patriarchal Christians who have stuff they do with that. But at that point, you're doing Christianity with a double-superscript. The Bible, and especially the book of Genesis, is pretty unapologetically patriarchal.": "John",
  "I am a person of faith who believes deeply in the right to exercise religious beliefs.": "Dannel",
  "Faith is the complete reliance on the power and goodness of Spirit and the firm belief that you are always connected to this goodness. Always affirm your faith and not your doubt.": "Wayne",
  "If you believe in prayer at all, expect God to hear you. If you do not expect, you will not have. God will not hear you unless you believe He will hear you; but if you believe He will, He will be as good as your faith.": "Charles",
  "In prayer, we stand where angels bow with veiled faces. There, even there, the cherubim and seraphim adore before that selfsame throne to which our prayers ascend. And shall we come there with stunted requests and narrow, contracted faith?": "Charles",
  "If you would attract good fortune, you must get rid of doubt. As long as that stands between you and your ambition, it will be a bar that will cut you off. You must have faith. No man can make a fortune while he is convinced that he can't.": "Orison",
  "There are those who say we must rescind the Golan Heights law that was passed in the Knesset. To rescind is a concept from the days of the Inquisition. Our forefathers were burned at the stake and would not rescind their faith.": "Menachem",
  "Pope Benedict XVI's resignation is big on buzz but is not the stunning surprise claimed by many pundits. It is rather a further example of the German theology professor's style that informed his years as head of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, his term as pope, and the formation of his legacy to the church.": "Eugene",
  "The Golden Temple, Sikhism's holiest shrine, is in northwestern India near the Pakistani border, and it is a delightful place to contemplate the draw of faith.": "Nicholas",
  "Satan, our adversary, wants us to fail. He spreads lies as part of his effort to destroy our belief. He slyly suggests that the doubter, the skeptic, the cynic is sophisticated and intelligent, while those who have faith in God and His miracles are naive, blind, or brainwashed.": "Dieter",
  "Faith is as essential to the spiritual realm as oxygen is to the natural realm.": "Ray",
  "Fidelity and allegiance sworn to the King is only such a fidelity and obedience as is due to him by the law of the land; for were that faith and allegiance more than what the law requires, we would swear ourselves slaves and the King absolute; whereas, by the law, we are free men, notwithstanding those oaths.": "Isaac",
  "If you simply put your faith in Jesus coming down in flesh, through a human being, God becoming flesh living on the earth, dying on the cross for the sins of the world, being buried, and being raised from the dead - yours and mine and everybody else's problems will be solved.": "Phil",
  "Erosion of faith and trust in government - that is the real problem that confronts us.": "Rodrigo",
  "The values of democracy, brotherhood, and freedom that constitute the building blocks of American society are also shared by Israeli society, together with the faith in man's power and ability to change and influence his surroundings.": "Ehud",
  "I had a lot of trouble in school to begin with. I got left back in kindergarten, and I was in special education. My teachers didn't have very much faith in me.": "Jesse",
  "The death of compromise has become a threat to our nation as we confront crucial issues such as the debt ceiling and that most basic of legislative responsibilities: a federal budget. At stake is the very meaning of what had once seemed unshakable: 'the full faith and credit' of the U.S. government.": "Deborah",
  "Is it not hard that even those who are with us should be against us - that a man's enemies, in some degree, should be those of the same household of faith? Yet so it is.": "John",
  "God guides his church, maintains her always, and especially in difficult times. Let us never lose this vision of faith, which is the only true vision of the way of the church and the world.": "Pope",
  "Religious faith, like political belief, should be based on reasoning, on the development of thought and feelings. The two things are inseparable.": "Fidel",
  "'Grace' is basically a death prayer. Not something of sorrow, but of just casting away any fear of death. No relief will come - you really just have to stew in your life until it's time to go. But sometimes, somebody else's faith in you can do wonders.": "Jeff",
  "We have to reappropriate the concept of laicite (secularism) so we can explain to our young pupils that whatever their faith, they belong to this idea, and they're not excluded. Secularism is not something against them; it protects them.": "Najat",
  "Base souls have no faith in great individuals.": "Jean-Jacques",
  "I want our government to encourage and protect freedom as well as our traditions of faith and family.": "Jesse",
  "Faith is the state of being ultimately concerned.": "Paul",

  "Losing faith in your own singularity is the start of wisdom, I suppose; also the first announcement of death.": "Peter",
  "Faith never makes a confession.": "Henry",
  "In the Christian faith, God really puts suffering front and center. He doesn't get squeamish about it.": "Joni",
  "The great moral powers of the soul are faith, hope, and love.": "Ellen",
  "God revealed himself through the Law, which pointed to Christ as its end and goal, commanded the obedience that comes from faith, increased transgressions, and shut the mouths of all humans because no one has performed the righteousness of the Law so as not to need a substitute.": "John",
  "There will always be those little minds who, out of vanity or intellectual display, will attempt to destroy faith in the very foundations of life.": "Ezra",
  "Faith, there hath been many great men that have flattered the people who ne'er loved them.": "William",

  "Our faith comes in moments our vice is habitual. ": "Ralph",
  "The faith that stands on authority is not faith.": "Ralph",
  "I believe in my Mormon faith, and I endeavor to live by it. My faith is the faith of my fathers - I will be true to them and to my beliefs.": "Mitt",
  "When doubt comes against us, we have to lift up the shield of faith. We do this when we open our mouth and say what God's Word says, rather than grumbling and complaining about the problem.": "Joyce",
  "I've learned through my own relationship with God that He's not expecting me to be perfect; He wants me to do my best to be in His will and take steps of faith as He leads me, through His Word and the promptings He speaks to my heart.": "Joyce",
  "The left puts a lot of faith in a lot of people in the past that were dismal failures that they think are the greatest people who ever lived.": "Rush",

  "Faith is easy I think people complicate it. ": "Joel",
  "I can't prove it scientifically, that there's a God, but I believe.": "Billy",
  "Each party steals so many articles of faith from the other, and the candidates spend so much time making each other's speeches, that by the time election day is past there is nothing much to do save turn the sitting rascals out and let a new gang in.": "H.",

  "In the Church, and in the journey of faith, women have had and still have a special role in opening doors to the Lord.": "Pope",
  "Sin, also for those who don't have faith, exists when one goes against one's conscience. To listen to and obey it means, in fact, to decide in face of what is perceived as good or evil. And on this decision pivots the goodness or malice of our action.": "Pope",
  "Duty cannot exist without faith.": "Benjamin",
  "Call-time has renewed my faith in the need for public financing of elections. 'Call-time' is where I as the candidate, sit in a room with my 'call-time manager,' and a phone. Then I call people and ask them for money. For hours. Apparently, I'm really good at it.": "Al",
  "When I was young, I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters: a family, a business and a good name. I was raised to believe in hard work, in faith and family. My dad, Ed Pence, was a combat veteran in Korea.": "Mike",
  "Faith embraces many truths which seem to contradict each other.": "Blaise",
  "Faith indeed tells what the senses do not tell, but not the contrary of what they see. It is above them and not contrary to them.": "Blaise",
  "I just sort of take it from a character perspective, and I don't know if he was necessarily spiritual, but I do think he had hope. He was a character that was comfortable having hope in his life, and hope is faith.": "Ryan",
  "Being afraid to tell the truth because of the projected consequences, whatever it may be, shows a lack of faith and an abundance of fear.": "Monica",
  "We must not sit still and look for miracles; up and doing, and the Lord will be with thee. Prayer and pains, through faith in Christ Jesus, will do anything.": "George",
  "Under Pope Francis, we have seen a change at the Vatican that is reflective of the church I know and love. He approaches controversial doctrine or past wrongdoing with humility, understanding, and faith in the goodness of mankind. He has served as a voice for the voiceless and has been working to re-establish the church as a home for the homeless.": "Donna",
  "Faith crosses every border and touches every heart in every nation.": "George",
  "Criticism in good faith is good. When it's targeted solely to destruction, I'm not interested.": "Andrea",
  "Faith is part of who I am, yes. I was raised Christian Scientist. The most important thing I saw every single week on the wall at Sunday school was the Golden Rule.": "Ellen",
  "On the one hand, faith is a profoundly personal contact with God, which touches me in my innermost being and places me in front of the living God in absolute immediacy in such a way that I can speak with Him, love Him, and enter into communion with Him.": "Pope",
  "Both need each other: The agnostic cannot be content to not know, but must be in search of the great truth of faith; the Catholic cannot be content to have faith, but must be in search of God all the time, and in the dialogue with others, a Catholic can learn more about God in a deeper fashion.": "Pope",
  "And that's the great thing about living the Christian life and trying to live by faith, is you're trying to get better every day. You're trying to improve.": "Tim",
  "It's attractive when girls have faith. That is a big thing for me.": "Tim",
  "The first holy truth in God 101 is that men and women of true faith have always had to accept the mystery of God's identity and love and ways. I hate that, but it's the truth.": "Anne",
  "For modes of faith let graceless zealots fight, His can't be wrong whose life is in the right.": "Alexander",
  "I think there ought to be a strict separation or wall built between our religious faith and our practice of political authority in office. I don't think the President of the United States should extoll Christianity if he happens to be a Christian at the expense of Judaism, Islam or other faiths.": "Jimmy",
  "Evolution and creationism both require faith. It's just a matter of where you choose to place that faith.": "Ben",
  "Faith means belief in something concerning which doubt is theoretically possible.": "William",
  "It is only by risking our persons from one hour to another that we live at all. And often enough our faith beforehand in an uncertified result is the only thing that makes the result come true.": "William",
  "Confound not faith and feeling together. They are distinct. Faith is ours to exercise. Believe, believe. Let your faith take hold of the blessing, and it is yours by faith. Your feelings have nothing to do with this faith.": "Ellen",
  "This is the kingdom of God on the earth. Because of that, it has a power beyond any other endeavor in which humans can engage. That power depends on the faith of those called to serve in it.": "Henry",
  "You must have faith to pray. You must have faith to ponder the word of God. You must have faith to do those things and go to those places which invite the Spirit of Christ and the Holy Ghost.": "Henry",
  "We were promised that we would have Jehovah, Jesus Christ, as our Savior and Redeemer. He would assure that we would all be resurrected. And He would make it possible for us to pass the test of life if we exercised faith in Him by being obedient.": "Henry",
  "Our society is illuminated by the spiritual insights of the Hebrew prophets. America and Israel have a common love of human freedom, and they have a common faith in a democratic way of life.": "Lyndon",
  "Hold firmly that our faith is identical with that of the ancients. Deny this, and you dissolve the unity of the Church.": "Thomas",
  "Real faith is when you believe in something that you can't see. When things are going really bad and you can still get up and say I believe that they're gonna get better, that there's a higher lesson to what I'm going through. It can be hard sometimes, and to turn it around like that, that's true faith.": "Keke",
  "Many Muslims put their Islamic faith ahead of their national identity and forbid preachers from other religions from coming into their countries to convert their young. Apostasy is treason to Allah. Heresy has no rights.": "Pat",
  "I was born into a Christian family and brought up in a Lutheran church. My faith has been the center point of my life, really, since I was a child, but at 16 years of age, I fully surrendered my life over to Christ. At that point, as a teenager, I began to grasp the concept of Christ's true love and forgiveness.": "Michele",
  "If you have faith in the public sector, as I do, you must be the harshest critic of corruption, waste and fraud in government.": "Eric",
  "The best way is to say that as a Christian for me the essence of Christian faith is that you treat others as if you wish to be treated.": "Mike",
  "All of my children are ideologically and politically in sync with me, they all have authentic Christian faith. It's something I'm very grateful for.": "Mike",
  "It seems to me that we often commit ourselves wholly to something while knowing almost nothing concrete about it. Another word for that, I suppose, is 'faith.'": "Zadie",
  "I'm a born-again Christian. I was raised Episcopalian - I've always been of a Christian faith, but I became much more active in it when I married my first husband, Marvin. I changed from Episcopalian to Baptist.": "Natalie",
  "For me, the peculiar qualities of faith are a logical outcome of this level of biological organization.": "E.",
  "Since coming back from overseas, this is more of a foreign country than the places overseas. I don't understand it. It's like America has lost faith in rational thought.": "James",
  "There is far more misunderstanding of Islam than there is, I think, of the other religions of the world. So many things are said of it by those who do not belong to that faith.": "Annie",
  "My gut feeling about sequels is that they should be premeditated: You should try to write a trilogy first or at least sketch out a trilogy if you have any faith in your film.": "Vin",
  "The faith religious believers have in God is small compared to the faith people put in politicians, knowing how many times they have been disappointed in the past but still insisting that this time it will be different.": "Jonathan",
  "If faith is your motivation, share that.": "Tim",
  "In a world of prayer, we are all equal in the sense that each of us is a unique person, with a unique perspective on the world, a member of a class of one.": "W.",
  "Faith, to my mind, is a stiffening process, a sort of mental starch.": "E.",
  "I have faith in the United States and our ability to make good decisions based on the facts.": "Al",
  "Prayer is a privilege and the soul's sincere desire. We can move beyond routine and 'checklist' prayers and engage in meaningful prayer as we appropriately ask in faith and act, as we patiently persevere through the trial of our faith, and as we humbly acknowledge and accept 'not my will, but Thine, be done.'": "David",
  "We can't solve modern problems by going back in time. Retreating to the safety of the familiar is an understandable response, but God has called us to a life of faith. And faith requires us to face the unknown while trusting Him completely.": "Charles",
  "I always wanted to be honest with myself and to those who have had faith in me.": "Rafael",
  "I committed my life to Christ, and that faith has been most important to me ever since.": "Peyton",
  "For me, my family and my faith have been what's really been my anchor, and grounding me, and helping me navigate through a lot of the things that really destroy marriages in Hollywood, and in your own personal integrity.": "Kirk",
  "The more frightening and sort of dark and oppressive a movie is, the more free you are to explore the supernatural and explore faith. The two just somehow go hand-in-hand really nicely.": "Scott",
  "Family and friends and faith are the most important things in your life and you should be building friendships.": "Barbara",
  "I believe that if we really want human brotherhood to spread and increase until it makes life safe and sane, we must also be certain that there is no one true faith or path by which it may spread.": "Adlai",
  "I first heard of General Anders and his army more than 50 years ago. I admired him then, and I admire him still; and I feel a special bond with the men, women and children whom he rescued from hunger, disease, and official abuse. Theirs is a story of endurance and fortitude that gives one faith in the human spirit.": "Norman",
  "Nothing guarantees that reasonable people will agree about everything, of course, but the unreasonable are certain to be divided by their dogmas. It is time we recognized that this spirit of mutual inquiry, which is the foundation of all real science, is the very antithesis of religious faith.": "Sam",
  "When I believe in Jesus, I am united to Christ. Therefore, what he did and achieved becomes mine by this union through faith alone. His righteous life is imputed to me. What Christ achieved is counted as mine.": "John",
  "Art requires neither complaisance nor politeness; nothing but faith, faith and freedom.": "Gustave",
  "From LeBron's standpoint, if a guy like Kyrie walks away - that creates doubt. But Kyrie committed right away, and that's a major statement about his faith in us.": "Dan",
  "There has to be a measure of faith. That's what this business is all about: trusting in something that may never show up, that you have no concrete proof of.": "Wentworth",
  "The only faith that wears well and holds its color in all weathers is that which is woven of conviction and set with the sharp mordant of experience.": "James",
  "I have never known Frances to complain once of my Church responsibilities. I have been gone many days and many nights, and I have rarely been able to sit with her in the congregation. But there is no one like her - absolutely no one. She is in every way supportive and is a woman of quiet and profoundly powerful faith.": "Thomas",
  "It's a leap of faith doing any serialised storytelling.": "J.",
  "Every life is a profession of faith, and exercises an inevitable and silent influence.": "Henri",
  "Young people, some of whom are not born into the faith, are being fired up by preachers using basic Islamic scripture and mobilized to wage jihad by radical imams who represent themselves as legitimate Muslim clergymen.": "Ayaan",
  "Ann Romney makes all women proud by the way she has conducted her life as a strong woman of faith, as a mother, as a wife and as a true patriot.": "Nikki",
  "Among the many signs of a lively faith and hope we have in eternal life, one of the surest is not being overly sad at the death of those whom we dearly love in our Lord.": "Saint",
  "You were made by God and for God, and until you understand that, life will never make sense.": "Rick",
  "Most people don't realize, I really have no faith in politics. I'm not a politician. If I thought you could change human hearts by laws, I would, but I don't.": "Rick",
  "The future of Conservatism lies in our beliefs and values, not by throwing them away. We need to shed associations that bind us to past failures, but hold faith with those things that make us Conservatives.": "Iain",
  "Art used to be made in the name of faith. We made cathedrals, we made stained-glass windows, we made murals.": "Julia",
  "Moving out to L.A. for me was a leap of faith. I was very secure in my dinner theater world; I loved it, and I was just like, 'I think there's something else out there for me and I just have to go for it.'": "Amy",
  "You can't ignore the reality that faith and family, those two things are integral parts of having limited government, lower taxes, and free societies.": "Rick",
  "God continues to work miracles in my life.": "Willie",
  "Fasting is, first and foremost, an exercise for identifying and managing adversity in all its forms. With faith, in full conscience, fasting calls women and men to an extra degree of self-awareness.": "Tariq",
  "Christ commands those who believe to be baptized. Pedobaptists adopt a system which tends to preclude the baptism of believers. They baptize the involuntary infant and deprive him of the privilege of ever professing his faith in the appointed way. If this system were universally adopted, it would banish believers' baptism out of the world.": "Adoniram",
  "Christianity has always embraced both reason and faith.": "Dinesh",
  "Nobody gets argued all the way into becoming a believer on the sheer basis of logic and reason. That requires a leap of faith.": "Francis",
  "Risk means everything from being honest about your faith, to moving, to quitting a job that's paying you a fortune but it's not what's in your heart. Risking things is one of the biggest fears we have.": "John",
  "My primary assessment would be because American Christians tend to be incredibly self-indulgent, so they see the church as a place there for them to meet their needs and to express faith in a way that is meaningful for them.": "Erwin",
  "Every living soul among the Latter-day Saints that fasts two meals once a month will be benefited spiritually and be built up in the faith of the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ - benefited spiritually in a wonderful way - and sufficient means will be in the hands of the bishops to take care of all the poor.": "Heber",
  "Today we often think that before we start living a religious life we have first to accept the creedal doctrines and that before one can have any comprehension of the loyalty and trust of faith, one must first force one's mind to accept a host of incomprehensible doctrines. But this is to put the cart before the horse.": "Karen",
  "Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history therefore we must be saved by faith. ": "Reinhold",
  "In a mood of faith and hope my work goes on. A ream of fresh paper lies on my desk waiting for the next book. I am a writer and I take up my pen to write.": "Pearl",
  "The greatest act of faith is when a man understands he is not God.": "Oliver",
  "Christianity is not rationalism, but faith in God's revelation. A conspicuous, all-important item in that revelation is the resurrection of the body.": "Edward",
  "Above all, cancer is a spiritual practice that teaches me about faith and resilience.": "Kris",
  "I think there is a great deal of interest still in the Christian faith.": "Rowan",
  "I've never bought this idea of taking a therapeutic distance. If I see a student or house staff cry, I take great faith in that. That's a great person; they're going to be a great doctor.": "Abraham",
  "Human misery is too great for men to do without faith.": "Heinrich",
  "What does God the Father look like? Although I've never seen Him, I believe - as with the Holy Spirit - He looks like Jesus looked on earth.": "Benny",
  "I have always marveled that so many religions exact such revenge against dissenters. It only weakens the appeal of their faith and contradicts any claims they might have made that 'all religions are basically the same.'": "Ravi",
  "One misconception is that if we follow God in the life of faith, and that means obedience - that we read His Word, we're obedient, we pray, we go to church, we do the right things - that somehow His blessing means we're going to be okay.": "Anne",
  "I have come to the conclusion that the most important element in human life is faith.": "Rose",
  "For my future I have no concern, and as a true philosopher, I never would have any, for I know not what it may be: as a Christian, on the other hand, faith must believe without discussion, and the stronger it is, the more it keeps silent.": "Giacomo",
  "Faith is the confidence, the assurance, the enforcing truth, the knowing.": "Robert",
  "Such a faith would be fatal to my reason, to my liberty, and even to the success of my undertakings; it would immediately transform me into a stupid slave, an instrument of the will and interests of others.": "Mikhail",
  "My reason nourishes my faith and my faith my reason.": "Norman",
  "My own faith was nurtured by my grandmother and her clinging deeply to her faith when she was dying a painful and slow death from cancer.": "Geoffrey",
  "I believe that for lots of churches and religious institutions, their main focus on the development of faith among parishioners needs to spread to the community.": "Geoffrey",
  "Wherever God has given faith, it is given, among other reasons, for the very purpose of being tried.": "George",
  "The more I am in a position to be tried in faith with reference to my body, my family, my service for the Lord, my business, etc., the more shall I have opportunity of seeing God's help and deliverance; and every fresh instance, in which He helps and delivers me, will tend towards the increase of my faith.": "George",
  "Be assured that Christianity is something more than forms and creeds and ceremonies: there is life, and power, and reality, in our holy faith.": "George",
  "Faith is in the eye of the beholder.": "Tilda",
  "I'm a private guy, and you don't want to be out there preaching to people. But faith leads you in the decisions you make. You don't always pick the right path, but it's there in your conscience.": "Tim",
  "Faith is not uprooted by dialectic proof it must already be deeply shaken by other causes to be unable to withstand the shock of argument. ": "Emile",
  "Faith is not a political strategy and should not be a political strategy. If it is being used as a tool to garner votes, to convince people they should support one political party or the other, I think that is a huge mistake.": "John",
  "There are times in my 30 years in the theater that I have come perilously close to losing faith in the one form of action I have in this life.": "Athol",

  "In Christ the original image of God is restored, by faith in this world and by sight in the world to come.": "Walter",
  "Oklahomans value our children and our seniors. Oklahomans value traditions of faith. Oklahomans value our heroes, our veterans. Oklahomans value innovation and the creative arts.": "Brad",
  "Theatre's great. It's such an act of faith. It's a wonderful art form where you suspend disbelief for a couple of hours. It's a lovely art form because the actors and the audience are alive and in the room at the same time together. That's why I love the theatre.": "Israel",
  "A faith is something you die for, a doctrine is something you kill for. There is all the difference in the world.": "Tony",
  "I came from a tradition where souls were a theological reality, not a faith reality. Souls were for saving, not for communing. Souls were for converting and, once they were converted, they were to be left alone. Souls were too mystical, too subjective, too ambiguous, too risky, too... well, you know - New Age-ish.": "Mike",
  "I suppose I should say that I treasure blasphemy, as a faith of the highest order.": "Rick",
  "Your belief system tends to be a function of how you were raised. Being raised in the Midwest and in a relatively conservative household, my views were shaped by my upbringing, by my Christian faith.": "Aaron",
  "I would not attack the faith of a heathen without being sure I had a better one to put in its place.": "Harriet",
  "Let it ever be remembered that genuine faith in Christ will ever be productive of good works; for this faith worketh by love, as the apostle says, and love to God always produces obedience to his holy laws.": "Adam",
  "I'm very keen on having true freedom of expression. True freedom of faith. And free practice of religious faith.": "Mohammed",
  "That bedrock faith that I could write was what blinded me to attempts to discourage me.": "Lynn",
  "And as the Divine that goes forth from the Lord is the good of love and the truth of faith, the angels are angels and are heaven in the measure in which they receive good and truth from the Lord.": "Emanuel",
  "Therefore, the church is not absolutely necessary as an object of faith, not even for us today, for then Abraham and the other prophets would not have given assent to those things which were revealed to them from God without any intervening help of the church.": "William",
  "Flatter not thyself in thy faith in God if thou hast not charity for thy neighbor.": "Francis",
  "For Christian faith not to be idle in the world, the work of doctors and garbage collectors, business executives and artists, stay-at-home moms or dads and scientists needs to be inserted into God's story with the world. That story needs to provide the most basic rules by which the game in all these spheres is played.": "Miroslav",
  "For Christians, faith is a precious good, the most valuable personal and social resource. When it is left untapped, the common good suffers - not just the particular interests of Christians.": "Miroslav",
  "The man who radiates good cheer, who makes life happier wherever he meets it, is always a man of vision and faith.": "Ella",
  "My faith is so strong that I believe that God made me 5-11 for a reason. For all the kids that have been told, no, that they can't do it, or all the kids that will be told no.": "Russell",
  "If there are Muslims who believe that they've got to kill Christians to make a way for the Islamic faith in the West, not only would they be disappointed, but it will lead to conflict, there's no doubt about that.": "George",
  "I think faith is vitally important to your day, your seconds in each day. Faith helps to get you through the day.": "Roland",
  "Although I'm a very emotional man, I just can't have blind faith; I have to find out for myself.": "David",
  "The power of faith will often shine forth the most when the character is naturally weak.": "Augustus",
  "Most of the things that really matter require faith. 'How do I know that my wife loves me?' 'How do I know that Mozart's 'Jupiter Symphony' is sublime and beautiful?' There are all sorts of things which come at a more lowly level than that - 'How do I know that two plus two equals four?' There are different layers, different types of knowing.": "N.",
  "Within orthodoxy, there is always a danger of faith collapsing into fear.": "N.",
  "We're very open and outspoken about our faith and our beliefs. We also talk about our doubts, our moments of insecurities. We talk about it all day, how we're inspired by God. We recognize little miracles every day, and that's how we're raising our daughter.": "Boris",
  "Godliness, as well as the doctrine of our faith, is a mystery.": "William",
  "The paradox of faith is that when we conform our lives to Christ then we gain our true freedom. And its fruit is profound and lasting happiness.": "Vincent",
  "I would never have gone anywhere if it hadn't been for Mother's faith and support.": "Patsy",
  "There's a lot of kids who look up to me, and that's humbling. Because being human, I don't want to fail them. But being human, I will. That's why it's so important to have your faith put in something that won't fail you. And that means the Son of God's kingdom.": "Si",
  "To restore the American experiment in democratic self-government, religious believers need to redouble their civic efforts. For without our active participation in politics, the government will continue to trample on our rights. The Constitution does not prevent people of faith from being active in politics.": "Edwin",
  "Skepticism has never founded empires, established principals, or changed the world's heart. The great doers in history have always been people of faith.": "Edwin",
  "Faith is the black person's federal reserve system.": "Hattie",
  "My family are observant Muslims, but I've come to the faith through an intellectual conviction, and that's something that they've taught me. It's never been forced upon me. They've given me a very strong identity as an Australian Muslim.": "Randa",
  "You have got to believe in yourself every time you go out there and race. If you have no faith in your ability all that training has been a waste of time.": "Maurice",
  "I would say one must just keep working hard and not lose faith. You don't know when destiny is going to come your way, what opportunity comes your way.": "Sunny",
  "I hold that religion and faith are two different things.": "Pat",
  "I've never made football my priority. My priorities are my faith and my dependence on God.": "Bobby",
  "After the desperate years of their own war, after six years of repression inside Spain and six years of horror in exile, these people remain intact in spirit. They are armed with a transcendent faith; they have never won, and yet they have never accepted defeat.": "Martha",
  "It was seldom that I attended any religious meetings, as my parents had not much faith in and were never so unfortunate as to unite themselves with any of the religious sects.": "Orson",

  "Our Heavenly Father is pleased when we don't compromise our faith and principles in times of desperation.": "David",
  "The media seems to think only abortion and gay marriage are religious issues. Poverty is a moral issue, it's a faith issue, it's a religious issue.": "Jim",
  "I met the president when he was president-elect at a meeting in Austin. He spoke of his faith. He spoke of his desire for a compassionate conservatism, for a faith-based initiative that would do something for poor people.": "Jim",
  "Faith is never identical with piety.": "Karl",
  "When prayer removes distrust and doubt and enters the field of mental certainty, it becomes faith; and the universe is built on faith.": "Ernest",
  "To be a racing driver it's essential you have very good eyesight, and that's especially relevant at night. Your senses are heightened, you're travelling over 200mph, you need to focus on that 110-metre braking point and you have to have absolute faith and commitment in your driving.": "Allan",
  "God may not guide us in an obvious way because he wants us to make decisions based on faith and character.": "Dallas",
  "Christians can have doubts and they can have questions, and the unhealthy way to deal with that is to keep them inside where they fester and grow and can undermine our faith. The healthy way to deal with it is to talk about it and be honest about it.": "Lee",
  "I can't really put it in one sentence because although on one hand Preacher is about faith and yes it is also about, I suppose, the search for God, the search for faith and the manipulation and the abuse committed by figures in whom I suppose people have faith.": "Garth",
  "The issue of equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender individuals has vexed politicians for decades. I have my own cloudy history with the issue, having supported a law in Mississippi that made it illegal for LGBT couples to adopt children. I believed at the time this was a principled position based on my faith.": "Ronnie",
  "My heart hath often been deeply afflicted under a feeling that the standard of pure righteousness is not lifted up to the people by us, as a society, in that clearness which it might have been, had we been as faithful as we ought to be to the teachings of Christ.": "John",
  "To a certain extent I am taking a leap of faith. I'm adding up the evidence on either side, and I'm seeing the evidence of there not being a God is overwhelming compared to the evidence for there being a God.": "Julia",
  "God does say He will graciously entertain our prayers. He says that if we exercise faith, and if our request is in accordance with His will, He will hear us.": "Walter",
  "The substance of faith is a hope in the unseen.": "Ron",
  "Faith is not a thing which one 'loses', we merely cease to shape our lives by it.": "Georges",

  "There are divers men who make a great show of loyalty, and pretend to such discretion in the hidden things they hear, that at the end folk come to put faith in them.": "Marie",
  "'Revelations' is one of the most important pieces to the African American arts. It assesses the hope and despair of a people and overcoming the struggle with our faith.": "Robert",
  "I ask you, people who care about the soul of Ukraine, those who want to preserve the heart, the spirit and the faith of our country for future generations, to please defend it.": "Yulia",

  "The only thing an artist has to remember is to never lose faith in his vision.": "James",
  "You can be a virtuous person without faith in God.": "Bill",
  "Man is wise and constantly in quest of more wisdom; but the ultimate wisdom, which deals with beginnings, remains locked in a seed. There it lies, the simplest fact of the universe and at the same time the one which calls forth faith rather than reason.": "Hal",
  "Comedy is an escape, not from truth but from despair; a narrow escape into faith.": "Christopher",
  "I start work by spending time in personal Bible study. Because my projects center on a question in my own faith walk, I find Bible study essential. And God gives me scriptures daily that speak to the question with which I'm struggling.": "Francine",
  "Religious people... hold a kind and merciful view of life, the faith of the broken, the hounded, the hopeless. Yet too often, they will not extend that spirit to our fellow creatures.": "Matthew",
  "In properly organized groups no faith is required; what is required is simply a little trust and even that only for a little while, for the sooner a man begins to verify all he hears the better it is for him.": "George",
  "We have one life it soon will be past what we do for God is all that will last. ": "Charles",
  "I am convinced we shall succeed. I have faith in this country, because I have faith in its people.": "Horst",

  "Have faith in God. It will make you dig deeper and become a better leader.": "Anne",
  "I seek a deeper truth, but I don't think I have to go to a building designated for worship to find it.": "Ted",
  "I don't know what religious people do. I kind of wished I'd been a Christian with the blind faith that God is doing the right thing. As a Buddhist, you feel like you have more control over the situation, and that you can change your karma.": "Marcia",
  "I can't tell you how Aquinas has enriched and changed my life, my thought. He has helped me to be a better evangelical, a better servant of Christ, and to better defend the faith that was delivered, once for all, to the saints.": "Norman",
  "I gave my parole once, and it has been shamefully violated by the British Government; I shall not give another to people on whom no faith can be reposed.": "Christopher",
  "The faith of the church must be tried by God's word, and not God's word by the church; neither yet my faith.": "Jane",
  "Faith and doubt both are needed - not as antagonists, but working side by side to take us around the unknown curve.": "Lillian",
  "I go to church too, y'all. And I've heard it, too. And I want to say to all of our faith leaders out there that I understand that probably in my Baptist church in Maryland, it is not likely that there will be performed - in my church - gay marriages.": "Donna",
  "The need for some venture of faith still remains one must stake one's life upon something. ": "Henry",
  "I desire an special interest in your prayers that my faith fail not in the day of adversity.": "John",
  "I lost my faith in God when I lost my daughter to Cancer, the beast. I begged, I cried, I offered my life for hers, and day by day, I watched that beautiful little Angel slip off. So, excuse me for not taking my seat next to you on Sunday in Church, I feel too cheated to worship.": "Vince",
  "In Barack Obama, Democrats have put forth a man of strong religious faith who is comfortable connecting his spiritual life to his public role as a policymaker.": "Mike",

  "Scriptures and creeds may come to seem incredible, but faith will still go dancing on.": "Sydney",
  "In Christian terms, evangelization and humanization are not alternatives. Nor are the 'vertical dimension' of faith and the 'horizontal dimension' of love for one's neighbor and political change.": "Jurgen",
  "As your faith is strengthened you will find that there is no longer the need to have a sense of control, that things will flow as they will, and that you will flow with them, to your great delight and benefit.": "Emmanuel",

  "Faith is not belief without proof, but trust without reservation.": "D.",
  "I think the greatest taboos in America are faith and failure.": "Michael",

  "Fashion fades, only style remains the same.": "Coco",
  "You can design and create, and build the most wonderful place in the world. But it takes people to make the dream a reality.": "Walt",
  "Design is not just what it looks like and feels like. Design is how it works.": "Steve",
  "A shoe is not only a design, but it's a part of your body language, the way you walk. The way you're going to move is quite dictated by your shoes.": "Christian",
  "Design is a funny word. Some people think design means how it looks. But of course, if you dig deeper, it's really how it works.": "Steve",
  "The details are not the details. They make the design.": "Charles",
  "An image is not simply a trademark, a design, a slogan or an easily remembered picture. It is a studiously crafted personality profile of an individual, institution, corporation, product or service.": "Daniel",
  "If you don't design your own life plan, chances are you'll fall into someone else's plan. And guess what they have planned for you? Not much.": "Jim",
  "Eventually everything connects - people, ideas, objects. The quality of the connections is the key to quality per se.": "Charles",
  "To design is much more than simply to assemble, to order, or even to edit: it is to add value and meaning, to illuminate, to simplify, to clarify, to modify, to dignify, to dramatize, to persuade, and perhaps even to amuse. To design is to transform prose into poetry.": "Paul",
  "Successful design is not the achievement of perfection but the minimization and accommodation of imperfection.": "Henry",
  "Everything we do is designed, whether we're producing a magazine, a website, or a bridge. Design is really the creative invention that designs everything.": "Henry",
  "Sustainability can't be like some sort of a moral sacrifice or political dilemma or a philanthropical cause. It has to be a design challenge.": "Bjarke",
  "As an architect, you design for the present, with an awareness of the past, for a future which is essentially unknown.": "Norman",
  "Design is how you make your first impression with your consumers. Make sure it is a lasting one.": "Jay",
  "A common mistake that people make when trying to design something completely foolproof is to underestimate the ingenuity of complete fools.": "Douglas",

  "Art has to move you and design does not, unless it's a good design for a bus.": "David",
  "Color does not add a pleasant quality to design - it reinforces it.": "Pierre",
  "Everything we design is a response to the specific climate and culture of a particular place.": "Norman",
  "I'm not into fashion, but I like design. I wear the same shoes every day.": "Tyler,",
  "The critical thing in developing software is not the program, it's the design. It is translating understanding of user needs into something that can be realized as a computer program.": "Mitch",
  "Design is not making beauty, beauty emerges from selection, affinities, integration, love.": "Louis",
  "I think there is always a need for pure design. With pure design, you don't need so much decoration.": "Jil",
  "In most people's vocabularies, design means veneer. It's interior decorating. It's the fabric of the curtains and the sofa. But to me, nothing could be further from the meaning of design.": "Steve",
  "I always consider the settlement of America with reverence and wonder, as the opening of a grand scene and design in providence, for the illumination of the ignorant and the emancipation of the slavish part of mankind all over the earth.": "John",
  "When you design a building, you start from a general philosophy, and you come down, and you start from detail and come up. Only the theoretical architect believes that you can make the concept and then sometime, somebody will come to build it.": "Renzo",
  "I have been wildly enthused about gaming since I was younger, and a career path I chose not to go down but did really consider was getting into programming and game design.": "Trent",
  "A designer knows he has achieved perfection not when there is nothing left to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.": "Antoine",
  "I'm a big believer you should design work around a vast majority of people who want to do the right thing rather than around the tiny minority who might take advantage.": "Gail",
  "A camel is a horse designed by committee.": "Alec",
  "The path to the CEO's office should not be through the CFO's office, and it should not be through the marketing department. It needs to be through engineering and design.": "Elon",
  "The universe we observe has precisely the properties we should expect if there is, at bottom, no design, no purpose, no evil, no good, nothing but blind, pitiless indifference.": "Richard",
  "When I design a wedding dress with a bustle, it has to be one the bride can dance in. I love the idea that something is practical and still looks great.": "Vera",
  "When I studied graphic design, I learned a valuable lesson: There's no perfect answer to the puzzle, and creativity is a renewable resource.": "Biz",
  "A jellyfish is little more than a pulsating bell, a tassel of trailing tentacles and a single digestive opening through which it both eats and excretes - as regrettable an example of economy of design as ever was.": "Jeffrey",
  "Integrating breakthrough technology into everyday products is always a challenge; at the same time, this is exactly how design makes tech products easily adoptable in life.": "Yves",
  "Everyone designs who devises courses of action aimed at changing existing situations into preferred ones.": "Herbert",
  "Advertising is, of course, important because advertise is the final design. It's the last layer that speaks to the customer, that tells them what you have.": "Tom",
  "I'm a big believer in the emotion of design, and the message that's sent before somebody begins to read, before they get the rest of the information; what is the emotional response they get to the product, to the story, to the painting - whatever it is.": "David",
  "Our guiding principle was that design is neither an intellectual nor a material affair, but simply an integral part of the stuff of life, necessary for everyone in a civilized society.": "Walter",
  "A person should design the way he makes a living around how he wishes to make a life.": "Charlie",
  "It's all in how you arrange the thing... the careful balance of the design is the motion.": "Andrew",
  "To design is to communicate clearly by whatever means you can control or master.": "Milton",
  "Pictures, abstract symbols, materials, and colors are among the ingredients with which a designer or engineer works. To design is to discover relationships and to make arrangements and rearrangements among these ingredients.": "Paul",
  "Graphic design is the paradise of individuality, eccentricity, heresy, abnormality, hobbies and humors.": "George",
  "Some men give up their designs when they have almost reached the goal; While others, on the contrary, obtain a victory by exerting, at the last moment, more vigorous efforts than ever before.": "Herodotus",
  "Design is directed toward human beings. To design is to solve human problems by identifying them and executing the best solution.": "Ivan",
  "Designing is a matter of concentration. You go deep into what you want to do. It's about intensive research, really. The concentration is warm and intimate and like the fire inside the earth - intense but not distorted. You can go to a place, really feel it in your heart. It's actually a beautiful feeling.": "Peter",
  "There is no one-size-fits-all solution to the challenges facing our cities or to the housing crisis, but the two issues need to be considered together. From an urban design and planning point of view, the well-connected open city is a powerful paradigm and an engine for integration and inclusivity.": "Richard",
  "I did not direct my life. I didn't design it. I never made decisions. Things always came up and made them for me. That's what life is.": "B.",
  "The principle of the design - the harmony, rhythm and balance are all the same with interior and fashion design.": "Venus",
  "The clothes that I design and everything I've done is about life and how people live and how they want to live and how they dream they'll live. That's what I do.": "Ralph",
  "It is relatively easy to design for the perfect cases, when everything goes right, or when all the information required is available in proper format.": "Donald",
  "In just six weeks from the time the design was started, we had the motor on the block testing its power.": "Orville",
  "A purpose, an intention, a design, strikes everywhere even the careless, the most stupid thinker.": "David",
  "When I design and wonder what the point is, I think of someone having a bad time in their life. Maybe they are sad and they wake up and put on something I have made and it makes them feel just a bit better. So, in that sense, fashion is a little help in the life of a person. But only a little.": "Miuccia",
  "There's design, and there's art. Good design is total harmony. There's no better designer than nature - if you look at a branch or a leaf, it's perfect. It's all function. Art is different. It's about emotion. It's about suffering and beauty - but mostly suffering!": "Diane",
  "Informed clients are better clients, and they make for better design.": "Kelly",
  "If we want users to like our software, we should design it to behave like a likeable person.": "Alan",
  "Your neighbors will be envious of your 3D printer - and if they're not, just print new neighbors. Design them so they'll like to bring you pies, maybe, or want to do your yard work for you.": "W.",
  "Websites are kind of useless. There's so much great web content and design out there, but the ways in which they are being experienced are not being maximized.": "Dhani",
  "Nearly all inventions are not recognised for their positive side either when they're made. So, for example, scientists didn't go out to design a CD machine: they designed a laser. But we got all sorts of things from a laser which we never remotely imagined, and we're still finding things for a laser to do.": "Robert",
  "While I was at college studying design I decided to paint. I was also greatly inspired by the colours that I had seen on my travels in the Brazilian Rain forest.": "John",
  "Recognizing the need is the primary condition for design.": "Charles",
  "The primary factor is proportions.": "Arne",
  "Design in art, is a recognition of the relation between various things, various elements in the creative flux. You can't invent a design. You recognize it, in the fourth dimension. That is, with your blood and your bones, as well as with your eyes.": "D.",
  "It's very difficult to design something for someone if you have no empathy.": "Stewart",
  "So if I design it and then go away, it's still living somewhere and it still exists by itself without me.": "Marc",
  "The design of the Mac wasn't what it looked like, although that was part of it. Primarily, it was how it worked. To design something really well, you have to get it. You have to really grok what it's all about. It takes a passionate commitment to really thoroughly understand something, chew it up, not just quickly swallow it.": "Steve",
  "Design is so critical it should be on the agenda of every meeting in every single department.": "Tom",
  "The computer can't tell you the emotional story. It can give you the exact mathematical design, but what's missing is the eyebrows.": "Frank",
  "It is only after years of preparation that the young artist should touch color - not color used descriptively, that is, but as a means of personal expression.": "Henri",
  "Design is everything. Everything!": "Paul",
  "Design is the method of putting form and content together. Design, just as art, has multiple definitions; there is no single definition. Design can be art. Design can be aesthetics. Design is so simple, that's why it is so complicated.": "Paul",
  "Graphic design, which evokes the symmetria of Vituvius, the dynamic symmetry of Hambidge, the asymmetry of Mondrian; which is a good gestalt, generated by intuition or by computer, by invention or by a system of coordinates, is not good design if it does not communicate.": "Paul",
  "I think it's really important to design things with a kind of personality.": "Marc",
  "Designs are increasingly winning competitions because they are literally green, and because somewhere they feature a small windmill.": "Rem",
  "Design should not dominate things, should not dominate people. It should help people. That's its role.": "Dieter",
  "I would urge everyone to start looking at the world in a different way. Spend some time looking at everyday objects, at their design, their shape, their individual characteristics. Think ahead and imagine their significance.": "Martin",
  "There are two kinds of designers: ones who are very happy locked in their office surrounded by their coterie. The last thing they need to do is to go to a trunk show; they'd go running for the hills. I not only enjoy it, I think, how do you design things that are applicable to life - unless you live it?": "Michael",
  "Over the past 20 years, I have noticed that the most flexible, dynamic, inquisitive minds among my students have been industrial design majors. Industrial designers are bracingly free of ideology and cant. The industrial designer is trained to be a clear-eyed observer of the commercial world - which, like it or not, is modern reality.": "Camille",
  "Once I tried to make a standardization of staircases. Probably that is one of the oldest of the standardizations. Of course, we design new staircase steps every day in connection with all our houses, but a standardized step depends on the height of the buildings and on all kinds of things.": "Alvar",
  "We tell stories with maps about global warming, biodiversity; we can design more livable cities, track the spread of epidemics. That makes a difference.": "Jack",
  "Trying to design the perfect plan is the perfect recipe for disappointment.": "Patrick",
  "Let it be your constant method to look into the design of people's actions, and see what they would be at, as often as it is practicable; and to make this custom the more significant, practice it first upon yourself.": "Marcus",
  "I prefer design by experts - by people who know what they are doing.": "Donald",
  "Well, I never studied design and I went to art school to study art, you know, sculpture and things like that, and ended up making things like sculpture and started making chairs and jewelry together and that's how I started.": "Marc",
  "I'm not really a fashion designer. I just love clothes. I've never been to design school. I can't sketch. I can't cut patterns and things. I can shorten things. I can make a dress out of a scarf.": "Kate",
  "I used to design for my body, which was flat-chested with big hips. That's why my clothes were tight on top with full skirts.": "Betsey",
  "Leopard is an animal design, and my designs come from nature.": "Roberto",
  "A Nicklaus Design golf course is done by the guys in my company that I work with, that have been trained in my vision, and they do what they think I might do. They might come in the office and ask me questions and I'd certainly answer their questions, but I'm not involved in the site visits or anything else.": "Jack",
  "I like design, I like details, to me it is just another form of self-expression.": "John",
  "In regards to being a fashion aficionado, there's a certain amount of taking yourself seriously in the professional world. The self-effacing person can't completely go down the serious road. But I design, and love when things are beautiful.": "St.",
  "I don't like the collusion between high fashion design and high street. You have to know where you stand. I belong to luxury fashion. That's what I've always felt and embraced. I like the best quality, the best fabrics and the most creative field in fashion. I will stay consistent. I belong to this world.": "Hedi",
  "I am equally proud of all of my architectural projects. It's always rewarding to see an ambitious design become reality.": "Zaha",
  "I design for the use of a building and the place and for the people who use it... the reputation for arrogance comes because when work is offered to me, I look whether I can find a genuine interest in quality.": "Peter",
  "America glories in its tradition of the self-made individual. Political candidates compete to be a friend to entrepreneurs, and policymakers, imagining the next Microsoft or Google, design laws to back the innovator in the garage.": "Mark",
  "Modern design becomes the eye catcher because it's out of context, it is something newborn and fresh, something people have never seen before. I mean, that in itself is the way we should sort of stimulate the senses of society, this urban condition.": "Ross",
  "People say I am the king of painful shoes. I don't want to create painful shoes, but it is not my job to create something comfortable. I try to make high heels as comfortable as they can be, but my priority is design, beauty and sexiness. I'm not against them, but comfort is not my focus.": "Christian",
  "Design needs a new relationship with the world, one that is more focused on our planet's needs.": "Yves",
  "My mantra is: 'Good design accelerates the adoption of new ideas.'": "Yves",
  "The best design work is really done when you spend more time with people, when you have the opportunity to be of the same mindset and the same incentives as the founder of the business.": "Yves",
  "I wish someone would ask me to design a cathedral.": "Philip",
  "Good design keeps the user happy, the manufacturer in the black and the aesthete unoffended.": "Raymond",
  "As an artist, as I design and lay out a page, the less-important things, things I want you to spend less time looking at, I draw them very small, maybe even silhouette them. The more-important pivotal scenes, I draw them larger, maybe even a double-page spread.": "Jim",
  "People believe the only alternative to randomness is intelligent design.": "Richard",
  "For some reason I have a visual intuition that allows me to design things in an interesting way, and I don't know where that came from. Because I don't have this formal training, I seem to drift in a different direction.": "David",
  "Design, if it is to be ecologically responsible and socially responsive, must be revolutionary and radical.": "Victor",
  "I've always been a proponent of the idea that technology doesn't matter to game design. The example I always like to point out is 'Tetris,' one of the greatest games ever made.": "Tim",
  "Success isn't something you achieve by accident, but rather by design.": "David",
  "Theories cannot claim to be indestructible. They are only the plough which the ploughman uses to draw his furrow and which he has every right to discard for another one, of improved design, after the harvest.": "Paul",
  "I don't design. I get what I think is a big idea, and I put the idea down. I'm not a designer. I'm a communicator.": "George",
  "I studied graphic design originally. I used to like drawing, and I was quite into technical drawing. I was always interested in the visual medium, but I thought I was going to be an architect or something like that, but it's quite a lonely job.": "Asif",
  "Trends are dangerous; you will fail if you design for them. You cannot follow the work of others. I have my own DNA, my own formula. I always stay true to myself and to the brand.": "Giuseppe",
  "I am going to design... a Station after my own fancy; that is, with engineering roofs, etc.": "Isambard",
  "With imagination and personal creativity, people who sew can design the way they look to suit themselves.": "Issey",
  "'Design' is a word that's come to mean so much that it's also a word that has come to mean nothing.": "Jonathan",
  "I like entertainment and think mastery is good, though I don't feel like a master. If a theme means having a story that's legible, then that's certainly what we do. But we don't treat design as an add-on layer.": "David",
  "Sculptures created from found materials like ice and thorns, driftwood, and even bleached kangaroo bones all presuppose that artistic design will yield to the cycles of time and climate, whether over an hour or a decade.": "Simon",
  "Many are ready, when listening to the inventor, to belittle and deny his achievements so that he will no longer be heard in honourable places, but after some months or a year, they use the inventor's words in speech or writing or design.": "Filippo",
  "Books are better than movies because you design the set the way you want it to look.": "Trent",
  "If you asked a team of expert psychologists and sociological researchers to come up with a design that was sure to infuriate and offend liberals in America, they'd probably come up with what we call the Great Seal.": "Mike",
  "I really see myself continuing to design clothes, fragrances.": "Kim",
  "It is sad that so many designers don't know how to make. CAD software can make a bad design look palatable! It is sad that four years can be spent on a 3D design course without making anything! People who are great at designing and making have a great advantage.": "Jonathan",
  "I love creating things, especially out of metal. There's something truly satisfying about shaping a piece of metal and seeing the impurities peeling away as you weld it into your chosen design.": "Sean",
  "I've always loved to paint - I was studying to do an art degree when I was approached to become a model - and I've being doing some design work as well. I also love just having a quiet time, sitting in my little library at home in Brooklyn and reading or watching documentaries or listening to music.": "Alek",
  "We are spiritual beings whether we want to admit it or not, and inherent in our DNA is a design to return us home - home to our true essence, our greatest self, our limitless self.": "Debbie",
  "Pete Dye introduced me to golf course design back in the 1960's. He came to my hometown Columbus, Ohio to work on The Golf Club.": "Jack",
  "I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today.": "Vera",
  "For one thing, I am still working as an adviser on fashion, design and colour and stuff.": "Mary",
  "I've teamed up with BaubleBar to curate a collection of gorgeous jewelry pieces. I worked closely with the BaubleBar team to design a collection that encompasses my style and all of my go to pieces.": "Ashley",
  "Design accelerates the adoption of new ideas. And many of these ideas are important for designers to show that there is a way. When you see things through that lens, you realize it applies to any industry and any form of design.": "Yves",
  "I've never had anyone define purity. You probably can't define purity. Purity is to live according to original design.": "Josh",
  "Species go extinct because there are historical contraints built into a given body or a given design.": "Kevin",
  "As much as we think of performance management as numeric and thus perfectly quantifiable, it is as much a product of context and social science as the products we design and develop.": "Steven",
  "At the University of Maryland, my first year I started off planning to major in art because I was interested in theatre design, stage design or television design.": "Jim",
  "As a visual person, I love a creative resume. Putting in a little effort on the design side will show that you care about making things look good.": "Sophia",
  "I like to do interior design, I love to quilt, I love to see different colors together, and I love to match things up.": "Mary",
  "Empathy is key in the design process, especially when you start expanding outside of your comfort zone to new languages, cultures, and age groups. If you try to assume what those people want, you're likely to get it wrong.": "Mike",
  "It is not possible to design always the same. How to be different in each different place - that is the most important work and duty of the architect to find out.": "Jean",
  "I describe the design process as like the tip of the iceberg. What you don't see is the long haul: all the endless auditing and things like that.": "Norman",
  "Accessible design is good design.": "Steve",
  "I tried a dozen different modifications that were rejected. But they all served as a path to the final design.": "Mikhail",
  "Language, philosophy, and science are interwoven into the design of words, which are manipulated to create surprising illusions.": "John",
  "The design of 'Love Actually,' the typeface, the basic line of that poster and that DVD cover has been ripped off so many times.": "Martin",
  "When writing for the page, the focus is on the design - how the words appear on the page. I try to make it as direct and simple as possible.": "Rupi",
  "At the pinnacle of great design are products so gorgeous and lust-worthy that you want to lick them: a Porsche 911, Samsung's Luxia TV, an Eames lounge chair or anything by Loro Piana.": "Gary",
  "That's something I learned in art school. I studied graphic design in Germany, and my professor emphasized the responsibility that designers and illustrators have towards the people they create things for.": "Eric",
  "I design for real people. I think of our customers all the time. There is no virtue whatsoever in creating clothing or accessories that are not practical.": "Giorgio",
  "After the Great Depression and after public urging, a nationwide public competition was held to determine a design for a memorial that would honor President Thomas Jefferson's bold vision for westward expansion for America.": "Russ",
  "I believe in empty spaces they're the most wonderful thing. ": "Anselm",
  "Fashion and interior design are one and the same.": "Iris",
  "Through the harsh design of fate, Florida was dealt the unfortunate circumstances of bearing the brunt of not one but two hurricanes, and it appears more dark clouds are poised to visit the Sunshine State.": "Ginny",
  "Genetic design is something we can use to fight the lack of sustainability we humans are forcing on the earth's environment.": "Craig",
  "User-centered design means working with your users all throughout the project.": "Donald",
  "Most companies target women as end users, but few are effectively utilizing female employees when it comes to innovating for female consumers. When women are empowered in the design and innovation process, the likelihood of success in the marketplace improves by 144%!": "Indra",
  "Good design doesn't date. Bad design does.": "Paul",
  "You drift through life and let things happen to you, or go by design and say, 'This is what I'm intended to do.'": "Rick",
  "His father is governor of Media, and though he has the greatest command given him of all the rest of my generals, he still covetously desires more, and my being without issue spurs him on to this wicked design. But Philotas takes wrong measures.": "Alexander",
  "The dreaded phrase in design circles is 'show and tell.'": "David",
  "There are many designers who have much greater talent as a designer than I do, but they may not have my drive, they may not work as hard, they may not have the focus, the desire... You have to have a talent because, at the end of the day, if the pants you design don't make someone's butt look great, they're not going to buy them.": "Tom",
  "There are two methods in software design. One is to make the program so simple, there are obviously no errors. The other is to make it so complicated, there are no obvious errors.": "Tony",
  "All conventional wisdom has an element of truth to it, but good design requires more than an element of truth - it requires an ensemble of correct assumptions and valid calculations.": "Henry",
  "We have contributed through Indian culture; so many international collections are Indian-inspired. Why we don't make an international impact? We have talent, but we have not leveraged it, not married commerce to design.": "Priya",
  "A small change at the beginning of the design process defines an entirely different product at the end.": "Jonathan",
  "The level of detail and craft is something that's inscribed within the original design concept. And so when I begin to draw, I know what kind of detailing I want the building to have.": "Tadao",
  "I come from a different era and I design clothes for our era. I think of people I want to dress when I design.": "Alexander",
  "Design my own line? No, I just like the culture.": "ASAP",
  "I didn't think that personal style had much value in graphic design.": "Stefan",
  "The most important relationship you have in life is the one you have with yourself. And then after that, I'd say once you have that, it may be hard work, but you can actually design your life.": "Diane",
  "Ninety percent of games lose money; 10 percent make a lot of money. And there's a consistency around the competitive advantages you create, so if you can actually learn how to do the art, the design, and the programming, you would be consistently very profitable.": "Gabe",
  "It would have been difficult to design a path out of communism worse than the one that has been followed.": "Aleksandr",
  "Boeing just took $20 billion and 10 years to improve the efficiency of their planes by 10 percent. That's pretty lame. I have a design in mind for a vertical liftoff supersonic jet that would be a really big improvement.": "Elon",
  "Good design should be honest.": "Ferdinand",
  "If you want to communicate something, you'd better make sure that your design piece is well-dressed and that its teeth are fixed. At the same time, I still believe that if it is only stylistically great and it has nothing to say, it still is not going to make a lasting impression on anybody.": "Stefan",
  "I design therefore I become.": "Jason",
  "I would love to design a maternity clothing line. It is so hard to find stylish clothes for pregnant people... I would say 99 percent of the clothes I wore were not maternity because I couldn't find anything I liked.": "Kourtney",
  "Design is a tool that either allows us to create new markets or disrupt existing ones.": "Yves",
  "To design something really new and innovative you have to reject reason.": "Jonathan",
  "I want to design jewelry for girls and guys... I'ma spread it out, but I'ma design, probably when I'm just designing furniture and buildings, I'll probably being the jewelry thing, too.": "Tyler,",
  "About half my designs are controlled fantasy, 15 percent are total madness and the rest are bread-and-butter designs.": "Manolo",
  "The artist in me cries out for design.": "Robert",
  "Once you come up with a premise, you have to work out how it all happened. It's a bit like coming up with a spectacular roof design first. Before you can get it up there, you need to build a solid foundation and supporting structure.": "Linwood",
  "I believe consistency and orthogonality are tools of design, not the primary goal in design.": "Yukihiro",
  "They say that the best furniture and clothing design from the '50s and '60s is Scandinavian or Milanese.": "Christian",
  "So if I want to buy a light in a shop and I don't find a light that I like, I think to myself what would I like? What would I like to buy? Then I started to imagine and design it for myself a lot of the time.": "Marc",
  "People say I design architectural icons. If I design a building and it becomes an icon, that's ok.": "Zaha",
  "When you as a designer design something that burdens a community with maintenance and old world technology, basically failed developed world technology, then you will crush that community way beyond bad design; you'll destroy the economics of that community, and often the community socially is broken.": "Cameron",
  "There are people who design buildings that are not technically and financially good, and there are those who do. Two categories - simple.": "Frank",
  "Apart from photography and music videos, I also do graphic design.": "Anton",
  "Design, to me, is part psychology, part sociology, and part magic. A good decorator should know what's going on in someone's marriage and how their kids are doing in school.": "Nate",
  "I'm always drooling over great design, from fashion to furniture.": "Janina",
  "I have been fully involved in designing my stage shows; it's important to me to do something really unique and almost off-the-wall to bring the music and the visuals together. I love design and actually went to school for a bit for graphic design, so it isn't so much 'pressure' for me; it's a way to be creative, and I really enjoy it.": "Afrojack",
  "It's not enough to have a hacker culture anymore. You have to have a design culture, too.": "Robert",
  "The interesting thing about Android's design is how little we modified the kernel.": "Robert",
  "My popularity has to do with the divorce between modern art, where everything is obscure, and the viewer who often feels he needs a professor to tell them whether it's good or not. I believe a painting has to talk directly to the viewer, with composition, color and design, without a professor to explain it.": "Fernando",
  "I thank Marc Jacobs so much for giving me the opportunity to design a shoe for Louis Vuitton, but the thing that broke my heart most was when they said, 'You're finished. The shoe's finished.'": "Kanye",
  "Airplanes were invented by natural selection. Now you can say that intelligent design designs our airplanes of today, but there was no intelligent design really designing those early airplanes. There were probably at least 30,000 different things tried, and when they crash and kill the pilot, don't try that again.": "Burt",
  "Today, tomorrow and every day, we will see at least 2,000 young children killed or seriously injured on the world's roads. This is unacceptable, preventable, and we have to stop it. We have the vaccines for this disease: helmets, seatbelts, speed enforcement, safe road design. We just need to use them.": "Michelle",
  "You find a story - or more importantly, you find some characters - that you want to be around as a filmmaker. The style and how we're going to shoot it and how we're going to design it and how it's all going to feel and look depends on that story. They tell me how I should shoot it.": "Morten",
  "I credit my mom with inspiring in me a love of design, matched by her creative problem-solving abilities. This is a woman who could find an old, discarded piece of furniture, bring it home and turn it into something fabulous.": "Candice",
  "When the Great Fire of London destroyed most of the medieval city in 1666, Christopher Wren was invited to design a new one. Within days, he had drawn up an elegant grid of broad boulevards leading to majestic squares, but it came to nothing - the existing landowners wanted things as they had been.": "Norman",
  "I'm not like most designers, who have to set sail on an exotic getaway to get inspired. Most of the time, it's on my walk to work, or sitting in the subway and seeing something random or out of context.": "Alexander",
  "My particular aesthetic of light and color and design wouldn't change as a result of working with computer graphics rather than with slit scan or miniatures.": "Douglas",
  "I think gardens are fantastic, and I'd love to draw and design and stuff like that. I love just planting flowers during the summer. There's something very humble about it, and natural and beautiful.": "Ed",
  "Any design, whether it's for a ship or an airplane, must be done in anticipation of potential failures.": "Henry",
  "I do quite like Gehry's Guggenheim. But where in Bilbao it's seen as an outgrowth of years of investment in urban design and engineering, in Britain it's seen as the catalyst for urban regeneration rather than the icing on the cake.": "David",
  "Nike is the uniform for kids all over the world, and African design has been killed by Nike. Africans no longer want to wear their own designs.": "M.I.A.",
  "Outside of the chair, the teapot is the most ubiquitous and important design element in the domestic environment and almost everyone who has tackled the world of design has ended up designing one.": "David",
  "Design is people.": "Jane",
  "Designs in connection with postage stamps and coinage may be described, I think, as the silent ambassadors on national taste.": "William",
  "What is design? It's where you stand with a foot in two worlds - the world of technology and the world of people and human purposes - and you try to bring the two together.": "Mitchell",
  "To whom does design address itself: to the greatest number, to the specialist of an enlightened matter, to a privileged social class? Design addresses itself to the need.": "Charles",
  "Design is a constant challenge to balance comfort with luxe, the practical with the desirable.": "Donna",
  "The design of each element should be thought out in order to be easy to make and easy to repair.": "Leo",
  "Designs of purely arbitrary nature cannot be expected to last long.": "Kenzo",
  "Design is about creating spaces for people to enjoy and of course, creating moments where you elevate the spirit, but 'design for good' is figuring out a program that not only creates better spaces, but creates jobs, creates new industry and really kind of raises the conversation about how we rebuild.": "Cameron",
  "Also note that invariably when we design something that can be used by those with disabilities, we often make it better for everyone.": "Donald",
  "Books are but waste paper unless we spend in action the wisdom we get from thought - asleep. When we are weary of the living, we may repair to the dead, who have nothing of peevishness, pride, or design in their conversation.": "William",
  "The mind is like a richly woven tapestry in which the colors are distilled from the experiences of the senses, and the design drawn from the convolutions of the intellect.": "Carson",
  "A good scientist is a person with original ideas. A good engineer is a person who makes a design that works with as few original ideas as possible. There are no prima donnas in engineering.": "Freeman",
  "The actual tragedies of life bear no relation to one's preconceived ideas. In the event, one is always bewildered by their simplicity, their grandeur of design, and by that element of the bizarre which seems inherent in them.": "Jean",
  "Biological engineering is not necessarily understanding systems but rather, I want to be able to design and build biological systems to perform particular applications.": "Drew",
  "So that ideas of sort of relaxed symmetry have been something for years that I have been concerned with because I think that symmetry is a neutral shape as opposed to a form of design.": "Robert",
  "If I designed a computer with 200 chips, I tried to design it with 150. And then I would try to design it with 100. I just tried to find every trick I could in life to design things real tiny.": "Steve",
  "The garden, by design, is concerned with both the interior and the land beyond the garden.": "Stephen",
  "It's about the power of design and the power of the human spirit. It's above paying anybody to do something stupid for money like reality television does - like ambushing people.": "Genevieve",
  "The scientific argument advanced for intelligent design at the Dover trial, those arguments collapsed, scientifically and intellectually.": "Kenneth",
  "God is His own Design and End, and that there is no other Worthy of Him.": "Mary",
  "Design can never be an ultimate explanation for anything. It can only be a proximate explanation. A plane or a car is explained by a designer but that's because the designer himself, the engineer, is explained by natural selection.": "Richard",
  "I've always loved interior design.": "Genie",
  "Designing is my hobby. If I didn't do what I do for a living - at some point when I don't do this for a living - I'll probably just do design work. I love finding really special pieces of furniture.": "Ellen",
  "To be able to design for the plus-sized consumer, for me, that's just beyond. It's a dream.": "Khloe",
  "When you say 'design,' everybody thinks of magazine pages. So it's an emotive word. Everybody thinks it's how something looks, whereas for me, design is pretty much everything.": "James",
  "I love the idea of couture and its emphasis on creation. There's where I made my name - in design - and there's where I'd like to stay.": "Jimmy",
  "Classical design is a mirror of the human mind. It's how we see the world.": "Robert",
  "As the world's 'most dynamic' cities seek to manage their own urban growth, American state and local officials have much to offer. Our mayors can share their experiences in urban design, clean energy projects, Smart Grids, codes for energy efficient buildings, transportation safety, and innovative environmental solutions.": "Robert",
  "A business woman needs a successful mix of design and practicality.": "Donatella",
  "Architects feel empowered to give opinions about politics and sociology and philosophy without knowing much about it. Kind of in the same way that they think they can design furniture or fashion or utensils for dining.": "Rafael",
  "Biomimicry is basically taking a design challenge and then finding an ecosystem that's already solved that challenge, and literally trying to emulate what you learn.": "Janine",
  "There are really two things that have to occur in order for a new technology to be affordable to the mass market. One is you need economies of scale. The other is you need to iterate on the design. You need to go through a few versions.": "Elon",
  "What I love most about Her Majesty is that she has kept hats alive in people's minds for more than 60 years. You can't think of her without imagining her with a hat or a crown. I would, of course, love to design one for her.": "Philip",
  "Architects design buildings; that's what we do, so we have to go with the flow; and, even though I'm still an old Leftie, global capitalism does have its good side. It's broken down barriers - the Berlin Wall, the Soviet Union - it's raised a lot of people up economically, and for architects, it has meant that we can work around the world.": "Richard",
  "A greater focus on design in all new homes would make the best use of land, create homes and public spaces, and reinforce the structures of urban life.": "Richard",
  "Each season I strive to design a forward-thinking and effortless collection with a very clean minimalist aesthetic.": "Francisco",
  "Unlike traditional nursing homes, Green House homes provide elders with a high quality of life and quality of care in a setting that feels like a real home. By altering the facility size, interior design, staffing patterns and service-delivery method, the Green House model provides residents better, safer and more personalized care.": "Risa",
  "I wouldn't know how to design. I couldn't even if I wanted to, for I can't draw, and a pair of scissors in my hands becomes a dangerous weapon.": "Jean",
  "By far the most difficult skill I learned as a C.E.O. was the ability to manage my own psychology. Organizational design, process design, metrics, hiring and firing were all relatively straightforward skills to master compared with keeping my mind in check.": "Ben",
  "I'm experimenting in public. At the design grad schools, these are people sitting around in groups, putting their work on a wall, analyzing it and putting it back in a drawer. I think there's little risk in that.": "David",
  "You cannot design shoes if you only think about fashion; it's too realistic. When I design, I dream.": "Giuseppe",
  "I feel that every day, all of us now are being blasted by information design. It's being poured into our eyes through the Web, and we're all visualizers now; we're all demanding a visual aspect to our information. There's something almost quite magical about visual information. It's effortless; it literally pours in.": "David",
  "I learned that the first technology appeared in the form of stone tools, 2.6 million years ago. First entertainment comes evidence from flutes that are 35,000 years old. And evidence for first design comes 75,000 years old - beads. And you can do the same with your genes and track them back in time.": "Zeresenay",
  "I love to design and remodel houses, from working with the contractors to picking the colours, materials, kitchen and bathroom accessories to finally what furniture goes where.": "Olivia",
  "Apple's Industrial Design team is harder to get into than the Illuminati, and part of the reason is because no one leaves. In the last 15 years, not one of the 18 designers has ditched Apple for greener pastures.": "Jonathan",
  "Costume design is so important and really helpful, and I really love that aspect of character development, just figuring it out.": "Katherine",
  "My personal fascination with the power of the crowd has been growing: Exactly what can a 'crowd' accomplish? We know crowds can raise billions of dollars, create Wikipedia, and even design and build small autonomous drones. But how about something large and complex like designing a new car, and maybe someday even a spaceship?": "Peter",
  "Design is nothing if not decision making.": "Henry",
  "After I left school, where I studied art, photography and textiles at A-level, I started doing an apprenticeship in interior design, but I wasn't really enjoying it very much, so I decided to do something creative, and in 2009, I began blogging.": "Zoe",
  "Why should we build very large spaces when they are not necessary? We can design halls spanning several kilometres and covering a whole city, but we have to ask, what does it really make? What does society really need?": "Frei",
  "Often, we think that things are the way they are because of intelligent design - because somebody super-smart, or some group of academics, came up with the best system ever to do XYZ. Actually, things are often the way they are because of an accident of history.": "Leila",
  "There's a fun, nostalgic aspect to Legos - people connect to the art on a different level. But it's also a medium that lets me design anything I can imagine. I especially enjoy creating curvy forms using rectangular pieces. Up close, you notice the sharp angles, but when you back away, the corners blend into curves.": "Nathan",
  "Good design to me is both appearance and functionality together. It's the experience that makes it good design.": "Michael",
  "I weirdly love interior design and real estate and all of that. I really do. I get chills from it.": "Kendall",
  "Write out the story - rapidly, fluently, and not too critically - following the second or narrative-order synopsis. Change incidents and plot whenever the developing process seems to suggest such change, never being bound by any previous design.": "H.",
  "Everything else - music, cinematography, costumes, design, acting - can be judged at face value. But when you're looking at editing, you don't know what the totality of the material was, and you don't know the working dynamic between a director and an editor - whether the editor was micromanaged or given free rein. It's very difficult.": "Christopher",
  "I have the same sense of discovery and exhilaration from objects of design and everyday use - I am inspired by the buildings in my city, by park greenery and dazzling store windows, by the jaunty strollers and umbrellas and billboards I walk past. Just strolling our streets, we encounter creativity every single day.": "Agnes",
  "If a major source of the nation's news is personalizing user experiences, people with different points of view will end up in echo chambers of their own design. Facebook didn't create that problem, but it shouldn't aggravate it.": "Cass",
  "There is a design behind the world that we are living in, which is veiled to most of us most of the time, but every once in a while, you catch a glimpse of it.": "Mark",
  "By coincidence and not design, 'Everstar' is written and drawn by an all-female creative team, and it makes me smile to think that there may be young female readers out there, future writers and artists, who get to see that comics doesn't have to be a 'boys' club.'": "Mark",
  "If I wanted to do clothes or if I wanted to make a building or design a choreography, you are able to do that - they are all under a similar kind of design umbrella.": "Zaha",
  "If I knew for a certainty that a man was coming to my house with the conscious design of doing me good, I should run for my life.": "Henry",
  "If there is a gay uniform, the differences are in how each man coordinates the details: the brand and cut of the jeans, the design of belts and boots, the haircut, the number and size of earrings.": "Lance",
  "Now I design what I want to wear, and it works that way.": "Alexander",
  "Nothing I do is by design. It's always the result of a happy accident. I didn't have a career plan. It has just become the way it is. It's all good fun.": "Lena",
  "When I concentrate on a specific site or place for which I am going to design a building, I try to plumb its depths, its form, its history and its sensuous qualities.": "Peter",
  "In fashion design, you can divide people into two groups. You have people who come with an aesthetic that is there forever, even if it evolves. Then you have people I call 'jumpers.' One season it can be this; the next season it's completely something else. I always knew I am more of a jumper.": "Raf",
  "You can almost say that a design error is a human error because, after all, it's we humans who do the designing.": "Henry",
  "Design is a vital component to the enrichment of our everyday lives. Japan has a very rich history and culture of design, and I feel it is a very important dialogue to open and keep evolving.": "Issey",
  "As the Industrial Age is drawing to a close, I think that we're witnessing the dawn of the era of biological design.": "Craig",
  "I'm an artist, so I love the graphic design of Instagram.": "Pierce",
  "I love the way my tattoos look. I especially love Japanese-style tattoos and being completely sleeved by them, so it's not just these little individual and unrelated pieces, but everything's working together to create a larger design.": "Nikki",
  "The problem with State of the Union speeches is that they are, by their nature and design, alphabet soup. It's hard to know what a president really cares about when they run down a laundry list and check every issue box under the sun for fear they will offend some constituency if they don't.": "Mark",
  "Google has withdrawn from China, arguing that it is no longer willing to design its search engine to block information that the Chinese government does not wish its citizens to have. In liberal democracies around the world, this decision has generally been greeted with enthusiasm.": "Peter",
  "It's aggravating that Hollywood has never gotten credit for the role it played in promoting modern design.": "Camille",
  "I like to hike and cook. I enjoy furniture and design - not making it, just looking at it. I'm always kind of trying to spread my interests around and try new things.": "Kevin",
  "But I'm blessed to work with great people. I collaborate with brilliant stylists both here and in Paris. I work with a great design team. I really allow everyone to bring their ideas. I almost rely on them to inspire me.": "Marc",
  "It's one thing to make financial aid available to students so they can attend college. It's another thing to design forms that students can actually fill out.": "Cass",
  "All I've ever wanted to do is design and make it's what I love doing. ": "Jonathan",
  "I find that when I write, I need things to be quiet, but when I design, I can't bear it if it's quiet.": "Jonathan",
  "I'm always up for collaborating with brands and people who actually design, but doing your own line is a whole other beast. I don't think I could deal with the criticism.": "Travis",
  "I don't design down to a price.": "James",
  "One of the biggest differences between you and a traditionally published author is that a self-pubbed author is responsible for everything. Not just writing the book - but cover design, editing, producing, distribution, and publicity as well.": "M.",
  "You have to have talent to design and to dress thousands of women or millions of women around the world. And you know very well, the only thing they want is to look more beautiful.": "Carolina",
  "There's a perennial debate about whether the propagandistic tripe produced by establishment media outlets is shaped more by evil or by stupidity. Personally, I think it's both: a healthy dose of each is needed. The system design is malicious, while those who serve as its public face are generally vacant.": "Glenn",
  "I love cities, I spend most of my life talking about cities. And the design of cities does have an effect on your life. You're lucky if you can see trees out of your window and you have a square nearby, or a bar, a cornershop, a surgery. Then you're living well.": "Richard",
  "I don't design my own clothes. It's so not what I think about.": "Colleen",
  "I truly believe that we're about to enter a second golden age of design. The first one was in the '50s and '60s, when designers like Raymond Loewy, Charles Eames, George Nelson and Dieter Rams were shepherds of the brands they were working with. They had influence over the products and how companies communicated and promoted themselves.": "Yves",
  "There are so many women throughout the world who appreciate beautiful design and have the budget to buy designer fashion but sometimes have a hard time finding the things that they really want or that suit their lifestyle or their culture or whatever it may be.": "Aslaug",
  "The illusion of purpose and design is perhaps the most pervasive illusion about nature that science has to confront on a daily basis.": "Lawrence",
  "You'll never see me with a precision flick of eyeliner. Messy eyeliner became my thing by accident rather than design. If you can't get it straight, then just work it in around your eyes.": "Edie",
  "If you depend on a secret for your security, what do you do when the secret is discovered? If it is easy to change, like a cryptographic key, you do so. If it's hard to change, like a cryptographic system or an operating system, you're stuck. You will be vulnerable until you invest the time and money to design another system.": "Whitfield",
  "The first 10 years of my professional life had only to do with running away from my father. He was a wonderful cabinet-maker, and me being the eldest son, I had to take over his shop, his profession and so on and so on. I tried to escape by going to art school and then going on to industrial design and then interior design.": "Peter",
  "If you have 50 different plug types, appliances wouldn't be available and would be very expensive. But once an electric outlet becomes standardized, many companies can design appliances, and competition ensues, creating variety and better prices for consumers.": "Bill",
  "The typical project design time for a large company like IBM - and they keep track of this - is a little over four years.": "Bill",
  "The great majority of Baghdad is a slum - a lot of it's new, but it's still slum. It's usually this concrete-block, one-room design with a door and a window, arranged one-up, one-down, often with a shop with nothing in it on the first floor, and then a one-room apartment above it. There's street after street after street of that stuff.": "P.",
  "It was Einstein's dream to discover the grand design of the universe, a single theory that explains everything. However, physicists in Einstein's day hadn't made enough progress in understanding the forces of nature for that to be a realistic goal.": "Stephen",
  "I was at Emily Carr College of Art and Design in Vancouver for four years, and I loved it.": "Douglas",
  "I don't act, I don't direct, I don't design.": "Tom",
  "I have a notebook, and I know what decisions will be made in pre-production. Everything is pre-determined in the pre-production period. I visually design the whole thing, and I know when things will happen.": "Alejandro",
  "Designers are very fickle. I never wanted to be a victim of that. You're in one minute, out the next.": "Tyra",
  "There's a simple arithmetical logic at work. Build more unaffordable and not always architecturally sympathetic apartments, watch the rents rise, the tarts leave, the small shops, production offices and design studios close down, and hey presto, we have another fashionable London suburb indistinguishable from the rest.": "Howard",
  "Economic engineering is about the design and analysis of frameworks for achieving specific economic objectives.": "Ben",
  "I spearhead interior design for all Trump projects.": "Ivanka",
  "Most of the things at the zoo don't look like us. We're one design that works. Our chimp pals sort of look like us, so that's a different take on the same basic design. But fish don't look like us, and giraffes don't. They look a little like us, but not too much. And insects certainly don't look like us, and they work just fine.": "Seth",
  "I'm a designer, and I think if you work in fashion, you have to give people fantasy.": "Christian",
  "I'd already decided I wanted to design shoes after I saw a sign in the Museum of African and Oceanic Art forbidding high heels. Well, who could resist?": "Christian",
  "I never was interested in being part of the fashion world - I just wanted to design shoes. I didn't even know 'Vogue' existed when I was growing up. 'Vogue,' what is that?'": "Christian",
  "I have no problem with the idea of comfort, but it is not an important thing aesthetically. If you look at a shoe and immediately say it looks very comfortable, in terms of design, it is not going to excite me. Of course, I am not putting nails in my shoes to ensure everybody is in pain, but a heel is not a pair of slippers and never will be.": "Christian",
  "I never wanted to design clothes. I never wanted to work for the fashion industry. Shoes sort of belong to the fashion industry, which is why I'm part of the fashion industry. But that's never been my thought. My thought since I was a child was really to design those shoes for girls on stage.": "Christian",
  "I never wanted to work in fashion. At age 12 or 13, I wanted to design for showgirls - for the theater! And I was crazy for the Hollywood of the 1950s: Dietrich, Elizabeth Taylor, Jennifer Jones. They were my idea of glamour - and Sylvie Vartan, the French singer.": "Christian",
  "At age 12 or 13, I wanted to design for showgirls - for the theater!": "Christian",
  "Gorillas are still wild creatures. That's made very clear when you observe them in nature. They charge and perform other displays that are terrifying by design. But they don't attack unless they feel threatened.": "Andy",
  "My mom modeled and made clothes, so I always had such an appreciation for design.": "Blake",
  "Design, whether it's on your body or in your home, is the same thing. It's mixing different colors, different textures, and unexpected patterns - elements that you wouldn't often put together in an interesting way.": "Blake",
  "I'm a total control freak and love to participate in the design of every single aspect of life.": "Drew",
  "All those lessons that I've learned on the court, I have applied them to my life outside of the court in business, my company, called V Starr interiors, an interior design company, and EleVen, which I wear on court.": "Venus",
  "My style is kind of eclectic and I don't like to do the same thing over and over again. I like to have fun and explore myself so you won't see the same design.": "Venus",
  "I love design.": "Venus",
  "There's so many interesting aspects of making a movie: the costume department, the set design, the casting itself, the locations.": "Jason",
  "In a biological system, the software builds its own hardware, but design is critical, and if you start with digital information, it has to be really accurate.": "Craig",
  "When you think of all the things that are made from oil or in the chemical industry, if in the future we could find cells to replace most of those processes, the ideal way would be to do it by direct design.": "Craig",
  "Agriculture as we know it needs to disappear. We can design better and healthier proteins than we get from nature.": "Craig",
  "Sometime in the future, I am a hundred percent certain scientists will sit down at a computer terminal, design what they want the organism to do, and build it.": "Craig",
  "Trends in fashion, design and pop culture are taking on more global influence, and of course, one thing that's always in style is color.": "Brad",
  "I have too much product, and I'm trying to rein it in and sell more of my main collection. I wish you didn't have to design so often; it would be good if you could keep on selling the same things for a few years and not have to do new things all the time.": "Vivienne",
  "I wish you didn't have to design so often. Try to do quality and cut down on quantity. I think fashion is very, very important.": "Vivienne",
  "The thing that makes my clothes really different is that, number one, they are really great designs; they're not tacky; they are very professional; the design is made from lots of decisions.": "Vivienne",
  "I design things to help people to hopefully express their personality.": "Vivienne",
  "Steve Jobs was the greatest manufacturer of consumer products of his age. His marketing vision put him on par with Henry Ford, and his grasp of the aesthetic component to industrial design far surpassed Ford's.": "Timothy",
  "In design as in life, smart can also mean wise, kind, inspiring - and cost-effective. And that has a charm all its own.": "Nancy",
  "I love French auto design of the early '50s, '60s, early '70s of Citorens, Renaults, and Peugeots. They're so unique.": "John",
  "Because I am much like Reagan and Margaret Thatcher, I'm such an unconventional political figure that you really need to design a unique campaign that fits the way I operate.": "Newt",
  "Unfortunately, some women want to remake their husbands after their own design.": "Gordon",
  "The possibility that terrorist groups could obtain weapons of mass destruction should not be dismissed as a fiction. This is a horrific threat the international community should take seriously. As long as these weapons exist, so, too, does the risk of their use - by accident or design.": "Ban",
  "Although people often equate them, glamour is not the same as beauty, stylishness, luxury, celebrity, or sex appeal. It is not limited to fashion or film; nor is it intrinsically feminine. It is not a collection of aesthetic markers - a style, as fashion and design use the word.": "Virginia",
  "We've gone from a world in which Starbucks set a cutting-edge standard for mass-market design to a world in which Starbucks establishes the bare minimum. If your establishment can't come up with an original look, customers expect at least some sleek wood fixtures, nicely upholstered chairs, and faux-Murano glass pendant lights.": "Virginia",
  "The profusion of fonts is one more product of the digital revolution. Beginning in the mid-'80s and accelerating in the 1990s, type design weathered the sort of radical, technology-driven transformation that other creative industries, including music, publishing, and movies, now face.": "Virginia",
  "Everything that I design I would wear myself.": "Victoria",
  "Most of the robots being developed for home use are functional in design - Gecko's homecare robot looks rather like the Star Wars robot R2-D2. Honda and Sony are designing robots that look more like the same movie's 'android' C-3PO.": "Peter",
  "My affliction has been... I can make something or draw something or design something better than I can explain it.": "Brad",
  "I'd like to design something like a city or a museum. I want to do something hands on rather than just play golf which is the sport of the religious right.": "Brad",
  "I might want to open a hotel and design all the rooms. Or maybe a museum that lets me curate all the events.": "Theophilus",
  "Sacred spaces can be created in any environment.": "Christy",
  "Video games and YouTube.com are creatively booming, even though Web design, as demonstrated by the ugly clutter of most major news sites, is in the pits.": "Camille",
  "Well, I design costumes because I started with the theater in Chicago, but somehow a few lines just sort of fell to me to do it. And I studied it in school and I always liked it.": "John",
  "You can be a mason and build 50 buildings, but it doesn't mean you can design one.": "John",
  "I'm deeply and passionately involved in the design process. I'm a brash American, and if my name is going to be on something, I'm going to have my say.": "Meghan",
  "Summer blockbusters are very expensive to make. They have things that have to be expensive, such as 600 effects shots or CG characters that have to go a certain way, or a film design that is different but expensive.": "Ang",
  "We spent a lot of time trend forecasting and collaborating on ways to design a fresh line of fashion-forward, affordable luxury.": "Kourtney",
  "We always say we are a brand for our fans because through social media we're so lucky to see what people are asking us for, what they're looking for, and so we really design what we like but also take our fans in mind.": "Kourtney",
  "We do have a two against one rule. If two sisters feel very strongly about a design or trend we want to try, we go for it.": "Kourtney",
  "Designing was always something I was interested in. I studied fashion design in high school as well as how to sew.": "Kourtney",
  "The promise I've tried to honor my entire career, that the rule of law and the design of the founders, right, the oversight of courts and the oversight of Congress will be at the heart of what the FBI does.": "James",
  "The new Zune may not be an iPod killer, but it does offer a clean interface, great industrial design, HD radio, and a subscription model for music, making it significantly less expensive for big users.": "Douglas",
  "When he entered the Oval Office - by fate, not by design - Citizen Ford knew that he was not perfect, just as he knew he was not perfect when he left. But what president ever was?": "Tom",
  "We had the Windows app store in Windows 8, but one of the big changes in the design of Windows 10 is to make sure that the app store is front and center where our usage is, which is the desktop.": "Satya",
  "The stylish kids on the street, they're the ones that set the trends. The designers see what they're doing and go and design their line and sell it back to the same kids, and it's like, why not go directly to the source?": "Rihanna",
  "Whether it's an $11 flip-flop or a $2 key ring or a $2,000 dress, they're all done with integrity. They're all done with a design sense. As long as the creativity exists, then I don't think it's a sellout. A sellout is putting your name on any piece of crap and then expecting people to buy it because it's got your name on it.": "Marc",
  "Design is a series of creative choices - it's a collaborative effort, an evolutionary process. You choose your fabrics depending upon what you want to say, then you work with mills to get those fabrics. Through the process, you realize what you want it to be.": "Marc",
  "Marc Jacobs is full of creative people and Louis Vuitton is again a name on the door, a name that has existed for many years but I'm a collaborator there and I bring in other people, other artists and I work with a great creative design team.": "Marc",
  "I'm not really well educated - other than an art survey course at the High School of Art and Design in New York when I was, like, 15. I don't know the history of art, but I got over intimidation from the art world when I realized that I was allowed to feel whatever I want and like whatever I want.": "Marc",
  "We don't design by calculator or by demographics or anything like that. We really are a group of creative, sensitive people. We have our charmed little world where we get to make things. We're really lucky.": "Marc",
  "The big deal about the Internet design was you could have an arbitrary large number of networks so that they would all work together.": "Vint",
  "There are two main methodologies of open source development. There's the Apache model, which is design by committee - great for things like web servers. Then you have the benevolent dictator model. That's what Ubuntu is doing, with Mark Shuttleworth.": "Matt",
  "The themes in WordPress drive a lot of design trends. It democratizes design... You make a theme, and suddenly it's on hundreds and thousands of sites.": "Matt",
  "For much of its existence, design was all about convenience. We wanted to hide technology so that users are not distracted into thinking about the tools they use.": "Evgeny",
  "When government programs aren't working, those on the Left tend to support more funding, while those on the Right want to scrap them altogether. It is better to ask whether the problem is complexity and poor design. We can solve those problems - sometimes without spending a penny.": "Cass",
  "When you're learning, especially to write, unless you're some incredibly gifted writer, a young Malcom Gladwell, say, you need to be imitating people. You need to be imitating how they make their work, how they structure it, how they design the pieces. It gives you chops; it gives you moves.": "Ira",
  "While a case can be made for intelligent design, I can't figure out why some Christians are so thrilled about that possibility. First of all, it doesn't prove there's a God. If anything, intelligent design lends support to some form of pantheism that defines God as immanent within nature.": "Tony",
  "I design all my sets. With my tour and my album artwork, I co-design that with people who are better at drawing than me. But I've got a good imagination. I went to art school so I understand how to communicate my ideas.": "Paloma",
  "I design music I don't produce it. ": "Travis",
  "I love to paint. And I have another profession - an interior design business.": "Mary",
  "I'd love to design bridal dresses.": "Lauren",
  "I love to design. I am a commercial fashion designer. I always design jackets with two sleeves. I don't design jackets with three sleeves, or the layers and layers come off like little dolls from Russia. Fashion for me is a creative endeavor, but it is not art for me.": "Tom",
  "The dynamics of film directing and fashion design - in the ways that I've done it - were not dissimilar.": "Tom",
  "As a designer, design director or any creative person, you have to hire great people, support them and make them feel comfortable so they can contribute and give you their best.": "Tom",
  "I hate going out for lunch during a workday because it slows down my pace and ruins my rhythm. I prefer to eat at my desk. Actually, I wander around the design studio with a plate in my hand as I dine on, for example, salmon sashimi and a salad of tomatoes and mozzarella. I often have a bit of dark chocolate after lunch.": "Tom",
  "Whether one believes in evolution, intelligent design, or Divine Creation, one thing is certain. Since the beginning of history, human beings have been at war with each other, under the pretext of religion, ideology, ethnicity and other reasons. And no civilization has ever willingly given up its most powerful weapons.": "Mohamed",
  "It's a very strange thing for a designer to say, but one of the things that really irritates me in products is when I'm aware of designers wagging their tails in my face.": "Jonathan",
  "I discovered at an early age that all I've ever wanted to do is design.": "Jonathan",
  "Perhaps I'd like to design cars, but I don't think I'd be much good at it.": "Jonathan",
  "Apple's goal isn't to make money. Our goal is to design and develop and bring to market good products.": "Jonathan",
  "The emphasis and value on ideas and original thinking is an innate part of British culture, and in many ways, that describes the traditions of design.": "Jonathan",
  "Eight years of work can be copied in six months. It wasn't inevitable that it was going to work. A stolen design is stolen time.": "Jonathan",
  "I like to work in a small team. There is only 18 of us on the design team. Nobody has ever left.": "Jonathan",
  "When something's made in the smallest volume - as a one-off couture piece - or in large quantities, deep care is critical to determine authentic, successful design and, ultimately, manufacture.": "Jonathan",
  "We struggle with the right words to describe the design process at Apple. But it is very much about designing and prototyping and making.": "Jonathan",
  "Deep in the culture of Apple is this sense and understanding of design, developing, and making. Form and the material and process - they are beautifully intertwined - completely connected.": "Jonathan",
  "My focus is incredibly narrow. I can't talk with any authority other than design and development of product.": "Jonathan",
  "That's just tragic, that you can spend four years of your life studying the design of three dimensional objects and not make one.": "Jonathan",
  "I design for the woman who loves being a woman.": "Diane",
  "I never like to think that I design for a particular person. I design for the woman I wanted to be, the woman I used to be, and - to some degree - the woman I'm still a little piece of.": "Diane",
  "A challenging economy is always good for design. It unites necessity and functionality. You are forced to be creative with poor materials.": "Diane",
  "The way I design generally is very much travel-oriented because that is my life. That's why I make clothes that are so light and so easy to pack and a little bit seasonless.": "Diane",
  "My favorite days are the ones where I deal only with my own team, design, marketing, working on the next accessories collection.": "Diane",
  "Technology's related to everything. Technology is making the world more accessible, so yeah, as generations go by, they'll become more and more married to each other, for sure. I think they go hand in hand - fashion inspires design, and technology inspires design as well.": "Justin",
  "For me, I've always believed that there was a God. I've always believed that God created the heavens and earth - so, for me it's not a huge leap from there to intelligent design.": "Ben",
  "In our interconnected world, novel technology could empower just one fanatic, or some weirdo with a mindset of those who now design computer viruses, to trigger some kind of disaster. Indeed, catastrophe could arise simply from technical misadventure - error rather than terror.": "Martin",
  "And we should keep our minds open, or at least ajar, to concepts on the fringe of science fiction. Flaky American futurologists aren't always wrong. They remind us that a superintelligent machine is the last instrument that humans may ever design - the machine will itself take over in making further steps.": "Martin",
  "I was at art school that had quite a celebrated film course as well. I tried for that film course when I was 18, but they said I was too young. I tried this audio and visual design course instead. Two years later, I reapplied for that higher course, but they said I was still too young and to try in five years.": "Edgar",
  "I love the '60s and sort of wish all design had stopped in 1967. That would be my dream. They were really just nailing it - everyone looked great - but then it started getting a bit slippery after that.": "Alexa",
  "I help design my own tennis clothes.": "Maria",
  "I have always had an interest in fashion and design and I appreciate style and timelessness within my footwear and accessories both on and off the court.": "Maria",
  "Ever since I was young I loved making things and being part of the design process.": "Maria",
  "Music is where I have the most creative freedom, but I love producing. To me, that's kind of where all the action is. You get a chance to have your hands in every aspect of a film. From picking a director, sometimes picking a writer, to the actors, the wardrobe, set design, editing, music, and marketing.": "Ice",
  "I wanted to design a line based on Hollywood's Golden Era. I talked with Stephen Burrows and with Willi Smith and with one or two other people, but it just seems like such a hard field to break into. I need someone like Calvin Klein's manager to get behind me!": "Aretha",
  "I'm not thinking about the next record really yet. I kind of want to do a bunch of stuff with Jonathan Zawada, the guy who did the album art. I'd like to do some crazy art installations and design some weird synthesizers and work with other people and make some fun stuff for a bit. Maybe tap into virtual reality stuff or maybe write another record.": "Flume",
  "I'd like to do some crazy art installations and design some weird synthesizers and work with other people and make some fun stuff for a bit. Maybe tap into virtual reality stuff or maybe write another record... We'll see.": "Flume",
  "I don't think I have a sense of fashion. But I do have an aesthetic, which I feel is an offshoot of me working in the design industry. For example, if I am mixing and matching prints on my sofas and cushion covers, I tend to do that with my wardrobe as well.": "Twinkle",
  "I really love muscle cars. I don't think people might realize that about me. I really want to go to an auto auction and blow my life savings on a Camaro. They have such design around them, such panache.": "Alex",
  "Eighteenth century American furniture and the design of the architects Greene and Greene are my special love.": "Barbra",
  "I definitely want to design clothes at one point.": "Kendall",
  "Value Proposition Design is a 'must have' for anyone creating a new venture. It captures the core issues around understanding and finding customer problems and designing and validating potential solutions.": "Steve",
  "Many people think that being a graphic designer means going to an expensive art school and buying expensive software that will cost you thousands of dollars. This is so far from the truth. There are hundreds of online education centers that offer top-notch graphic design training.": "Fabrizio",
  "I always kept the fans happy. They always saw a different Rey, whether it was a mask, a design, a color. I never gave them the same thing twice and always kept them on their feet. They were always excited to see what Rey was going to bring to the table.": "Rey",
  "I am always updating and coming up with something fresh, whether it's a colour, a trend, or a design, as my uncle always taught me to be unique and different.": "Rey",
  "I'm not into politics but I am committed to a cause: ensuring design technology and engineering stays on the U.K. curriculum, alongside science and maths - grounding abstract theory, merging the practical with the academic.": "James",
  "I don't particularly follow the Bauhaus school of design, where you make everything into a black box - simplify it.": "James",
  "Women are all the same; we want to be smaller in the waist, longer legs, slimmer. I design for women and their defects, to make them better.": "Donatella",
  "When I meet celebrities, I have to know what they are like and only then can I design. The clothes have to fit their personality.": "Donatella",
  "In its heyday, the car was an expression of technical flair and design genius: the original Mini, the Beetle, the 2CV, and the Fiat 500 were all, in their various ways, inspired incarnations of functionality.": "Martin",
  "Watching my dad, Ralph Lauren, design clothes when I was young, I was always inspired.": "Dylan",
  "I love Janet Jackson and her creative set design.": "Dylan",
  "Whether by design or circumstance, every startup will eventually get disrupted.": "Jay",
  "We are bodies which think, and we're at home with steampunk because it is an ethos of design and creativity which acknowledges the humanly physical: that which we can understand with our fingers.": "Nick",
  "Every actor wants to win an Oscar, full stop. It doesn't mean you try to design things around how to accomplish that because that's impossible.": "Julia",
  "God didn't design anyone to be recognized by 2 billion people.": "Peter",
  "Hey, I'm a good software engineer, but I'm not exactly known for my fashion sense. White socks and sandals don't translate to 'good design sense'.": "Linus",
  "I design all of my costumes. I like to go out there and feel like I have contributed to every part of what I do. I choose the music, the choreographer, I've obviously chosen my coach, my costumes - all if that falls under my realm of power, my realm of influence.": "Johnny",
  "If you see a player out in public having dinner, chances are he's with his boring money manager or some boring rich guy he hopes to design a golf course for.": "Dan",
  "My job at the end of the day is to design timeless, desirable, beautiful products. It's not about just designing a bunch of organic jumpers. I have a balance within the brand. If you try to create something people enjoy, and it happens to be made in a responsible way, then that's when you can really strike an incredible balance.": "Stella",
  "I think the fact that my parents weren't conventional - especially considering their position - had a big influence on the way that I conduct myself now in design and business. It had a huge impact on my wanting to do something a bit more than just designing a pretty dress and putting it on a runway and making it glamorous.": "Stella",
  "My job is to make desirable, luxurious, beautiful clothing and accessories women want to buy. My first decision is always based on, 'Can I do this in a more sustainable way without sacrificing design?' If I can, then there is no reason not to.": "Stella",
  "I graduated from Academy of Fashion and Costume Design in Rome. At first, I thought I was going to be a costume designer for films, and then I ended up working in fashion - not as a designer, but mostly as a model.": "Isabella",
  "With the clothes I design, I think about my friends, how I'd want them to dress, what I'd want them to wear.": "Jeremy",
  "Design is not for philosophy it's for life.": "Issey",
  "My design is no design.": "Issey",
  "I gravitated towards the field of clothing design, partly because it is a creative format that is modern and optimistic.": "Issey",
  "People interact with their phones very differently than they do with their PCs, and I think that when you design from the ground up with mobile in mind, you create a very different product than going the other way.": "Kevin",
  "I've always been a bit of a decorator. I think if I wasn't a singer I'd probably be in stage setting or interior design or something. I like clutter and I'm quite visually greedy. I can't have things to be plain I have to have things looking interesting... maybe I'm just a frustrated interior designer stuck in a singing career. ": "Florence",
  "At the most basic level, prioritizing design also represents a practical consideration. It's far easier to design first and engineer later.": "Ryan",
  "There is no city in America that has reduced crime as much as we have in the last three years. This is not the product of accident. This is the product of design.": "Rudy",
  "In a way, advertising, for all its shallowness, its love of design, its modishness and its self-justification, is curiously innocent. The idea of the hidden persuader or the manipulator is largely absurd.": "Justin",
  "I like the idea of people who've had some success in one form secretly wanting to be something else; I have some of that myself. I look for it in other people who've established themselves in some particular art form, and then you find out that they really would like to design running shoes, or edit literary magazines or something.": "William",
  "I would like to design what people generally call streetwear. I'd like to dress skateboarders, or whatever the older equivalent of skateboarders are. I pay more attention to that stuff than anyone would ever imagine because I'm watching what the designers do.": "William",
  "By divine design, men and women are intended to progress together toward perfection and a fulness of glory. Because of their distinctive temperaments and capacities, males and females each bring to a marriage relationship unique perspectives and experiences.": "David",
  "You can design a mortgage system that is different without a Fannie and Freddie, but there are principles you have to have, to have a good system.": "Jamie",
  "I've wanted to design golf courses ever since I was a kid. I suppose it comes from the way I've played the game. To find the proper way to play any hole, I've always begun by asking myself what the architect has tried to do with it.": "Jack",
  "I love design in general, the creativity. Whether it is golf courses, my apparel line, ads we do or our business with AriZona, design is fun.": "Jack",
  "If I had one golf course, from a design standpoint, one that I really love, it would probably be Pinehurst. There's a totally tree-lined golf course where trees are not a part of the strategy.": "Jack",
  "The fears you do not face become your walls. Most people in business, and in their personal lives, design everything so they can avoid doing what makes them feel uncomfortable. Yet any good business person knows we are not only paid to work, but also we are paid to be scared.": "Robin",
  "If I were a rock star, I'd design my own clothes. I'd do it because that's the mark of a true rock star.": "Shawn",
  "I've been called the journeyman. It's really more by default than it is by design.": "Chris",
  "The fact I've been in every lineup of Yes has been more by default than design.": "Chris",
  "Delay always breeds danger and to protract a great design is often to ruin it. ": "Miguel",
  "What we're looking at is God's design, nature's template, and using that as a pattern to cut around and lay it down on a domestic model to duplicate that pattern that we see in nature.": "Joel",
  "The way I define 'intelligent design' is that when people started out, we wanted to make sense of the world we lived in, so we created stories about how things worked.": "George",
  "Can you design a Rorschach test that's going to make everyone feel something every time - and that looks like a Rorschach test? It's easy to show a picture of a kitten or a car accident. The question is, how abstract can you get and still get the audience to feel something when they don't know what's happening to them?": "Jason",
  "I want to design my own clothing line. I'm very into fashion. It's something I really want to focus on when swimming is over.": "Ryan",
  "By no definition of any modern scientist is intelligent design science, and it's a waste of our students' time to subject them to it.": "Lawrence",
  "What I've learned from different designers is that it's key to be true to who you are and your vision. That's always been my line of thinking. Working through the whole design process, I don't want to create something I wouldn't be proud to wear.": "Kellan",
  "Many, many times I find that whatever is looking good on the screen doesn't always look or feel good on the body. So who do we design for - do we design for the screen, or do we design for women?": "Alber",
  "'Commercial' is not the word that has to be said only by CEOs. It has to be something that is maybe the essence of design, because design has some sort of art in it and creation, but it's also some object that you have to use. There is also this pragmatic end to it.": "Alber",
  "When you're 8 years old, and you've become subconsciously familiar with the layout and design of Black Sparrow books, and you know the difference between Miles Davis and John Coltrane, something is bound to stick.": "Patrick",
  "After working with clothes for so long, it seemed right to design them.": "L'Wren",
  "Deep down, creationists realize they will never win factual arguments with science. This is why they have construed their own science-like universe, known as Intelligent Design, and eagerly jump on every tidbit of information that seems to go their way.": "Frans",
  "I mean, I think about it, but I don't design my record to get a certain public response.": "Liz",
  "There really are so many lines of work that you can join that don't have to only be design. And that was one that particularly interested me a lot, because the editors could appreciate all the trends, all the designs and all the work of the designers.": "Nina",
  "I was obsessed with fashion when I was young. I thought fashion meant fashion design, and I thought I wanted to be a designer at some point.": "Nina",
  "Film gives us the luxury of deciding where the viewpoint of the audience is, and by knowing that, we can very effectively design around what is actually seen on camera.": "Freddie",
  "YouTube's a funny place because so many creators fall into their aesthetics out of necessity and the visuals are driven out of an urge to create. You get a lot of interesting examples of interesting design choices that have roots in practicality as well as an artistic sentiment.": "Freddie",
  "My closet is organized by tops, pants, and outerwear, but not a lot of dresses. Gowns are in another room because I don't often dress formally, even though I design gowns. Like most designers, I have a uniform, and mine is a legging.": "Vera",
  "All those years of skating and dancing have carried over. I can't design anything without thinking of how a woman's body will look and move when she's wearing it.": "Vera",
  "I like the gritty parts of fashion, the design, the studio, the pictures.": "Vera",
  "Let's be realistic, how many people are buying a $2,000 skirt? I love to design things that people can actually buy. I'm staggered by what a boot costs today.": "Vera",
  "I try to absorb all types of style and design. I don't try and restrict my thinking. I enjoy the old and the new. You need that broad perspective to create something different.": "Chad",
  "From time to time, I've experimented with sculpture or metal design. It's a good break from just sitting behind the keyboard.": "Chad",
  "Schoolchildren are not taught how to distinguish accurate information from inaccurate information online - surely there are ways to design web-browsers to help with this task and ways to teach young people how to use the powerful online tools available to them.": "Howard",
  "The i730 combines the familiarity of Windows Mobile software with the innovative design of Samsung that will be a popular choice for mobile professionals.": "Suzan",
  "It would be nice to design a real briefcase - you open it up and it's your computer but it also stores your books.": "Steve",
  "If you wanted to design a robot that could learn as well as it possibly could, you might end up with something that looked a lot like a 3-year-old.": "Alison",
  "There's a lot of books that I've purchased simply because of the cover design. On the other hand, there's certain books that, even if I'm very curious about the content, I can't bring myself to buy if I really dislike the cover.": "Adrian",
  "So, I'm always around video games but I've always been interested in them from a visual perspective, with the graphic design and that whole thing. I don't know if that comes from my love of photography or what but that's always what's held my interest about them.": "Sophia",
  "When you buy things that are expensive, like a sofa or something that really feels like an investment, you need to keep it as plain as possible, as simple as possible. Make sure that it's a clean design that will work with whatever style you want it to.": "Nate",
  "Books are the heart of any home, and I spend hours going through books for design inspiration.": "Nate",
  "When I take on a design project, I have to jet from the bookstore to the hardware shop to the lamp store and back again just to collect a small portion of the many items I need to fill a home. But, when you hit the flea market, they're all right there. From booth to booth, you have the bases covered.": "Nate",
  "First and foremost, I'm a decorator and product designer. Everything I do, the television shows, the books, that comes from the design work. It's what I love.": "Nate",
  "We all have our preferences - some people go for birds - but for me, there's just something about the wolf; the design of it is really aesthetically pleasing.": "Sarah",
  "My actual first summer internship was in the design department of Clinique.": "Aerin",
  "I'm a very visual person, and I love opening beautiful books on art or design and looking through them.": "Aerin",
  "We go to movies to be taken away to another place, to be dazzled, to dream, to hopefully be filled with wonder. The design of the world and the look of the film is all in service of trying to create that feeling of wonder in the audience.": "Lee",
  "We hope 'Toy Story 3' looks amazing but still retains the character design of the first film. I like to think it looks like 'Toy Story' would have looked back then had we had the skills and the technology.": "Lee",
  "When I was a very little boy, I lived underneath the air pattern of LaGuardia airport in New York and I watched the planes fly to their destinations. I was in love with the design of these airplanes.": "John",
  "I realised I've got quite a talent for coming up with ideas for design. I've got so many ideas about fashion.": "John",
  "I rarely go into a shop on holiday, because fashion and design are what I'm involved in every day. I need another world.": "Carolina",
  "I love Pinterest! Pinterest is absolutely phenomenal when you're trying to come up with a costume design.": "Ashley",
  "Clothes and jewellery should be startling, individual. When you see a woman in my clothes, you want to know more about them. To me, that is what distinguishes good designers from bad designers.": "Alexander",
  "I can design a collection in a day and I always do, cause I've always got a load of Italians on my back, moaning that it's late.": "Alexander",
  "Embedded in 'The New York Times' institutional perspective and reporting methodologies are all sorts of quite debatable and subjective political and cultural assumptions about the world. And with some noble exceptions, 'The Times,' by design or otherwise, has long served the interests of the same set of elite and powerful factions.": "Glenn",
  "With increasing fervor since the 1980s, sustainability has been the watchword of scientists, environmental activists, and indeed all those concerned about the complex, fragile systems on the sphere we inhabit. It has shaped debates about business, design, and our lifestyles.": "Jamais",
  "Preventing global warming from becoming a planetary catastrophe may take something even more drastic than renewable energy, superefficient urban design, and global carbon taxes.": "Jamais",
  "I'd love to design a school.": "Nolan",
  "I have an all-Japanese design team, and none of them speak English. So it's often funny and surprising how my ideas end up lost in translation.": "Pharrell",
  "I went to art and design high school with a lot of people taking fashion. They would get up in the morning, and what they put on meant a lot to them.": "Amy",
  "I attended Art & Design High School, and at one point, you had to write about what you wanted to be when you grew up. I wrote that I wanted to be a writer for 'Mad' magazine.": "Amy",
  "We are actors who show up for work in our sloppy gear, and we've got this extraordinary tailor. It's someone else who's done the design; someone else who's cut the suit; someone else who's measured it. Basically, your job is to just wear it.": "Colin",
  "Design is important, it's an important dimension in the car. It's not the only one.": "Carlos",
  "I approve designs not because I think I am more gifted or somebody who can see ahead three or four years from now, but just to make sure that the design is a logical, rational decision, taken after analyzing pros and cons.": "Carlos",
  "When I come to a design decision, people know that is that.": "Carlos",
  "Puma was all about function and not at all about design. The founder of the company always believed functionality and performance were the only ingredients that could make Puma successful and design never mattered.": "Jochen",
  "I find, in merchandising and design and creative, a business school degree isn't particularly helpful.": "Mickey",
  "Steve Jobs, if he had lived, was gonna design an iCar. I think cars have an extraordinary opportunity for cool design.": "Mickey",
  "Apple has beautiful design, beautiful product, incredibly functional. But mostly, it's about picking product, getting behind it, marketing it, and introducing it to a customer. What they've done just inspires me.": "Mickey",
  "First, as I've always said, it all starts with product, which means having the right assortment, styles, and fits. Second is price, where we strive to offer the best quality, style, and design at a fair value. This is critically important, given the highly promotional environment we are operating in. And third, traffic.": "Mickey",
  "I have high hopes that GIS will become increasingly relevant for landscape architects as we make the tools easier to use for the design process of just inventory and mapping.": "Jack",
  "I want to have all that scientific information that we're building be used in designing the future so that people who make geographic decisions - and here it's not just land-use planners, but it's everyone: foresters, transportation engineers, people who buy a house - can analyze all of these information layers and design a future.": "Jack",
  "AppStudio is a native app builder that allows you to build the app and automatically deploy it on Android, iPhone, and Windows. It lets you design it once and then implement it anywhere.": "Jack",
  "A lot of people don't get it, but I design from the inside out so that the finished product looks inevitable somehow. I think it's important to create spaces that people like to be in, that are humanistic.": "Frank",
  "The accumulated knowledge of materials, computing, electromagnetism, product design, and all the rest that we've learned over the last several centuries converts a few ounces of raw materials worth mere pennies into a device with more computing power than the entire planet possessed fifty years ago.": "Ramez",
  "Writing generally, it may be said that in design, roof, and general aspect, Japanese Buddhist temples are all alike. The sacred architectural idea expresses itself in nearly the same form always.": "Isabella",
  "Book-jacket design may become a lost art, like album-cover design, without which late-20th-century iconography would have been pauperized.": "James",
  "The emphasis on innovation and technology in our companies has resulted in a few of them establishing global benchmarks in product design and development, manufacturing practices and human resource capabilities. However, there is no room for complacency.": "Baba",
  "From an operational perspective, exports challenge companies to design, develop, manufacture and supply products to discerning customers in global markets. This, in turn, motivates companies to scale up the value chain, which results in higher realisations.": "Baba",
  "Before 2000, we were unable to design a single car; all the cars were designed in Japan, Europe or somewhere else. We were just converting.": "Baba",
  "McSweeney's as a publishing company is built on a business model that only works when we sell physical books. So we try to put a lot of effort into the design and production of the book-as-object.": "Dave",
  "Even before I was discovered in 1966, I used to make my own clothes. I learned how to sew early on, and it's still my passion now. I constantly have ideas in my head about clothes so jumped at the chance to do my own collection and am very hands-on. Everything I design, I wear and I love.": "Twiggy",
  "I'd love there to be more larger models, but it's just not going to happen. Designers love to design for slim girls.": "Twiggy",
  "Wearing a bold print gets harder as you get older. It's safer to stick to subtle prints or block colours. I have always found prints quite tricky. My daughter Carly, who is on the design team at Stella McCartney, is obsessed with them.": "Twiggy",
  "I always design the hat with the wearer in mind; otherwise, it's an inanimate object.": "Philip",
  "I'm representative of 21st century Irish design, so I promote Irishness all over the world wherever I go.": "Philip",
  "No wonder the film industry started in the desert in California where, like all desert dwellers, they dream their buildings, rather than design them.": "Arthur",
  "I don't know whether the universe contains any evidence of intelligent design, but I can assure you that thousands of everyday products do not.": "Gary",
  "Until I was eighteen, I did not know that you could study fashion design or art. I really didn't know. I already had my nose in the art world; I was already looking at things, but I didn't really get it that you could study that because my school was a very different environment.": "Raf",
  "As an industrial designer, you design the thing by yourself, and then it goes away from you, whereas fashion is in constant relation to the body and to psychology. It makes it more complicated, and it makes it more challenging.": "Raf",
  "I think the good thing about Dogme is that it forces you into an extreme sense of reality because there's no artificial light and no set design and all of those icings on the cake that you usually have on a movie.": "Susanne",
  "I think a lot of times people design restaurants with flash in mind. I think you should design restaurants with function in mind. Make sure it's functional and works with what you're trying to accomplish. Design can come later.": "Bobby",
  "There's a lot of shoes that people consider high-end fashion, from Balenciaga to this and that or whatever, and the Pro Models are very similar to me. They're very fashionable to me - the design and the shape of them. I just like them.": "Big",
  "The visual aspect of a dish is so important the shapes and colors and overall design have to strike the right mood and convey the right idea. ": "Daniel",
  "If you have total freedom to design, you won't get anything interesting. So I give myself restraints in order to kind of push myself through, to create something new. It's the torture that I give myself, the pain and the struggle that I go through.": "Rei",
  "My design process never starts or finishes. I am always hoping to find something through the mere act of living my daily life. I do not work from a desk and do not have an exact starting point for any collection.": "Rei",
  "God is not an American. Nature did not design Americans to be prosperous forever.": "Richard",
  "I design all of the costumes for my movies, actually.": "Xavier",
  "One thing I longed to do was to design a complete look, from head to toe, so I started a make-up line in 1966.": "Mary",
  "After doing some research with my agent, we found out Klipsch was an official Colts partner, and they were based in Indianapolis, which only added to my esteem for the company. I also have a passion for design and technology that developed while I was at Stanford and appreciate the quality of Klipsch's speakers and headphones.": "Andrew",
  "What we do in the laboratory is we try to design drugs that will not just eradicate cancer cells but will eradicate their homes.": "Siddhartha",
  "There is an interior style we intellectuals and design policy wonks know as Haut Euro Pooftastic, which really takes the biscuit.": "Peter",
  "All brands, whether high-ticket luxury ones such as Cartier or Rolls-Royce or 'masstige' ones with luxe-y overtones but altogether more affordable, all want to grow. Even brands that may have started in a modestly niche design and lifestyle fashion can find themselves under pressure to go global or to sell out at the top.": "Peter",
  "Programs like ACE's Bootstrap Summer Camp teach our kids important computer coding skills that will allow them to design their own futures.": "Gina",
  "Independent graphic novelists have already achieved good work in terms of design, but all these great minds are writing in English. There is a need for people to write in Hindi.": "Anurag",
  "If I had to design a career for myself, I would have done comedy.": "Rene",
  "It is a shame that homebrew development can't be officially sanctioned and supported, because it would be a wonderful platform for a modern generation of programmers to be able to get a real feel for low level design work, to be contrasted with the high level web and application work that so many entry level people start with.": "John",
  "Developing games for the PC and consoles is all about everything and the kitchen sink. In many ways, you don't have design decisions to make. You do it all. So I enjoy going back to making decisions about what's important as I'm working on a game.": "John",
  "My stylist has really great taste - Petra Flannery has really great taste. I mean, I am opinionated, and as time goes on, as I've gotten to see more dresses or more clothes, it's easier to say, 'I like that' or 'I don't like that,' but it's nothing I would ever, you know, design.": "Emma",
  "When we were in the design studio I always was pretending like I was in a closet asking my friend before I step out into the world what do I look like? And everybody wants that honest friend before they go and go to dinner or go to an event.": "Nicole",
  "I am extremely involved in the design process of both my brands, Winter Kate and House of Harlow 1960.": "Nicole",
  "I think a lot of people overlook the importance of the menu as a marketing tool and a way of communicating to the customer what the ambition of their restaurant is. Not only the typeface and the design, but what is it printed on? Is it cheap-looking? Is it the right kind of paper for that restaurant?": "Joe",
  "The reward is that you can actually create a world separate from reality with a story, actors, music, and camera design. When it works it can entertain, move people and teach us all.": "Colleen",
  "The exposure I have had to beautiful materials across the world, from Japan to Italy, enables me to pull design ideas together. This, combined with years of historical research, has created a great fountain of ideas for me.": "Colleen",
  "For contemporary fashion, I'm a huge fan of so many of the people out there. I think Azzedine Alaia holds up through three generations of very specific, beautiful design. I think Jean Paul Gaultier also is very interesting with a long span.": "Colleen",
  "I worked in fashion, but I worked more in the sales side of fashion than in design. I was an assistant buyer for a department store back in the '70s and the early years of Saint Laurent. And I used to have a lot of private clients that I bought for.": "Colleen",
  "I think that sometimes people don't understand that a costume that has to be worn every day and doesn't change the whole movie becomes iconic. It's very important because it requires a different design process, since you have to make something that people aren't going to get tired of looking at.": "Colleen",
  "I grew up in a small town in Washington State, so I wasn't really aware of costume design as a career growing up, but I loved clothes. I remember I saved all my money, and the first thing that I bought was a white blazer, which was to the horror to my parents. But I have always had a strange connection with clothing.": "Colleen",
  "I can create clothes for so many different time periods. I've always tried to avoid being pigeonholed. Plus, everything I learn about design and costume from one movie somehow works its way into something else.": "Colleen",
  "One thing about costume design - and I think design in general - but especially costume design, is people have a misconception that it's very glamorous work.": "Colleen",
  "My own style is pretty classic I much prefer to design for others. ": "Colleen",
  "Costume design allows you to do a different type of research and create characters, whereas in fashion, you create an image and clothing for the masses.": "Colleen",
  "I design for the movie and the character as well as the person wearing the costume. I show the ideas to the actor, then do fittings for shape and technical things such as movement in the costume. Once the costume in this form is on the actor, you have a sense of their connection with it. I then take it to the next level with the final fit.": "Colleen",
  "I really don't over-theorize about design. I'd rather feel it than talk it to death. A lot happens as you unroll the design.": "Colleen",
  "I think fan fiction is the way most writers start, and the same goes for music and design.": "Malorie",
  "British innovation in design, in the creative arts, in engineering and manufacturing is world class.": "Margaret",
  "Keep it simple, stupid. Good game design shouldn't keep you looking at the manual but should have enough depth where you feel like you bring something new to the game every time you play.": "Rob",
  "When I sit down and design, it's shoes that always appear.": "Edgardo",
  "I design flats like I design heels: They must be seductive, beautiful and comfortable.": "Edgardo",
  "Being inspired is one thing, but completely knocking off a design is another. There is a big difference.": "Edgardo",
  "Sometimes you design a shoe, and you think this one is a winner, but you never know when something will be such a crazy phenomenon.": "Edgardo",
  "Proponents of intelligent design don't accept that some of the very complex nanomachines that we have inside ourselves could have come about solely on the basis of natural selection.": "Francis",
  "I am tremendously excited to introduce a unique 'Metal Gear Solid' experience to a new audience of gamers as well as collaborate with my mentor in game design, Mr. Miyamoto, on 'Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes' for Nintendo GameCube.": "Hideo",
  "Growing up, Guess always had these amazing billboards and cool affordable clothing. I wore it then, and I still wear it now! It's come full-circle. When I design the clothes, I have a very good team around me, showing me different pieces and cuts.": "Tiesto",
  "People who run a ready-to-wear company are businessmen rather than production or design people.": "Calvin",
  "I've always made weird sounds with my mouth. I've always been fascinated by the sound design, what you can do with your mouth. I was the kid dancing around in third grade on the basketball court. While everyone would be playing sports, I would be jumping around.": "Charlie",
  "I learn my lines while on the golf course. I try to do two or three things at once. I have ideas for books all the time, I have ideas for paintings all the time, and I write them all down. I take my sketchpad and my iPad, which I design on, and I do sit down and do specific tasks at specific times.": "Jane",
  "Through no divine design or cosmic plan, we have inherited the mantle of life's caretaker on the earth, the only home we have ever known.": "Michael",
  "Although my art work was heavily informed by my design work on a formal and visual level, as regards meaning and content the two practices parted ways.": "Barbara",
  "Even when I was a little girl, I remember going to the Museum of Modern Art. I think my parents took me there once or twice. And what I really remember is the design collection.": "Barbara",
  "Luckily I don't have to buy shoes anymore, because I design them! I'm off tour, so I can dive in and create the shoes that I want for my line. But okay, I did buy a pair of vintage combat boots because they were so beaten up - I had to have them.": "Fergie",
  "Building design isn't trendy.": "Kevin",
  "I'm not too fond of really cool design. I've got quite kitsch taste really, in things like tableware. I'm quite a sucker for 1930s pressed glass.": "Kevin",
  "I was lucky enough to create my own dress, deciding on every single design detail. But, even if you don't have a custom dress, you can still create a signature wedding-day look with personalization - a belt, altering the sleeves, etc. But, when creating your bridal style, the most important thing to remember is to make it feel like you.": "Margherita",
  "Snohetta promotes a more democratic workplace atmosphere than most other architectural offices. This may merely reflect prevalent employment practices in Scandinavia, but Snohetta places a stronger emphasis on group participation in the design process than typical high-style firms.": "Martin",
  "From the outset, MoMA followed the Bauhaus's strict prohibition against design that even hinted at the decorative, a prejudice that skewed the pioneering museum's view of Modernism for decades.": "Martin",
  "Always beware an unsigned architectural design.": "Martin",
  "Any set of decisions about design is inevitably influenced by cultural prejudice, no matter how intent an architect might be to avoid it.": "Martin",
  "I design a lot of things that I wear onstage, but I'm always looking for unique stuff. I like creative things, so anything I can find at a secondhand costume shop to a Helmut Lang store, it doesn't matter - just unique stuff.": "Amy",
  "The universe began in an instant, is expanding, and exhibits design, order, and complexity. Every effect must have a Cause, and design must have a Designer.": "Ray",
  "By fundamentally changing how we design the places and systems that enable our daily lives, we can slash emissions way beyond the immediate carbon savings - because our own personal emissions are just the tip of a vast iceberg of energy and resources consumed far from our view.": "Alex",
  "I'm fascinated with design. I realized early that I had no talent in that direction, but I love talking with architects and designers about what they do. I appreciate applied creativity as a source of pleasure and meaning.": "Alex",
  "I was a cartoonist when I was at university, but I decided to go into movie making knowing that I could still draw by doing movies, design work, story boards, and such.": "Robert",
  "Something I've really enjoyed learning more about is course design.": "Ernie",
  "I majored in fashion design in school, and I have always wanted to design my own line of clothing, jewelry, and stuff like that; so this was just a step for me in that direction.": "Diana",
  "There has to be the popcorn genre element, or I don't engage the same way. I like action and vehicle design and guns and computer graphics as much as I like allegory. It's a constant balancing game. I want audiences to be on this rollercoaster that fits the Hollywood mould, but I also want them to absorb my observations.": "Neill",
  "I grew up as an artist. Science fiction allows for design and creatures and guns and all the stuff that I like as well. So I think most of the films I make, I'm sure, will be in that category. But I can also see myself making a film like 'Black Hawk Down,' and I could also totally do horror.": "Neill",
  "I went to high school in Ellicott City, Maryland, and I felt pretty ambivalent about the whole thing. It just took time away from my doing things on the Internet - like creating clans in Quake II or starting a Web design nonprofit. In school, I was just a kid. Online, I had authority.": "Alexis",
  "The age of recalcitrance is over. The best solution is no longer just to regurgitate a 19th-century design.": "Thom",
  "I studied literature design and fashion design.": "Danielle",
  "The basic problem is that web 2.0 tools are not supportive of democracy by design. They are tools designed to gather spy-agency-like data in a seductive way, first and foremost, but as a side effect they tend to provide software support for mob-like phenomena.": "Jaron",
  "The wisdom of crowds works when the crowd is choosing the price of an ox, when there's a single numeric average. But if it's a design or something that matters, the decision is made by committee, and that's crap. You want people and groups who are able to think thoughts before they share.": "Jaron",
  "Health care is a design problem. Dependence on foreign oil is a design problem. To some extent, poverty is a design problem. We need design thinkers to solve those problems, and most people who are in positions of political power are not design thinkers, to put it mildly.": "Dan",
  "It's funny now how much we look at - whatever you want to call it: art, design, culture stuff, film - online, and how in the online world, you're instantly global.": "Mike",
  "I was just taught very early that if I didn't solve problems, I was headed for a very dark path. Problems were everywhere. Now, even if there are no problems, I look for problems. I'm like, 'You know what? I don't like the way this spoon works. I want to design a new spoon.'": "Homaro",
  "The craftless anarchy of the Beat poets on the one hand, and the extreme control of Henry James on the other, suggest that for most human beings, just as both freedom and discipline are necessary in life, serendipity and design must coexist in a work to make it readable.": "Mark",
  "How can you look at the Texas legislature and still believe in intelligent design?": "Kinky",
  "Don't feel you have to buy something to sit in or at. Buy something you are emotionally attached to and build your design around that. One Matisse cutout poster could provide you with your whole color scheme!": "Alexandra",
  "Each time I invent something and have it manufactured, it's so incredibly exciting that I can't imagine ever wanting to stop. Envisioning new products is easy for me. I just don't have enough time in the day to design them all.": "Joy",
  "It's easy to design expensive products. But there's that product democracy that I believe very strongly in to make something affordable for almost anybody that would want to use it.": "Joy",
  "I actually started as a model builder and quickly progressed into production design, which made sense because I could draw and paint. But I kept watching that guy over there who was moving the actors around and setting up the shots.": "James",
  "The Japanese have a wonderful sense of design and a refinement in their art. They try to produce beautiful paintings with the minimum number of strokes.": "David",
  "What's skateable is limitless by design.": "Rob",
  "I have always loved clothes, and the opportunity to design my own line could not be missed. It's a dream job.": "Jasmine",
  "I had been elected to the National Academy of Design in New York, and one of the requirements was that you give a portrait, a self-portrait of yourself.": "Jamie",
  "Because every design must satisfy competing objectives, there necessarily has to be compromise among, if not the complete exclusion of, some of those objectives, in order to meet what are considered the more important of them.": "Henry",
  "It seems to be a law of design that for every advantage introduced through redesign, there is an accompanying unintended disadvantage.": "Henry",
  "I have always been fascinated by the way things work and how they came to take the form that they did. Writing about these things satisfies my curiosity about the made world while at the same time giving me an opportunity to design a new explanation for the processes that shape it.": "Henry",
  "We call the fates of the Titanic and the Concordia - as well as those of the space shuttles Challenger and Columbia - 'accidents.' Foreseeing such undesirable events is what engineers are expected to do. However, design trade-offs leave technological systems open to failings once predicted, but later forgotten.": "Henry",
  "No design, no matter how common or seemingly insignificant, is without its adamant critics as well as its ardent admirers.": "Henry",
  "I am always looking for ways to move technology away from being over-featured. Moving to Silicon Valley in the mid-1990s meant I grew up as a designer in an environment where technology is a tool and not a means to an end. I believe that design should be driven by ideas, not style.": "Yves",
  "I have been working with Hive, part of British Gas, on reinventing the thermostat. Now you can control your heating at the press of a button on your phone. As I say, design should permeate every part of society.": "Yves",
  "Design certainly has a cosmetic, aesthetic aim. It always aims at making things beautiful. But relevance is just as important. I often say, 'If it isn't ethical, it can't be beautiful. But if it isn't beautiful, it probably shouldn't be at all.'": "Yves",
  "When clients come to my design agency and say 'I want to be the Apple of this or that,' we say 'Okay, are you ready to be the Steve Jobs?' Few are up to the task.": "Yves",
  "What I learned from my years in Silicon Valley is that design can have a primary role in how a business is shaped, how a company can be design-driven. In my experience of large industry in Europe, that knowledge has been lost.": "Yves",
  "I think every business, really, has a unique reason for being, unique assets, unique attributes, a unique history. And that can be turned into a very attractive design story, essentially, that consumers can relate to.": "Yves",
  "I'm interested in technology for the masses. Good tech design should not just be for enthusiasts but for the general public. It should be something that touches everyone.": "Yves",
  "Juicero is the first company to make cold-pressed juice something that people can make themselves at home. The challenges to design and engineer a press that can deliver 8,000 pounds of force are tremendous.": "Yves",
  "Having one foot in design and the other in sustainable and social projects, I hear this question quite often: 'Why does the world need another chair?' My answer is that the world needs another chair/bicycle/car or any new product for that matter, like the world needs another book.": "Yves",
  "I am passionate about what design can do - how far it can support the new ideas and the new ways of living of this 21st Century. Good design accelerates this exciting future where manufacturing is local, materials and processes are cradle to cradle, business models are both socially and financially driven.": "Yves",
  "I'd like to be able to design as easily as if I was using Photoshop. I'd like to be able to create a multicolumn layout and control source order without having to do advanced mathematics or hire Eric Meyer or Dan Cederholm to figure out the CSS, because I can't.": "Jeffrey",
  "I could open a thousand Excel documents and still never think to scroll past a wall of empty rows to see if, hidden beneath them, there is a tab I need to click. Just doesn't occur to me. Because, design.": "Jeffrey",
  "At one point, I was blogging prodigiously, in the late '90s; and I was getting, like, millions of pages because I was, like, one of the only people writing about web design, and I was always writing about web design.": "Jeffrey",
  "CSS is the design language of the web, and it is not as easy to use as it ought to be, and it can be confusing, especially if you are new to it.": "Jeffrey",

  "I tell my workshop students, 'I want you to think of yourselves as artists. Then, when you're writing, you're painting, you're crafting, you're making a design, you're sculpting, you're creating choreography, sound, a sound script.'": "Juan",
  "I knew a lot about product design before coming to Apple, but I didn't understand a lot about consumer experience design, which is really Apple's forte.": "Tony",
  "Nest really came out of a process where I was trying to design the most connected and the most green home that I knew of. I was curious of just about everything that goes into a home and building a home.": "Tony",
  "I say homes are for families, and you have to make sure you design for the family, not just one person: kids, your wife, your grandparents need to be able to use it.": "Tony",
  "If you don't have an emotionally engaging design for a device, no one will care about it.": "Tony",
  "There's a big gaping hole in the EDM space for songwriting. It's one thing to learn how to be a great sound designer and become big just on sound design. Especially if you're in the dubstep category, it's like, how much fatter and more interesting can you make those drops.": "Steve",
  "Most of my ideas come from drawing patterns across conversations I have with different types of people - technology investors, young fashion design students, a CEO. This variety is stimulating and offers many different perspectives on the things I am thinking about.": "Imran",
  "We have to design a health delivery system by actually talking to people and asking, 'What would make this service better for you?' As soon as you start asking, you get a flood of answers.": "Paul",
  "I am excited to partner with Aeropostale for my very own collection. It was a great experience to be able to work with them. Not only did I get to design an entire fashion line, but I got to do it at a great price point with quality clothes, both of which are very important to me.": "Bethany",
  "I've always wanted to design a home collection line because growing up, I was obsessed with reorganizing my room.": "Bethany",

  "If you're a devoted collector of design, you seek out objects you can love to live with but also live in.": "Dasha",
  "My dream job would be to design a sexy maternity collection, maybe also beautiful lingerie for expecting women. It's impossible to find nice sexy lingerie anywhere for pregnant or nursing women, which is when you actually need an extra boost of confidence and feel sexy.": "Julia",
  "If I design another line, I will definitely design pieces that suit both pregnant and non-pregnant women. Being pregnant is one of the most amazing things, but it is a big change in a woman's life and body, and I think it is important she feels amazing all along her term. And being able to wear beautiful lingerie will definitely help.": "Julia",
  "We have no general conceptual thrust for the band, other than trying to make music that keeps our interest. When things are novel, they are probably things we have discovered by accident or investigation rather than by design.": "Steve",

  "One of the big failures for the big auto companies is that even the CEO and the top management often don't understand design and manufacturing. As a CEO, you have to make decisions; you need to have knowledge.": "Henrik",
  "I don't take on projects that are a hassle or when someone comes in and says, 'We really need this design,' and I'm like, 'OK, fine, I'll do it.' It really has to be something that I personally feel intrigued and excited about - any product, as long as I'm excited by it. It doesn't have to be a car.": "Henrik",
  "When I design a car, I want people to look at it and go, 'Wow, that's kind of interesting,' and do a second take.": "Henrik",
  "The aim of being a good designer is to have an influence. If you design furniture or lifestyle, you should influence the way people evolve globally. It's good to have an influence.": "Olivier",
  "With couture, you feel obligated to design something modern each season, but with Theyskens Theory, I don't question anything. I'm thinking of what I'd like to wear.": "Olivier",

  "When I'm doing kitchen planning as well as bathroom design, I try to walk through the day with the homeowner. If we're talking about a kitchen, it will be: So, we are walking in with the groceries. When we are taking them out of the car, where will they go? What is the distance to fridge, to pantry?": "Candice",
  "Sometimes living in a room that's badly designed isn't the worst thing in the world. Trust me - this is a fact! Living in a room that has no design whatsoever is even worse. I've learned this from my many clients over the years that have moved into new houses and just can't figure out where to begin.": "Candice",

They were looking for an actor for 'Take a Giant Step,' and a producer liked my look and asked if I could act. I said, 'Yep!' Then I got into acting more or less just to make money for paints and canvases.": "Billy",
  "If you were the first person ever to design an application for the iPhone and you patented it, you would be very, very better off than we are right now, you know? But you've got to be the first one to do it. So I figured that Led Zeppelin or the Stones were going to do it unless we just got on to it. So I got cracking with the guys from Apple.": "Dhani",

  "You can get the best locksmith in the world to design the best lock he can design, is it pick proof? No, it's not: it can be very hard to pick, but it is pickable.

  "Brizo has been my single biggest sponsor since I began as a designer. Brizo wanted to be involved in many different areas of design - they had already worked with several architects, and fashion was an area they were interested in moving into.": "Jason",

  "Spare functional furniture, in my opinion, is the genius of 20th-century design.": "Luca",
  "It was the corner sweet-shop in Australia that first piqued my interest in interior design. I went into this space with a mixture of apprehension and excitement as a child. It was filled, floor to ceiling, with the most incredible rounded glass bowls filled to the brim with bonbons, buttons, and sweets.": "Anouska",

  "I'm a perfectionist. And that's served me very well in my career. It allows me to handle these large, complex problems without letting things fall through the cracks...

  "It was always my goal to 'up the ante' on good design, and I've devoted much of my career to this.": "Michael",
  "When I started my own practice, I was criticized, not because I was doing product design but because, like Le Corbusier, I was insisting on paintings in all of my buildings. I would paint wall murals in the houses that I designed, just as he did in the '20s and '30s.": "Michael",
  "When I design a building, I'm making sure you and I can get to the front door, there's enough of a threshold for entry, and that the rooms are in a logical sequence.": "Michael",
  "The cost is minimal, but one of the things that you want in a universal design is to make the plan as open as you can... and to still have walls around bedrooms and that sort of thing, and to keep the corridors wide enough so the wheelchair can do a 360 in the corridor.": "Michael",
  "Good design should be available to everyone - and I do mean everyone. What I spent on the wheelchair I'm in could buy a small Mercedes. It's not only unfair to me it's unfair to someone who's indigent but has the same needs. My goal is to make all objects affordable. ": "Michael",

  "People nowadays think of gamebooks as rather old hat - and, after all, it was twenty years ago. In their heyday, though, they were a phenomenon, selling upwards of a hundred thousand units per title. And it's not as old hat as you might think: the same design skills I used in those days apply equally when I'm creating modern videogames.": "Dave",

  "Uniqlo as a company has always developed new fabrics and is always trying to be innovative. The design is simple, so the fabric is important.": "Nicola",

  "Readers always seem to think that the author has some control over the design of their books.": "Donald",

  "Hip-hop and electronic music are so similar, in the fact that they're both very visceral, have so much bass; a lot of times, it's the same tempos. The culture and some of the sound design is different but a lot of times, it's the same stuff.": "Skrillex",
  "If you're talking to an architect, he can look at a blank piece of paper, and once the initial design is there, the formula kicks in.

  "I design for the working girl.": "Elsa",
  "So, to really execute design in its highest form and making people feel joy, that's a great reward.": "Genevieve",

  "A good designer must rely on experience, on precise, logic thinking; and on pedantic exactness. No magic will do.": "Niklaus",
  "I do what I love to do at the moment. If I wake up tomorrow and decide I want to dance, that's what I'd do. Or design clothes. I think I'd throw myself into whatever I'm doing now.

  "Flying through a hurricane is the most fearsome shaking you will ever get. Everything has to be tied down in the airplane. And the IMAX camera has to be rock-steady through all this. We had to design special mounts on the left and right sides of the cabin and in the cockpit to hold the cameras.": "Greg",
  "I've learned a lot about stage-managing for illustration. Sometimes you have to delete characters from a scene just to keep from overcrowding the image. I've also learned to making big-scale design decisions early.": "Scott",
  "I wouldn't say design has become strictly functional. A lot of cars these days look downright comic book to me, and the info-gadgets with which late industrial people spend the most time - phones, music players, etc. - are blobjects.": "Scott",
  "With everything that I design, from a church to a plate to skyscraper to a spoon. I am always thinking about voluptuous volumes and spaces.": "Greg",
  "Of course, I did lots of what would be called graphic design now, what used to be called commercial art.": "Leonard",
  "The design process usually starts as a fantasy, with ideas that I dream of and visualize. These ideas become a reality by bringing various ingredients together, from the lifestyle of my bride, her age and sex appeal, to the textures of the finest fabrics and embroideries that we produce in my family factories in India.": "Naeem",
  "I could design an $800 shoe line it's easy. You use the best materials and you can make beautiful shoes. It's easier than making great shoes for $90. ": "Steve",

  "Good design doesn't date.": "Harry",
  "Design is an unknown.": "Geoffrey",
  "I have made bouquets of pleats, bouquets of flowers, bouquets of ruffles, bouquets of feathers. Often I design in mousseline, held tightly around the waist, and with something else going on all around.": "Giambattista",
  "My architectural drive was to design new types of buildings to help poor people, especially following natural disasters and catastrophes... I will use whatever time is left to me to keep doing what I have been doing, which is to help humanity.": "Frei",
  "I decided to design and build my own stereo amplifier system at age 13.": "Jim",
  "Information design has been around since the 1970s. Pioneers like Yale University design guru Edward Tufte and design agency Pentagram have long known and used its power. But now with the rise of the Internet, it's having something of a second birth.": "David",
  "Nothing they design ever gets in the way of a work of art.": "Robert",
  "I got into university to study graphic design, and I got into drama school as well, so I had the choice whether I wanted to go down the sensible route or if I wanted to become an actor.": "Chris",
  "My dad wanted me to be a professional person, which I was - I was a civil engineer. I graduated from civil engineering at USC in California. I became an engineer, and I helped design the roads for the L.A. County Roads Department. And I did that for about one and a half years in a sense to please my parents - to be a 'respectable' person.": "James",
  "Great designers seldom make great advertising men, because they get overcome by the beauty of the picture - and forget that merchandise must be sold.": "James",

  "Happy is the man who finds a true friend, and far happier is he who finds that true friend in his wife.": "Franz",
  "The real act of marriage takes place in the heart, not in the ballroom or church or synagogue. It's a choice you make - not just on your wedding day, but over and over again - and that choice is reflected in the way you treat your husband or wife.": "Barbara",
  "When a man opens a car door for his wife, it's either a new car or a new wife.": "Prince",

  "May this marriage be full of laughter, our every day in paradise.": "Rumi",
  "Marriage is neither heaven nor hell, it is simply purgatory.": "Abraham",
  "I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. I am not in favor of gay marriage. But when you start playing around with constitutions, just to prohibit somebody who cares about another person, it just seems to me that's not what America's about. Usually, our constitutions expand liberties, they don't contract them.": "Barack",

  "My wife is my soul mate. I can't imagine being without her.": "Matt",
  "Political promises are much like marriage vows. They are made at the beginning of the relationship between candidate and voter, but are quickly forgotten.": "Dick",
  "In my mind, marriage is a spiritual partnership and union in which we willingly give and receive love, create and share intimacy, and open ourselves to be available and accessible to another human being in order to heal, learn and grow.": "Iyanla",

  "A wedding is a funeral where you smell your own flowers.": "Eddie",
  "A marriage doesn't have to be perfect, but you can be perfect for each other.": "Jessica",
  "Rituals, anthropologists will tell us, are about transformation. The rituals we use for marriage, baptism or inaugurating a president are as elaborate as they are because we associate the ritual with a major life passage, the crossing of a critical threshold, or in other words, with transformation.": "Abraham",
  "So many people prefer to live in drama because it's comfortable. It's like someone staying in a bad marriage or relationship - it's actually easier to stay because they know what to expect every day, versus leaving and not knowing what to expect.": "Ellen",
  "The argument that gay marriage doesn't affect straight marriages is a ridiculous red herring: Gay marriage affects society and law in dramatic ways. Religious groups will come under direct assault as federal and state governments move to strip them of their non-profit statuses if they refuse to perform gay marriages.": "Ben",
  "In a happy marriage it is the wife who provides the climate, the husband the landscape.": "Gerald",
  "Sensual pleasures have the fleeting brilliance of a comet a happy marriage has the tranquillity of a lovely sunset. ": "Ann",

  "In marriage there are no manners to keep up, and beneath the wildest accusations no real criticism. Each is familiar with that ancient child in the other who may erupt again. We are not ridiculous to ourselves. We are ageless. That is the luxury of the wedding ring.": "Enid",

  "Those who condemn gay marriage, yet are silent or indifferent to the breakdown of marriage and divorce, are, in my view, missing the real issue.": "Malcolm",

  "Marriage is like a game of chess except the board is flowing water, the pieces are made of smoke and no move you make will have any effect on the outcome.": "Jerry",
  "Marriage is a school itself. Also, having children. Becoming a father changed my whole life. It taught me as if by revelation.": "Abraham",
  "You're not just going out there, maybe sacrificing your own life. There's also sacrifices still going on at home. You can serve in the military and have a good marriage, but you just need to be aware of it so you can take those steps to take care of it.": "Chris",
  "A good businessman never makes a contract unless he's sure he can carry it through, yet every fool on earth is perfectly willing to sign a marriage contract without considering whether he can live up to it or not.": "Dalton",

  "Wit is the sudden marriage of ideas which, before their union, were not perceived to have any relation.": "Mark",
  "They say marriage will change you but it didn't change me. Being in love changed me.": "R.",
  "The mark of a good marriage is partnership and continuing to feel inspired by your spouse. I had that with Tao. But the end is not necessarily the tragedy. Staying in a relationship that is no longer working is the tragedy. Living unhappily - that's the tragedy.": "Olivia",
  "You can't have a happy family if you don't have a happy marriage.": "Jeremy",
  "The great marriages are partnerships. It can't be a great marriage without being a partnership.": "Helen",
  "I have a very happy marriage and friends who keep my feet on the ground. But looking for satisfaction in life is difficult. Maybe being happy is as simple as not being unhappy.": "Jasper",
  "My views are very fluctuating. I have very contradictory takes on the subject. Dating is easier, while marriage is hard work. You see your friends having early divorces, and on the other hand, you see your parents having a successful marriage.": "Kangana",
  "I would love to have the same rights as everybody else. I would love, I don't care if it's called marriage. I don't care if it's called, you know, domestic partnership. I don't care what it's called.": "Ellen",
  "The Left despises Texas, with its stellar record of job growth; Texas, with its strong support for traditional marriage and the sanctity of life; Texas, the root of the conservative tree. Should the Left succeed in its attempt to turn Texas purple, America could turn permanently blue.": "Ben",
  "People used to say my son looked like a Mexican Biggie. And when he was first born, memories of Biggie... you know, we didn't always have the greatest days. For at least half the length of our marriage we were separated, so everyday was definitely not a good day.": "Faith",
  "I think men are mainly unfaithful because as they get older, they feel the urge to prove to themselves that they are still attractive. They need proof from outside the marriage. It's really sad. It's all about them. It's not about their wives at all.": "Pattie",
  "For it is mutual trust, even more than mutual interest that holds human associations together. Our friends seldom profit us but they make us feel safe. Marriage is a scheme to accomplish exactly that same end.": "H.",
  "A marriage is no amusement but a solemn act, and generally a sad one.": "Queen",
  "The most important thing for a good marriage is to learn how to argue peaceably.": "Anita",
  "You can't wake up one day and say 'I'm for gay marriage,' and wake up the next day and say 'I'm against it.' Wake up one day and say, 'I'm pro-choice,' and the next day wake up and say, 'I'm pro-life.' There's no credibility there.": "Roger",

  "It's tough to stay married. My wife kisses the dog on the lips, yet she won't drink from my glass.": "Rodney",
  "Marriage resembles a pair of shears, so joined that they cannot be separated; often moving in opposite directions, yet always punishing anyone who comes between them.": "Sydney",

  "Husbands are like fires - they go out when they're left unattended.": "Cher",
  "Marriage should be a duet - when one sings, the other claps.": "Joe",
  "But marriage goes in waves. You've got to be patient. People bail and give up on their marriages way too early. They just don't put the work and the effort into it. You've got to suck up your ego a lot of times, because that can be a big downfall.": "Anna",
  "Marriage: a ceremony in which rings are put on the finger of the lady and through the nose of the gentleman.": "Herbert",
  "I know one husband and wife who, whatever the official reasons given to the court for the break up of their marriage, were really divorced because the husband believed that nobody ought to read while he was talking and the wife that nobody ought to talk while she was reading.": "Vera",
  "Marriage is miserable unless you find the right person that is your soulmate and that takes a lot of looking.": "Marvin",
  "In the spring of 1936, I was introduced by friends to Jean Tatlock. In the autumn, I began to court her. We were at least twice close enough to marriage to think of ourselves as engaged.": "J.",
  "What I believe is that marriage is between a man and a woman, but what I also believe is that we have an obligation to make sure that gays and lesbians have the rights of citizenship that afford them visitations to hospitals, that allow them to be, to transfer property between partners, to make certain that they're not discriminated on the job.": "Barack",
  "Let us be honest with each other. The threat to marriage is not the gays. It is a lack of loving commitment - whether it is found in the form of neglect, indifference, cruelty or adultery, to name just a few manifestations of the loveless desert in which too many marriages come to grief.": "Malcolm",
  "When you look at statistics for the white community alone, you see that we've become two separate worlds in which the successful are educated and wait to have children until they are married, and those in poverty are primarily those without higher education and with children outside of marriage.": "Rand",
  "Almost no one is foolish enough to imagine that he automatically deserves great success in any field of activity yet almost everyone believes that he automatically deserves success in marriage. ": "Sydney",
  "More belongs to marriage than four legs in a bed.": "Rainer",
  "You know, my friends, with what a brave carouse I made a Second Marriage in my house; favored old barren reason from my bed, and took the daughter of the vine to spouse.": "Omar",
  "Marriage may often be a stormy lake, but celibacy is almost always a muddy horse pond.": "Thomas",
  "If your neighbor has a completely different view on abortion, gay marriage, stem cell research, all of those things, you still are both Americans. Neither one of you is necessarily more patriotic than the other. Neither loves their country any more than the other one does.": "Phil",
  "A wife lasts only for the length of the marriage, but an ex-wife is there for the rest of your life.": "Jim",
  "I don't think that a same-sex marriage is the way God intended it to be.": "Joel",
  "There was a time in the marriage when I could no longer look at myself in a mirror, couldn't feel I was a nice person. A bad relationship can do that, can make you doubt everything good you ever felt about yourself.": "Dionne",
  "Courtship is to marriage, as a very witty prologue to a very dull play.": "William",
  "It is better to be unhappy in love than unhappy in marriage, but some people manage to be both.": "Guy",
  "Marriage brings one into fatal connection with custom and tradition, and traditions and customs are like the wind and weather, altogether incalculable.": "Soren",
  "I'm not for gay marriage, but I'm not for discriminating against people.": "Joel",
  "Friendship is two-sided. It isn't a friend just because someone's doing something nice for you. That's a nice person. There's friendship when you do for each other. It's like marriage - it's two-sided.": "John",
  "Marriage is a reflection of your life in general: how you treat people, how you argue, how secure you are in your own thoughts. How vehemently do you argue your point of view? With what disdain do you view the other's point of view?": "William",
  "I thought the divorce statistics would never apply to me. I was beyond heartbroken when they did. But I got up and got on with it. I also kept my belief in marriage.": "Jennifer",
  "Particularly black Americans, many of them, from quotes that I have seen and conversations I've had, are sort of insulted that the civil rights movement is being hijacked - the rhetoric of the civil rights movement is being hijacked for something like same sex marriage. Black Americans tend to have a higher degree of religiosity.": "Gary",
  "The state's interest in marriage is stability. Generally speaking, polygamy does not work for stability. Inherent in the whole polygamous movement is a deep and abiding misogyny and denigration of women. So polygamy is objectionable on lots of grounds.": "Gene",
  "One hopes, of course, that a relationship grows and becomes a deep and wonderful marriage and friendship that lasts forever. But that's not always the case.": "Alana",
  "We do not create marriage from scratch. Instead, in the elegant language of the marriage ceremony, we 'enter into the holy estate of matrimony.'": "Nancy",
  "The Hindu marriage may be described as the union of two families. In this union, there is no room for petty ambitions and personal ego-trips. What is involved is love for the entire family that one is marrying into.": "Dada",
  "Marriage, as an institution, is as dead as the dodo bird.": "Joan",
  "I don't care how handsome or fabulous or funny the groom is, or how sweet and accommodating the bride, or vice versa. Marriage is hard.": "Jenna",
  "Ultimately, my greatest achievement is maintaining my career while sustaining a happy marriage and kids.": "Melina",
  "I'm in love with love and totally believe in marriage, but that's not even on my radar right now. I am not putting energy into dating.": "Selena",
  "My parents were, had a marriage of passion, and the passion was about their religious beliefs. They were both immigrant families that - well, my father's family came as Puritans to Massachusetts.": "Phil",
  "I would love to get married, first of all, from my children's perspective. People don't think of children when they think of gay marriage, but I do have children, and for them to see their family validated as other families are validated and protected by our government, yes.": "Judy",
  "People should be allowed to marry, and gay marriage should be out there. If a man or a woman has a good partner and they love each other with their heart and soul, let them marry. I am very much for gay marriage.": "Pierce",
  "The battle going on over gay marriage in America reveals an awful lot. The Bible belt - people hate gay people. Because the Bible tells them? No, the Bible tells them an awful lot of things that they ignore.": "Ian",
  "It is my conviction that marriage is such a good idea, only God could have thought of it.": "Myles",
  "I feel that heterosexual marriage is the more excellent way, and it surely is approved holy by the Holy Bible, and it holds so many more possibilities: the possibilities of having children of both the mother and father, the male and the female.": "Robert",
  "People today expect too much from marriage. Getting married is really like taking on a big new job.": "Rosamunde",
  "It is disgusting that 'Life & Style' and 'InTouch' magazines continue to print these false stories about my life: the status of my marriage, false reports about a miscarriage, the horrible lie that my dad is not my biological father, jealousy over my sisters' lives, etc.": "Khloe",
  "TV started for me just as a means of keeping my husband Desi off the road. He'd been on tour with his band since he got out of the Army, and we were in our 11th year of marriage and wanted to have children.": "Lucille",
  "I've found a letter that was written to me from a girl who was getting married. And she wanted to know the secret of a happy marriage. I said - and I wrote back and said something to the effect that I couldn't - I had no magic formula. And I never sat down and thought about it, but everything just fell into place with Ronnie and me.": "Nancy",
  "The United States is in a time of transition. Courts have redefined marriage, and beliefs about human sexuality are changing. Will the right to dissent be protected? Will the right of Americans to speak and act in accord with what the United States had always believed about marriage - that it's a union of husband and wife - be tolerated?": "Edwin",
  "Judaism doesn't recognize gay marriage, just as we don't recognize milk and meat together as kosher, and nothing will change it... I'm not a hypocrite; I state my positions.": "Naftali",
  "Marriage is survived just on the basis of ordinary etiquette, day in and day out. Also cooking together helps a lot... I've seen all these marriages that failed. Those people are always hollering at each other. That doesn't work.": "Jim",
  "Anyone who watched George W. and Karl Rove while the former was governor of Texas will recognize a familiar pattern. Like much of Bush's social policy - from faith-based social services to railing against gay marriage - women's issues are one of the bones they've decided they can throw to the Christian right.": "Molly",
  "Long-term relationships are an everyday choice. It's harder to be in a marriage than it is to bounce from one relationship to the next.": "Pink",
  "Well, my wife and I were married in a toilet - it was a marriage of convenience!": "Tommy",
  "Marriage is like twirling a baton, turning hand springs or eating with chopsticks. It looks easy until you try it.": "Helen",
  "Feminism is dated? Yes, for privileged women like my daughter and all of us here today, but not for most of our sisters in the rest of the world who are still forced into premature marriage, prostitution, forced labor - they have children that they don't want or they cannot feed.": "Isabel",
  "I think that every state in the union should recognize same-sex marriage.": "Cass",
  "I have not supported same-sex marriage. I have supported civil partnerships and contractual relationships.": "Hillary",

  "My grandmother was energetic and fearless - a talented poet and songwriter. She was also interested in chemistry and history and medicine, taking care of the people in her hacienda in Mexico, delivering babies. She could have become anything, but this was the 1930s, and she was forced into an arranged marriage.": "Salma",
  "I do believe in soulmates and happy/successful marriages. No marriage can be happy 24x7 for 365 days. Both partners have to make the relationship work, is what I believe in.": "Kajol",
  "The rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And, quite frankly, we're winning many, many victories. On the social conservative side, we're the voice of the anti-abortion movement, the voice of the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we're winning victory after victory after victory.": "Stephen",

  "I think even in a good marriage, especially if you stay together long enough, there are going to be events that happen.": "Tori",

  "What I've learnt being an actor is that you've got to be lucky. I got less lucky, and nobody was interested. If a part came up, it would be for the main corpse's friend's brother who was having problems with his marriage.": "Peter",
  "Marriage is a mystery, and part of it is just being kind to each other, not being selfish.": "Aisha",
  "We make no greater voluntary choice in this life than the selection of a marriage partner. This decision can bring eternal happiness and joy. To find sublime fulfillment in marriage, both partners need to be fully committed to the marriage.": "James",
  "After a while in marriage, it doesn't work anymore. There is something missing, there is something wrong. There are few marriages that stay alive forever. We like something, and after a while, we hate what we used to love.": "Monica",
  "If bigots oppose gay marriage so vehemently, it must be because marriage is a defining institution for them; gays will never be fully accepted until they can marry and adopt, like anyone else.": "Edmund",
  "I had a friend who, after 25 years of marriage, found himself trying to date again, and it was completely different. Everything had changed, and he had to reacquaint himself. It was funny even talking to him about it. For someone who has been out of the loop, it's a different world.": "Steve",
  "Marriage counselors in particular all strongly recommend divorcees try to understand their role in a divorce before re-marrying. Statistics show if you re-marry before you've clearly seen things from the biter's point of view - you're re-bounded to fail again!": "Karen",

  "Like any friendship or marriage, familiarity breeds more contempt, and love, and everything.": "Martin",
  "I do not think that marriage is one of my talents. I've been much happier unmarried than married.": "Doris",
  "When you don't have access to a subject, and all you have is ex-members and critics, there is this gravitational pull toward telling a certain version of events. Scientology would say this, and they have a point, that it's like doing a portrait of a marriage in which you're only hearing from the ex-wife and not the ex-husband.": "Louis",
  "When the first fossils began to be found in eastern Africa, in the late 1950s, I thought, what a wonderful marriage this was, biology and anthropology. I was around 16 years old when I made this particular choice of academic pursuit.": "Donald",
  "Marriage is not just spiritual communion, it is also remembering to take out the trash.": "Joyce",
  "Families are not merely constructs of outdated convention, and traditional marriage laws were not based on animosity toward homosexuals. Rather, I believe that the traditional family structure - centered on a lawful union between one man and one woman - comports with nature and with our Judeo-Christian moral tradition.": "Charles",
  "A good marriage is different to a happy marriage.": "Debra",
  "For someone to say that marriage is only about procreation is a joke. I didn't marry my husband to have children. I married my husband because I love my husband.": "Aisha",
  "A lasting marriage, they say, is one where the two reach for different sections of the Sunday paper. Me, I go right for the obituaries, just like those very elderly characters in Muriel Spark's spooky novel, 'Memento Mori.'": "Billy",

  "Marriage must incessantly contend with a monster that devours everything: familiarity.": "Honore",
  "In almost every marriage there is a selfish and an unselfish partner. A pattern is set up and soon becomes inflexible, of one person always making the demands and one person always giving way.": "Iris",
  "Never stay in a bad marriage, and don't hang around with psycho coke fiends.": "Joe",
  "Marriage does figure in my life, as I do want to have children. But I could also consider having children without getting married. The primary thing is having a good father, a partner who could be there with me through that journey.": "Jacqueline",
  "My first wife was a brunette, and Barbi Benton, my major romantic relationship of the early 1970s, was a brunette. But since the end of my marriage, all of my girlfriends have been blonds.": "Hugh",
  "The heart of marriage is memories; and if the two of you happen to have the same ones and can savor your reruns, then your marriage is a gift from the gods.": "Bill",
  "I was very influenced by the musicals and romantic comedies of the 1930s. I admired Gene Harlow and such, which probably explains why, since the end of my marriage, I've dated nothing but a succession of blondes.": "Hugh",
  "The priesthood is a marriage. People often start by falling in love, and they go on for years without realizing that love must change into some other love which is so unlike it that it can hardly be recognized as love at all.": "Iris",

  "My thoughts on gay marriage are that everyone has the right to love and be loved, and that's the position I take.": "Nick",
  "Children are supposed to help hold a marriage together. They do this in a number of ways. For instance, they demand so much attention that a husband and wife, concentrating on their children, fail to notice each other's faults.": "Richard",
  "Before marriage, a man declares that he would lay down his life to serve you; after marriage, he won't even lay down his newspaper to talk to you.": "Helen",
  "Religious institutions should have religious freedom on this issue. No church or minister should ever have to conduct a marriage that is inconsistent with their religious beliefs. But I think as a civil institution, this issue's time has come and we need to move forward.": "Kay",
  "There is a difference between civil partnerships and marriage. That difference does not mean one is better than another.": "John",
  "Early on in my life, I had a broken soul. I was abused by my father, abandoned by my mother and ended up in a destructive first marriage. By the time I was 23, I was broken in my soul. I didn't know how to think right. I felt wrong about everything. But God stepped into my life, and I came out on the other side and didn't even smell like smoke.": "Joyce",
  "I was totally surprised by the spread of the legalization of same-sex marriage. In just my lifetime we have gone from a taboo to even talk about homosexuality, to the sanction by governments of homosexual marriage. Few such large social considerations have ever before been turned over in such a short time.": "John",
  "I'm 58 years old. I got married for the first time - it's about time, right? Growing up as a gay woman, you just don't ever think about that, and then I thought, about 10 years ago, 'You know, I think within 10 years gay marriage will be legal.' And here we are, 10 years later, making it legal.": "Martina",
  "I don't really care how or why Obama got to the right place on gay marriage. I'm just glad he got there.": "Mark",

  "I put my career in second place throughout both my marriages and it suffered. I don't regret it. You make choices. If you want a good marriage, you must pay attention to that. If you want to be independent, go ahead. You can't have it all.": "Lauren",

  "Marriage is a gamble, let's be honest.": "Yoko",

  "Sticking with a marriage. That's true grit, man.": "Jeff",
  "I've exchanged messages and photos of an explicit nature with about six women over the last three years. For the most part, these communications took place before my marriage, though some have sadly took place after. To be clear, I have never met any of these women or had physical relationships at any time.": "Anthony",
  "Marriage is all about knowing the ins and outs and the intimate details, and your wife is supposed to be the person you know best. But my brother and I think alike, know everything about one another, and when we get together, we block everything else out. Nothing exists in our world except for us.": "Jon",
  "To be honest, marriage doesn't scare me and that, it's just once you've been together for so long, if you haven't got any kids it's just a big expensive day out for everyone else to enjoy, isn't it?": "Karl",
  "Straight couples don't have to be monogamous to be married or married to be monogamous. Monogamy no more defines marriage than the presence of children does. Monogamy isn't compulsory and its absence doesn't invalidate a marriage.": "Dan",

  "You can't know about marriage until you try it.": "Greg",
  "The only day I remember of my parents' marriage was the day my dad walked out. As I stood there at five years old, with my older sister and younger brother, I knew that he was gone.": "Ellie",
  "Brands mature over time, like a marriage. The bond you feel with your spouse is different than when you first met each other. Excitement and discovery are replaced by comfort and depth.": "Gary",

  "I met my wife in Bombay at an official function. And then we courted for three years. That's a great old term, 'courting.' And we had to do it quietly, of course, because you would know the difficulties one might have with Indian parents. She was advised by her father that people in the West don't take marriage seriously.": "Glenn",
  "I had 53 years of happy marriage and two daughters. These were the best things that happened in my life.": "Henry",
  "Here's why I cannot vote for Rudy Giuliani. He's pro-abortion. He's never repudiated gay marriage in New York City or at least the civil unions in New York City. He's called a champion of gay rights. Rudy is opposed to school choice. He's in favor of open borders.": "James",

  "Marriage is the most obvious public practice about which information is readily available. When combined with the traditional Jewish concern for continuity and self-preservation - itself only intensified by the memory of the Holocaust - marriage becomes the sine qua non of social membership in the modern Orthodox community.": "Noah",
  "There is no clear place to draw the line once you eliminate the traditional marriage, and it's the same once you start putting limits on what guns can be used, then it's just really easy to have laws that make them all illegal.": "Louie",
  "Society may no longer define marriage in the only way marriage has ever been defined in the annals of recorded history. Many societies allowed polygamy, many allowed child marriages, some allowed marriage within families; but none, in thousands of years, defined marriage as the union of people of the same sex.": "Dennis",
  "I don't want to make any judgments, and I don't want to preach, but I'm hoping that marriage can work: that when people do fall in love, when people do find their soul mate, everyone sticks to it. It has the potential to be a very powerful thing, marriage.": "Jonathan",
  "A band is like a marriage, and if you're in a marriage with someone, and you lose yourself in that marriage, the relationship is over, really.": "Richie",
  "Being in a successful marriage is no different than being cast in a successful movie. It's all about who you pick; in that first moment, did you pick the right person? I think you need to pick somebody who's more interested in being married than in getting married.": "Rob",
  "My mother and father met at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. He was a senior and she was a junior, and their marriage didn't last very long.": "Michael",
  "My feelings on homosexuality are unequivocal. I have absolutely no problem with it whatsoever. My only reservation is marriage.": "Carl",
  "After my second marriage failed... I said, 'You know, could I have a relationship with a man? A loving relationship with a man that would involve intimacy?' For a while, before I did get into a relationship, I saw, for a few years, either women or men. And I found that I could be attracted to both.": "Clive",
  "Just because marriage didn't work for us doesn't mean we don't believe in the institution. Just because our own marital track records are mixed doesn't mean our hearts don't lift at the sight of our daughters' Tiffany-blue wedding invitations.": "Sandra",
  "My parents divorced when I was 3 years old. They had a lounge act in Las Vegas, where I was born. The band broke up and the marriage dissolved, and my mother, my sister and I moved to Southern California. And I didn't see my dad a lot growing up; he was on the road a lot. I'd see him every couple years.": "Jenny",
  "We need leaders who will stand unapologetically in defense of marriage.": "Ted",
  "Marriage is about love, but it is not first and foremost about love. First and foremost, marriage is about continuity and transmission.": "Meir",

  "Romantic love came under attack, first from the Freudians and then from the neuroscientists, who said that being in love was a chemical reaction in the brain. Marriage is no longer seen as a lifetime commitment.": "Jane",
  "The social relations which are the basis of the reproduction of the species are founded upon the continuous union of parents in marriage.": "Maria",
  "I have always maintained a strong opposition to marriage because I would have to be in serious denial to pretend I wasn't born with a personality for divorce. Whatever the opposite of amicable is, that's how my breakups tend to play out.": "Chelsea",
  "We didn't know that Mother had gone through a passionate love affair or that Father suffered from severe depression. Mother was preparing to break out of her marriage, Father threatening to take his own life.": "Ingmar",
  "Marriage, to women as to men, must be a luxury, not a necessity; an incident of life, not all of it.": "Susan",
  "There are lots of different ideas, lots of different opinions about the First Amendment Defense Act and what it should be. There were a lot of different forms of it while I was on the Hill. But I would say that I agree that the decision on gay marriage does mean that we need to take some steps to defend religious liberty.": "Evan",
  "Marriage is tough. I can tell my wife all day long that I love her, but it doesn't mean anything if you don't show that.": "Jeff",
  "My music is about where I am at the time. In 'Raymond vs. Raymond,' I was going through a lot of things, and it came out in my music. My marriage fell apart, and I was suddenly a single father.": "Usher",
  "My advice to Robin is listen to your heart, do what you feel. Follow your heart in love and marriage as you would in careers, and you'll be fine. Robin has a great heart. He's a fabulous father.": "Alan",
  "She has been more than a mother than me - not much, but definitely more... She's been an unsolicited stylist, interior decorator and marriage counselor... Admittedly, I found it difficult to share my mother with her adoring fans, who treated her like she was part of their family.": "Carrie",
  "I don't regret any decision in my life... not my career, not marriage. Every experience has been so fulfilling in so many ways.": "Amrita",
  "Marriage is scary to me, man.": "The",
  "I'm certain that most couples expect to find intimacy in marriage, but it somehow eludes them.": "James",
  "I think there was a time in my life, probably in college, that I wished every guy was gay because it meant more women for me! I don't know what everyone's problem with it is. I wish everyone was gay! That's always the way I thought about it. I have no issue with it. If I have to suffer through marriage, why shouldn't they?": "Donald",
  "I had a happy marriage and a nice wife. I accomplished everything you can. What more can you want?": "Max",
  "Spiritually, we have marginalized the Bible. We've trivialized marriage, and we've neutralized the church. America today is in great turmoil. It feels like the soul of our nation has been taken from us.": "David",
  "To enter upon the marriage union is one of the most deeply important events of life. It cannot be too prayerfully treated. Our happiness, our usefulness, our living for God or for ourselves afterwards, are often most intimately connected with our choice. Therefore, in the most prayerful manner, this choice should be made.": "George",
  "We're used to boy meets girl, boy likes girl, instant attraction on TV. But you throw a son in there, you throw a marriage in there, and you've got some really good character stuff.": "Matt",
  "Earlier, my priority was only work. I worked like a dog before I got married. After marriage, once you have a baby, time management is difficult. Your responsibilities change, your priorities change. And you have to concentrate on them if you have to work out your life. Your career is just a part of your life. For me, my family is my life.": "Kajol",
  "What sort of job can you hold in America in which it is safe to hold the personal conviction that same-sex marriage is wrong? The answer: there is no such job. Except Democratic presidential candidate in 2008. Then you're fine.": "Ben",
  "Mainstream American society finds it easiest to be tolerant when the outsider chooses to minimize the differences that separate him from the majority. The country club opens its doors to Jews.

  "The one charm about marriage is that it makes a life of deception absolutely necessary for both parties.": "Oscar",

  "Supporting the definition of marriage as one man and one woman is not anti-gay: it is pro-traditional marriage. And if support for traditional marriage is bigotry, then Barack Obama was a bigot until just before the 2012 election.": "Marco",

  "One of the things, one of the things that really got to me was the thing in Houston where you had the government, the mayor actually, trying to get the sermons of ministers.

  "TV does a thing that film can never do. It takes you to a place that no novel written after the late 19th century can. You can just go through people's lives it's like a marriage. ": "Joss",
  "It's only fair that stable gay relationships of long standing should have the same rights and responsibilities as married couples. I know the image of gay marriage is to some people horrific and ludicrous.": "Ian",

  "I didn't want to be one of those women who wake up at 63 years old and realize they've missed the window of opportunity for marriage and children.": "Alanis",
  "I was so ready to become a mom. Actually, I was ready secondarily to become a mom. I was so ready to have the intimacy and commitment of marriage.": "Alanis",
  "I come from divorce. I'm only doing marriage once. It's not a game for me.": "Shia",
  "Marriage is distinctly and repeatedly excluded from heaven. Is this because it is thought likely to mar the general felicity?": "Samuel",
  "A man's friendships are, like his will, invalidated by marriage - but they are also no less invalidated by the marriage of his friends.": "Samuel",
  "It's volatile, the marriage. Which one isn't? Nothing better than a good, full-on row. Get it all out. Say rude and nasty things. And then be sorry. Genuinely sorry, afterwards.": "John",
  "In our ecclesiastical region there are priests who don't baptize the children of single mothers because they weren't conceived in the sanctity of marriage. These are today's hypocrites. Those who clericalize the church. Those who separate the people of God from salvation.": "Pope",
  "We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion, gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods. The teaching of the church is clear, and I am a son of the church, but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time.": "Pope",
  "Sometimes I bust out and do things so permanent. Like tattoos and marriage.": "Drew",
  "I've never understood why we would want to deny all the joys - and the challenges - of marriage to anyone. Which is why I think any loving, committed couple - gay or straight - should be able to get married.": "Al",
  "Marriage is becoming sort of fake. It's almost like a handbag. Everybody wants the newest, greatest and latest. It becomes an event, and it's definitely a status symbol in our society. I'm not saying it shouldn't be; it absolutely should be - but you shouldn't be focusing on that.": "Rob",
  "When my mother had four girls, and she could tell her marriage was falling apart, she went back to college and got her degree in music and education.": "Andie",
  "For me, it's sad to say, but I would probably have a spiritual marriage but not a legal marriage, because I think so much about marriage starts to become about finances. It has nothing to do with God or feelings or the romantic side of marriage. It's about who owns what, who gets what? So what's the point?": "Andie",

  "A key to keeping your husband is getting him to miss you. That keeps a marriage fresh.": "Tori",

  "When you genuinely feel like that was the right relationship, you're supposed to give it all you can. That's what marriage is about.": "Khloe",
  "With my divorce, and even during the end of my marriage before it even got publicly bad, how I decided to cope with things was to go on the treadmill for an hour.": "Khloe",
  "Why is marriage the pinnacle for everyone? People get married for the wrong reasons. We need to start looking at different packages, whether it's living together, or being with six partners, or dedicating your life to taking care of flowers.": "Sandra",
  "When you're old-fashioned like I am, you know marriage is forever. Those vows are a promise.": "Brad",
  "There may be people in my audience who may not agree with me on some particular issue - you know, say, as a gun owner, they may not agree with me, or, you know, someone may not agree with me on a gay marriage topic. Any of those things. But those shouldn't be the reasons you listen to my music.": "Brad",
  "Marriage brings up all the things I pushed to the back burner - the fears, the mistrust, the doubts, the insecurities. It's like opening Pandora's box.": "Jennifer",

  "You will often be in despair. You will sometimes think it's the worst decision in your life. That's fine. That's not a sign your marriage has gone wrong. It's a sign that it's normal it's on track. And many of the hopes that took you into the marriage will have to die in order for the marriage to continue. ": "Alain",
  "What is fascinating about marriage is why anyone wants to get married.": "Alain",
  "The romantic person instinctively sees marriage in terms of emotions, but what a couple actually gets up to together over a lifetime has much more in common with the workings of a small business. They must draw up work rosters, clean, chauffeur, cook, fix, throw away, mind, hire, fire, reconcile, and budget.": "Alain",

  "I think the government should be out of the marriage business and leave marriage to the churches.": "Gary",

  "Despite the myth that men are less committed, they are predisposed to desire marriage.": "Helen",
  "My life, in some ways, has been a half-measure. I didn't commit myself all the way to my marriage and family, because I would have given up more. And I didn't go all the way with just being completely selfish. I always wonder where my career would be if I was more selfish.": "Alec",
  "I had a marriage that I came to in the same way everybody else comes to a marriage. We all take chances when we get married.": "Alec",
  "As my friend said to me, when you have children, typically in a second marriage, when you're older and you get married again to a woman who would have children, you must always remember that you make sure the children attend a college where the commencement ceremonies are held in a facility with a wheelchair accessible ramp.": "Alec",
  "Men are literally lying in bed with their wives when the marriage is essentially over, thinking, 'I've got to get the hell out of here', and have a fantasy woman in mind. Then you get divorced, meet a woman, marry her, and by the time all that goes by, you've aged a few years and are ready to go back to your ex-wife.": "Alec",
  "I like marriage. I feel very secure. It helps when you are in love with the person you are married to.": "Claire",

  "I support gay marriage. I support gay marriage because I believe Conservatives support the institutions of commitment.": "George",
  "I have an American son and an American partner, so marriage might logistically make sense at one point. My partner is a stay-at-home father, so if he wants to be on my health plan, or tax wise, or maybe on paper we want to have our I's dotted and our T's crossed, but emotionally, neither of us really feels the need for it.": "Evangeline",

  "Our Nation must defend the sanctity of marriage.": "George",
  "You know, Republicans should have a consistent philosophy. And if your philosophy is about limited government and not intruding in people's lives, you shouldn't just inconveniently take a social issue like gay marriage and say, 'Well, unless we think - actually we should be intruding your life.'": "Mark",
  "Politics only makes the difficult challenge of marriage even harder, with the demands of the job and the public spotlight it casts on a union.": "Mark",
  "It's nice to know you have support. Last night I got a marriage proposal. I just laughed.": "Carrie",
  "Marriage is hard. I'm not gonna lie.": "Aisha",
  "Marriage is a blood sport. Marriage is jousting. It's disembowelment. It's just terrible, terrible visceral injuries. It's not for everybody.": "Aisha",
  "I married my husband because I loved him, and I don't feel like there's anybody missing from our marriage, but when you think about this person that you love, and you think about what a wonderful thing it would be to bring another person like that into this world, I think that's the hardest part about all of it.": "Aisha",
  "I believe that the essence of marriage is choosing someone who loves you for who you are, embraces everything about you, and building a life with that person. Whether that life is with children or without children - it's honestly immaterial to building a life with someone that you love fully.": "Aisha",
  "We must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living. On the other hand, to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage, in reality, does not help these people.": "Pope",
  "Above all, we must have great respect for these people who also suffer and who want to find their own way of correct living. On the other hand, to create a legal form of a kind of homosexual marriage, in reality, does not help these people.": "Pope",
  "It is essential that God created men and women to be one, as it is said in the first chapters of the Bible. So I think even if our culture is against marriage as essential form of relations between human beings, between women and men. I think our nature is always present, and we can understand it if we will understand it.": "Pope",

  "A sap run is the sweet goodbye of winter. It is the fruit of the equal marriage of the sun and frost.": "John",
  "Academia is very flexible, but I had a spouse who was very committed to being a completely full partner in our marriage. I think if you counted up how many hours each one of us logged in, he certainly gets more than 50%.": "Janet",
  "I think marriage is a scary concept. It's a scary concept for anybody. I'm not sure where I sit with that.": "Hozier",
  "Either somebody has equal rights, or they don't. And certainly in the Irish constitution, marriage is genderless. There's no mention of a man and a woman.": "Hozier",
  "When someone comes up to me and says, 'Mary, you helped save my marriage', or, 'Mary, you helped me get out of this abusive relationship', I'm in it, really in their lives. And I'm so passionate about my feelings, but also about showing people the way through theirs.": "Mary",
  "I don't know why, but the older I get the more interested I get in my parents' marriage. And it's interesting to be married yourself, too, because there is an inevitable comparison.": "Jhumpa",
  "My parents had an arranged marriage, as did so many other people when I was growing up. My father came and had a life in the United States one way and my mother had a different one, and I was very aware of those things. I continue to wonder about it, and I will continue to write about it.": "Jhumpa",
  "I got a few marriage proposals in my 20s. I just wasn't ready. I just knew if I committed, I would've wound up doing something wrong, messing it up. I still felt like I had some living to do.": "Queen",
  "Proponents of same-sex marriage regularly label opponents 'radical' and 'extremist.' However, given that no society in thousands of years has allowed same-sex marriage, it is, by definition, the proponents of same-sex marriage whose position is radical and extreme.": "Dennis",
  "By the time I had reached the age of 16, in the 10th grade, my parents, after 22 years of marriage, one day decided to get a divorce.": "Frank",
  "All I can think is that the owners of Chick-Fil-A have decided they have had enough, that they're just going to focus on selling chicken sandwiches to as many people as they can, and they figure that keeping their views about marriage to themselves is better than having a bunch of angry activists on your doorstep.": "Mike",

  "Now that virtually every career is an option for ambitious girls, it can no longer be considered regressive or reactionary to reintroduce discussion of marriage and motherhood to primary education. We certainly do not want to return to the simplistic duality of home economics classes for girls and wood shop for boys.": "Camille",
  "I didn't think marriage worked. I thought everybody who was married was secretly miserable - that it was something they just put up with for their children.": "Salma",

  "My thoughts are that marriage is between a man and a woman.": "Ben",
  "Marriage is a very sacred institution and should not be degraded by allowing every other type of relationship to be made equivalent to it.": "Ben",
  "Obama's endorsement of gay marriage is hardly as consequential as Johnson's legislative success on civil rights.": "Robert",
  "When Gingrich attacked CNN's John King for bringing up his alleged proposal of an open marriage to his second wife, Gingrich accused him of lowering the level of discourse in a presidential debate, suggesting that such a discussion is unworthy of consideration by voters.": "Robert",
  "Vice President Biden's surprising declaration of unqualified support for gay marriage seems to have forced President Obama into a public endorsement of a controversial social issue. It is difficult not to suspect that Biden's pronouncement aimed to give the president some political cover.": "Robert",
  "I have a terrific marriage, but unlike a lot of relationships where they ebb and flow, no matter what happens you fall deeper and deeper in love every day. It's kind of the best thing that can happen to you. It's thrilling.": "Hugh",
  "It's not someone else's responsibility to honor my marriage. It's my responsibility.": "David",
  "When you're a father in a marriage, you sort of become the mother's assistant. And you sort of get a list from her every day and you run down the list and it feels very much like a chore.": "Louis",
  "He's the kind of man a woman would have to marry to get rid of.": "Mae",
  "If I go into a relationship with an artist, which at most is going to last five years, we have a 100-page contract covering every eventuality. Whereas with marriage you go into it with no contract, with laws that date back hundreds of years, and I don't think that's right.": "Simon",
  "I couldn't think of anything worse than being in an unhappy marriage. It worries me because I've seen it destroy people.": "Simon",
  "It is a mistake for women to think that life begins only with marriage. A woman can and must have an identity and feel useful, valued, and needed whether she is single or married. She must feel that she can do something for someone else that no one else ever born can do.": "James",
  "Marriage is not easy. You have to decide to work. That's what it really comes down to: two people deciding to stay together or not.": "Darius",
  "I think one reason for a successful marriage is laughter. I think laughter gets you through the rough moments in a marriage.": "Bob",
  "If you look at Jack Benny, George Burns, or Don Rickles, they've all had long, successful marriages. So, I think there's something about laughter and the durability of a marriage.": "Bob",

  "Never get married in college it's hard to get a start if a prospective employer finds you've already made one mistake. ": "Elbert",
  "When Arnold Schwarzenegger vetoed the same-sex marriage bill, my blood was boiling. I had been silent, but that night, Brad and I watched the news and saw all these young people pouring out on Santa Monica Boulevard venting their rage, and I said, 'I have to speak out.'": "George",
  "I think Donald Trump's interpretation of marriage is something that he himself doesn't really believe in. 'Traditional marriage' is where two people love each other, commit to each other, care for each other over the years. It is a meaningful ceremony, and his interpretation of that is not recognizing what real marriage is.": "George",
  "I'd like to think that, when I explain it, that Mr. Trump will understand marriage is defined by two people who love each other, commit to each other, and will care for each other through thick and thin.": "George",
  "When Brad and I got married in 2008, it got a lot of attention. And all the attention was over the fact that we were two men, but people were hardly conscious of the fact that we were entering into an interracial marriage. That's wonderful, because it was only 50 years ago with Loving v. Virginia that interracial marriages were made legal.": "George",
  "I spent most of my life from 24 to 31 at the office. I wasn't going to people's weddings I wasn't cultivating my marriage. I wasn't happy. ": "Megyn",
  "Once I found professional happiness, it gave me time to think about other areas in my life in which I wasn't happy. The next obvious candidate for introspection was my marriage.": "Megyn",

  "I have nothing against her, and in fact I'm very fond of my first wife. But we should have ended that marriage eight or 10 years earlier.": "Michael",
  "It took me too long to realise that if you go to a marriage counsellor to resolve problems, it's in his interest to keep the marriage going.": "Michael",
  "California is a bellwether state. California was the first state in the United States to overturn the laws against interracial marriage. It took 19 years for the rest of the country to come around to that point of view.": "Gavin",
  "Separate is not equal. Civil unions are civil unions. Marriage is marriage. They're different institutions.": "Gavin",
  "Prop 8 did something that no other state in the history of this country has done. It took away the rights of people that already were legally affirmed. Imagine someone putting something on the ballot saying your wedding, your marriage is no longer valid.": "Gavin",
  "It's like, 'Oh, well of course you want gay marriage, you're gay.' I think when heterosexual people are talking to their peers and they're like, 'This is an equal rights thing,' it's a little bit easier.": "Jillian",
  "You know, I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.": "Carly",
  "Just going through a marriage and a divorce - which I essentially did by 21 - will give you an insane amount of perspective on life.": "Solange",
  "I don't know about marriage as much as I do know that I'd be a great father.": "Tyler",
  "I don't think it's in any way harmful, this marriage of media and politicians. I think it enhances the communications process considerably and makes it possible for the public to be far more aware, far more up-to-date on issues and the opposite sides of the issues.": "Walter",
  "I had a very wise person tell me that he thinks marriage, when you're younger, you keep thinking you can fix things. That's what people do. And you can't really fix anything. It shouldn't be a massive difficult thing every day. Life's difficult enough.": "Albert",
  "To me, marriage is really important and what we build families on. That's why gay marriage is really important.": "Margaret",
  "I refused David Letterman's proposal of marriage for obvious reasons, but thanks for asking.": "Teri",
  "I think there's something unromantic about marriage. You're closing yourself off.": "Hugh",
  "I think marriage is only necessary if you've got children. It's quite nice for them.": "Hugh",
  "When I went to college, as much as my parents emphasized academic achievement, they emphasized marriage even more. They told me that the most eligible women marry young to get a 'good man' before they are all taken.": "Sheryl",
  "I don't know of many evangelicals who want to deny gay couples their legal rights. However, most of us don't want to call it marriage, because we think that word has religious connotations, and we're not ready to see it used in ways that offend us.": "Tony",
  "But I think it's up to a local congregation to determine whether or not a marriage should be blessed of God. And it shouldn't be up to the government.": "Tony",
  "President Bush once said that marriage is a sacred institution and should be reserved for the union of one man and one woman. If this is the case - and most Americans would agree with him on this - then I have to ask: Why is the government at all involved in marrying people?": "Tony",
  "If marriage really is a sacred institution, then why is the government controlling it, especially in a nation that affirms separation of church and state?": "Tony",
  "Marriage should be viewed as an institution ordained by God and should be out of the control of the state.": "Tony",
  "I can't imagine having a real personal thing, like divorce and marriage, all those things, being in the public eye. I try to not talk about anything personal, and then nobody has the fire to throw back at you, like 'You said this back then!'": "Kirsten",
  "Divorce is not the end of the world. It's worse to stay in an unhealthy marriage. That's a worse example for the children.": "Jerry",
  "Getting a divorce is always horrible because you feel you've failed. Everyone hates to give up on a marriage. You think your family's broken up.": "Jerry",
  "The only reason I got married in 2003 was for my children. I had a therapist who said marriage is really a container for a family, and that made sense to me.": "Julianne",
  "Marriage and family are ordained of God. The family is the most important social unit in time and in eternity. Under God's great plan of happiness, families can be sealed in temples and be prepared to return to dwell in His holy presence forever. That is eternal life!": "Russell",

  "There are members - very, very close and dear members - of my family - I'm talking immediate family - who simply don't speak to me anymore and haven't done so for years. My marriage fell apart.": "Maajid",
  "What is marriage, is marriage protection or religion, is marriage renunciation or abundance, is marriage a stepping-stone or an end. What is marriage.": "Gertrude",
  "Everyone saw me on TV or read articles, and it was all about my great marriage, the white picket fence, all this success and my perfect life. But behind the scenes, it was a struggle.": "Lindsey",
  "Everyone knows marriage is tough.": "Lindsey",
  "I failed at the biggest things there are in life. I failed in my health, I failed in my marriage, I failed in everything, and I've picked myself up and gone on.": "Sharon",
  "I think it's best if there's an amendment that goes on the ballot where the people can weigh in. Every time this issue has gone on the ballot, the people have voted to retain the traditional definition of marriage as recently as California in 2008.": "Michele",
  "I do support a constitutional amendment on marriage between a man and a woman, but I would not be going into the states to overturn their state law.": "Michele",
  "Even after marriage, our home is important for us.": "Mahesh",
  "I was 21 and had been going out with my boyfriend for two years when I found out I was pregnant - despite being told by doctors that I was sterile. Jamie's father and I hadn't discussed marriage, and to me, it wasn't something to be entered into just to stop gossip.": "Joanna",
  "In terms of the legal matter of creating a contract between two people that's called marriage, and allowing them to live together with the protection of law, it seems to me is the way we should be moving in this country.": "Colin",

  "Whether it be a matter of personal relations within a marriage or political initiatives within a peace process, there is no sure-fire do-it-yourself kit.": "Seamus",
  "Originally, I was against gay marriage because I was opposed to all marriage, being an old-fashioned gay bohemian. The straight people I knew in the sixties were very much opposed to it. I was, too, and it was never a possibility for gays, but when I saw how opposed the Religious Right was to it, I thought it a fight worth fighting.": "Edmund",
  "The culmination of a long struggle was 2013, which could clearly be labeled the Year of the Gay. State after state had legalized gay marriage, despite intense opposition from the religious right.": "Edmund",
  "I don't have to get married myself in order to campaign on behalf of gay marriage.": "Edmund",
  "I've always deplored bad heterosexual values that dictate the minute a marriage is over the former partners no longer speak to each other only straights could be so cruel and inhuman as to reject totally the person with whom they've shared their life for 20 or 30 years. ": "Edmund",
  "First, I was opposed to gay marriage because it seemed like one more way that gays were wanting to assimilate. When I realized the Christian right was so opposed to it, as well as tyrannical governments in Africa and Russia, I thought, 'It must be a good thing to fight for.'": "Edmund",
  "Just like Barack Obama, my views on gay marriage have evolved, and now I am a reluctant groom.": "Edmund",
  "Originally I was opposed to gay assimilation and targeted gay marriage as just another effort on the part of gays to resemble their straight neighbours.": "Edmund",
  "I believe the GOP should pitch its big-top tent around fiscal conservatism and a muscular foreign policy rather than carnival bark outside the sideshow tents of gay marriage and reproductive choice.": "Roger",
  "My kids have moved more in their twenties, you know, than my parents have moved in nearly 40-something years of marriage before they died. So there's a part of me that laments what we have lost, and that is a sense of community.": "Mike",
  "Marriage has historically, as long as there's been human history, meant a man and a woman in a relationship for life. Once we change that definition, then where does it go from there?": "Mike",
  "Marriage should be reinforced, not redefined.": "Mike",
  "You can spend the day at work, but when you go home, and you're in the role of a father or a husband, you don't have to remind yourself that you shouldn't tell your wife to hold the messages. If you do, that marriage is not going to last very long.": "Hannah",
  "I have a lot of skepticism about marriage and monogamy.": "Rashida",
  "Marriage feels like an industry with catering and really expensive bands.": "Rashida",
  "Take this marriage thing seriously - it has to last all the way to the divorce.": "Roseanne",
  "I was raised on government cheese. As an adult, in my first marriage, my husband and I worked real hard just to go bankrupt. I happened to write some jokes about it. I did real well for myself.": "Roseanne",
  "My mum told me, 'At that moment when you know you can't do both, the marriage and the kids, choose the marriage because you're going to be spending your whole lives together, so you have to put a lot of work and attention into the relationship.'": "Bryce",
  "People say, 'What's the secret to a marriage?' There's no secret - I think you get lucky.": "Steve",
  "I hate when people think you're broken because your parents are divorced. And I really reject the idea of staying together for the kids. If they're growing up in a house that's not healthy, it's better to know that's not the model of what marriage should be.": "Anna",
  "Woman, or more precisely put, perhaps, marriage, is the representative of life with which you are meant to come to terms.": "Franz",
  "Usually, the fairy tale ends with the girl marrying the prince. But mine started as soon as the marriage was over.": "Diane",
  "Marriage was never a destination with me.": "Diane",
  "I think it's important to remember that you go into something like marriage knowing that you don't know very much about it at all. But I do look at the marriage of my mother and stepdad, and what makes it work for them is that it's a team effort.": "Justin",
  "It's the same girl-who-has-everything story. You know, the one where she's insecure and scared and unhappy and has marriage problems and doesn't know how to handle stardom and screws up right and left and gets in with the wrong people and goes down the drain.": "Natalie",
  "Of course I believe in love despite four divorces. There is nobody who doesn't believe in love. But marriage - that fits some people but obviously not me.": "Sean",
  "You know the fairy-tale drill, especially from the Disney versions: the heroines endure awful stuff in rites of passage that lead to a joyous resolution of, usually, marriage to a prince. 'Into the Woods' follows that template, then asks, 'What happens after Happy Ever After?'": "Richard",
  "But the key to our marriage is the capacity to give each other a break. And to realize that it's not how our similarities work together it's how our differences work together. ": "Michael",
  "I believe in the family. I believe in marriage, and I think it's such a great institution. I think men should be able to marry each other, and women should be able to marry each other.": "David",
  "I'll say this: The media wasn't invited to my marriage, and they're definitely not invited into the divorce.": "Ryan",
  "I am a fan of marriage and a fan of being committed to the right person.": "Joan",
  "Having had five husbands, I guess I should know a thing or two about marriage.": "Joan",
  "It's such a strange marriage, a song and someone that sings it. When that works, it really works, and when it doesn't, it doesn't.": "Chris",
  "A successful marriage is a decision. You decide it's going to work. You can't always be there, but you have to be there enough. And you have to make sure you are where you're needed most.": "Nancy",
  "I am not into marriage. You look at all the marriages breaking down and all the people cheating on their marriages, and you become cynical. Marriage is nothing but a label.": "Nargis",
  "I ran to my marriage, I was happily ready to take on marriage.": "Mark",
  "My first marriage ended after 24 years.": "Jerry",
  "If two people cannot live together, both should have the right to opt out of the marriage. In an ideal world, that would be an acceptable solution.": "Kapil",

  "Older couples bring obligations such as support payments and debt as well as decades of financial experience to a marriage.": "Jean",
  "At the time of my second marriage, my husband was in his early 50s, I was in my mid-40s, and we each had two kids. We maintained our individual accounts and opened one for the house. We each kick the same percentage of our incomes into the house account and have a joint credit card. But we pay for our children separately.": "Jean",
  "Right now, I'm not really thinking about marriage.": "Adam",
  "My father, a refugee from Eastern Europe, was preparing a fraudulent marriage to an American citizen as a route to this country when he was sponsored, making fraud unnecessary. My wife's grandfather bought papers from another Chinese villager to be able to come to the United States.": "Nicholas",
  "When you cut your life into a film - 90-some minutes of film - you end up taking snapshots and vignettes of the highlights of it - marriage, divorce, death, success, fame, loss. The up and the down and the up again.": "David",
  "Regency romances end in marriage zombie stories end in the zombies being vanquished. 'Pride and Prejudice and Zombies' delivers both. ": "Adam",
  "In Hungary, if homosexuals would like to live together, they can do so under the civil code. But what we call marriage is exclusively for one man and one woman. We are a Christian country. That's a historical fact.": "Viktor",
  "My marriage is incredibly important to me. It's the place from which I engage in the world every day, and the place to which I return every day.": "Chelsea",
  "Marriage is a feast where the grace is sometimes better than the dinner.": "Charles",
  "The funny thing about 'Take Shelter' is that a lot of people talk about how it was allegory for the economy and things that were to happen. And that was so on the nose in the movie for me. I was like, 'That's obvious.' It's the other stuff about marriage and commitment and those other things that I spent the most time thinking about.": "Jeff",
  "Marriage isn't about a collection of scenes over ten years of two people telling each other that they love each other. It's about commitment.": "Jeff",
  "Marriage is a very good thing, but I think it's a mistake to make a habit out of it.": "W.",
  "Marriage can be tricky and challenging at times.": "John",
  "With the notion of marriage - an exclusive, emotional, binding 'til death do you part' tie - becoming more and more an exception to the rule given a rise in cohabitation and high rates of divorce, why should the federal government be telling adults who love one another that they cannot get married simply because they happen to be gay?": "Lisa",
  "I believe when there are so many forces pulling our society apart, we need more commitment to marriage, not less.": "Lisa",
  "Like the majority of Alaskans, I supported a constitutional amendment in 1998 defining marriage as only between a man and a woman, but my thinking has evolved as America has witnessed a clear cultural shift.": "Lisa",
  "I have voted in support of efforts in the Senate to enact a Constitutional amendment that would have limited marriage to one man and one woman only.": "Lisa",

  "Marriage is gonna be your stability through everything.": "Miranda",
  "Marriage is a lot of things - a source of love, security, the joy of children, but it's also an interpersonal battlefield, and it's not hard to see why: Take two disparate people, toss them together in often-confined quarters, add the stresses of money and kids - now lather, rinse, repeat for the rest of your natural life. What could go wrong?": "Jeffrey",
  "The death of anti-gay hate speech is no doubt being hastened by the head-spinning speed with which gays as a group - to say nothing of gay marriage - are becoming an unremarkable and even quite traditional parts of American life.": "Jeffrey",
  "The high arts of literature and music stand in a curious relationship to one another, at once securely comfortable and deeply uneasy - rather like a long-term marriage.": "Will",

  "I have gone from one relationship to a marriage and stepchildren.": "Daryl",
  "My mother had a son from previous marriage and her husband died in Second World War.": "Mikhail",
  "There's already a marriage clock, a career clock, a biological clock. Sometimes being a woman feels like standing in the lobby of a hotel, looking at the dials depicting every time zone in the world behind the front desk - except they all apply to you, and all at once.": "Sloane",
  "My wife and I have what's known as mixed marriage. I am a Methodist, she is a Muslim. So we're keeping it in the M's.": "Grover",
  "Gay rights is just a matter of time. Look at the polls. Worrying about gay marriage, let alone gay civil unions or gay employment rights, is a middle-age issue. Young people just can't see the problem. At worst, gays are going to win this one just by waiting until the opposition dies off.": "Gail",
  "My brother married young, and his is the best marriage I know.": "Maeve",
  "I am a big, confident, happy woman who had a loving childhood, a pleasant career, and a wonderful marriage. I feel very lucky.": "Maeve",
  "No matter how committed a marriage, there will always be other people - those we have chemistry with and those we don't, those we are attracted to, and those who shop for functional outdoors wear. The sooner a couple can accept the existence of the former and exchange a few basic reassurances concerning them, the easier life gets.": "Lynn",
  "I couldn't bear a marriage in which one partner hinges on the other.": "Clive",

  "Mike Huckabee represents something that is either tremendously encouraging or deeply disturbing, depending on your point of view: a marriage of Christian fundamentalism with economic populism.": "Matt",
  "The hypocrisy and false piety of the deniers aside, the relationships of gays have no effect on heteros. Especially all the heteros who've done such a marvelous job of debasing marriage on their own all these many years.": "John",
  "Gay marriage will be universally accepted in time. But if I may be so bold as to say to gays and lesbians, don't wait for that time to arrive. Just as my father and his generation did not 'wait' for their civil rights, nor should you. The toothpaste ain't going back in the tube. The tide has turned.": "John",
  "Until politicos take a true stand in defense of marriage by proposing an anti-adultery amendment to the Constitution, stop demonizing gays and lesbians when the one debasing your marriage is the individual in the mirror.": "John",

  "I took all my TV experience and what I learned about - by writing and directing and bringing a movie to Sundance - about the realities of the independent film market: 'Transparent' is the marriage of those two situations.": "Jill",
  "Like everything which is not the involuntary result of fleeting emotion but the creation of time and will, any marriage, happy or unhappy, is infinitely more interesting than any romance, however passionate.": "W.",
  "I was born to be married. I just feel comfortable there. I love the idea of being partnered for ever. I love my girlfriend, we've been best friends since I was 18.

  "I'll always be sad that my marriage ended.": "Shania",
  "I have never wanted a family. I don't believe in marriage, though I obviously believe it should be legal for everyone who wants to do it. But it is not something I believe in, nor do the characters in my book, nor do any of my friends.": "Hanya",
  "Righteous marriage is a commandment and an essential step in the process of creating a loving family relationship that can be perpetuated beyond the grave.": "David",
  "The government shouldn't be involved in this because it's very simple. If you don't believe in same-sex marriage, then don't marry somebody of the same sex.": "Wanda",
  "I am drawn to the mystery of marriage. You can never know what the contract is between two people, and that is a very strong subject. I think it may be my subject.": "Mike",
  "My wife - I married my onscreen girlfriend from 'Growing Pains', Mike Seaver's girlfriend, and we've been married for 17 years - so marriage is very important to us.": "Kirk",
  "Marriage was defined by God a long time ago. Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve - one man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage. And I don't think anyone else should either.": "Kirk",
  "Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.": "Ellen",
  "During the periods in my marriage when I chose to stay home with my kids rather than work as an attorney, it caused me no end of anxiety. Despite the fact that I knew I was contributing to our family by caring for our children, I still felt that my worth was less because I wasn't earning.": "Ayelet",
  "The ever clearer consciousness that love can dispense with marriage, yet marriage cannot dispense with love, is already partially recognized by modern society, by the facility of divorce.": "Ellen",
  "In Hollywood a marriage is a success if it outlasts milk.": "Rita",
  "Marriage is obsolete and a trap.": "Catherine",
  "Europe in general is a great place for me, but specifically Germany has been very good to me. Germans love classical music... Electronic dance music is massive over there, so I'm kind of the marriage between the two.": "Lindsey",
  "I think people should be authentic and who they are. If that calls people to same-sex attraction and same-sex marriage, then they should be true to who they are, and I think that the world could benefit by more love.": "Chris",
  "First thing I said to him was, 'LeBron, you know this is true. We had five good years and one bad night'. Like a marriage that's good, and then one bad thing happens, and you never talk to each other again.": "Dan",
  "There is a kind of woman who is economically powerful, professionally powerful, who threatens a white male grip on power that has a long historic precedent in the country. Independent women living outside of marriage threaten all kinds of things about the way power is supposed to work.": "Rebecca",
  "One of the favorite conservative themes is that the cure for poverty is more marriage and earlier marriage. We hear that all the time; there have been billions of dollars now, between the Bush administration and the Obama administration, which has continued the marriage education program, on trying to get more people to get married.": "Rebecca",
  "It was a perfect marriage. She didn't want to and he couldn't.": "Spike",
  "I think growing up in a big family taught me a lot of problem solving and how to share and compromise, and that's been helpful in my marriage.": "Sarah",
  "I like marriage. The idea.": "Toni",
  "I think it's unfortunate that there exists only one path in America to complete social legitimacy, and that is marriage. I think, for instance, that it would be far easier for Americans to elect a black president or a female president than an unmarried president.": "Elizabeth",
  "Even though my first marriage broke up, I'd say that I've had two good marriages and two good men. I've been very lucky. I like to think it's karma because, in a relationship, I give 300 per cent. I'm straight with my men, and I like to think it comes back.": "Suzi",
  "There comes a crossroads in every marriage where you grow together or grow apart. I outgrew Len. He wanted me to be in that leather jumpsuit for the rest of my life and do nothing else. He constrained me. It got to a point where the marriage died or I did.": "Suzi",
  "Some of us stay married because we're in competition with our divorcing 1960s and 1970s parents, who made such a hash of it. What looks appealing to us now, in an increasingly frenetic, digital world, is the 1950s marriage.": "Sandra",
  "Marriage may be the closest thing to Heaven or Hell any of us will know on this earth.": "Edwin",
  "In 1977 we played America and Europe three times, and Japan - my marriage suffered as a result. My then wife took the kids to Canada to be near her parents.": "Phil",
  "A miracle... my biggest accomplishment is my marriage so far. Because it's hard, everyone knows it's hard.": "Gwen",
  "I've always thought of, of a relationship with an actor to an audience as a marriage, you know. And a story, you know. And there are ups and downs, and you work through them, and you work with them.": "John",
  "Getting divorced just because you don't love a man is almost as silly as getting married just because you do.": "Zsa",
  "If you like a man and he likes you, you should get married as fast as you can. Otherwise, you both are going to change your minds. There's plenty of time for that after marriage.": "Zsa",
  "Of course I love being in love - but it is marriage that really fulfills me. But not in every case.": "Zsa",
  "If the present Mrs. Wogan has a fault - and I must tread carefully here - if she has a fault, this gem in the diadem of womanhood is a hoarder. She never throws anything out. Which may explain the longevity of our marriage.": "Terry",
  "Marriage is traditionally old-school in many respects. It is highly antiquated, and, that being said, beautiful.": "Lake",
  "I have never been in favor of gay marriage, and I am not in favor of gay marriage.": "Pete",
  "It isn't tying himself to one woman that a man dreads when he thinks of marrying it's separating himself from all the others. ": "Helen",
  "A husband is what is left of a lover, after the nerve has been extracted.": "Helen",
  "In olden times sacrifices were made at the altar - a practice which is still continued.": "Helen",

  "Men need marriage more than women do. In fact, they need it to survive.": "Hanna",
  "Getting divorced didn't sour me on the institution of marriage. I'll tell you what I'll never do: I'll never get divorced again.": "Eddie",
  "I grew up in a Hindu household but went to a Roman Catholic school. I grew up with a mother who said, 'I'll arrange a marriage for you at 18,' but she also said that we could achieve anything we put our minds to an encourage us to dream of becoming prime minister or president.": "Indra",
  "Most of these alternative arrangements, so-called, arise out of the ruins of marriages, not as an improvement of old fashioned marriage.": "Christopher",

  "Love is often the fruit of marriage.": "Moliere",
  "My argument is simple, which is, that for several thousand years in Western civilization, marriage has been the union of one man and one woman. Research is overwhelming that children need mothers and fathers.": "Gary",
  "The institution of marriage works better when there's a spiritual connection. If you're marrying just for the sake of the woman, then you may lose interest in each other very soon. When we marry in the interest of the Holy Spirit with the intention of serving God and humanity, then it gives a much larger perspective.": "A.",
  "Protecting the institution of marriage safeguards, I believe, the American family.": "John",
  "If you want to read about love and marriage, you've got to buy two separate books.": "Alan",
  "If you made a list of reasons why any couple got married, and another list of the reasons for their divorce, you'd have a hell of a lot of overlapping.": "Mignon",
  "I think that marriage is, dare I say it, between a man and a woman, hopefully for life and there are all sorts of other relationships which should be acknowledged and recognised, but I don't know that they can be recognised as marriage.": "Tony",
  "Never feel remorse for what you have thought about your wife she has thought much worse things about you. ": "Jean",
  "Marriage is something that needs to be worked on every day. I don't know if I'm the one to give marital advice since I've only been married for a little over a year, but marriage is certainly easier if you are open, trusting and loving.": "Emily",
  "Marriage is really tough because you have to deal with feelings... and lawyers.": "Richard",
  "Any sex outside of the marriage bond between a man and a woman is violating God's law.": "Jerry",
  "I think like any marriage, especially when you've had divorced parents like myself; you want to try even harder to make it work.": "Princess",
  "Of course I dream to have this perfect man who does not want to change me. And I'm so not marriage material, it's terrible. But my dream is to have those Sunday mornings, where you're eating breakfast and reading newspapers with somebody.": "Marina",
  "If dysfunction means that a family doesn't work, then every family ambles into some arena in which that happens, where relationships get strained or even break down entirely. We fail each other or disappoint each other. That goes for parents, siblings, kids, marriage partners - the whole enchilada.": "Mary",
  "For my parents' generation, the idea was not that marriage was about some kind of idealized, romantic love; it was a partnership. It's about creating family; it's about creating offspring. Indian culture is essentially much more of a 'we' culture. It's a communal culture where you do what's best for the community - you procreate.": "Aasif",
  "Marriage has a unique place because it speaks of an absolute faithfulness, a covenant between radically different persons, male and female; and so it echoes the absolute covenant of God with his chosen, a covenant between radically different partners.": "Rowan",
  "Only choose in marriage a man whom you would choose as a friend if he were a woman.": "Joseph",
  "As I grew up and began identifying myself as a feminist, there were plenty of issues that continued to make me question marriage: the father 'giving' the bride away, women taking their husband's last name, the white dress, the vows promising to 'obey' the groom. And that only covers the wedding.": "Jessica",
  "A man may do worse than make what the world calls a not wholly happy marriage.": "Thomas",
  "From 1865 to 1965, my race, the black race, was one of the most competitive, entrepreneurial, Christian, moral races in our country. We had the highest percentage of entrepreneurs in the country, the highest percentage of marriage in the country.": "Burgess",
  "When you realise that money doesn't actually make you happy, it's a quick fix to have things you've always wanted, but then when you have it, you realise that's not what actually makes you happy. It's more about having a great marriage and happy children; that's what life's all about.": "Shane",
  "Do the bishops seriously imagine that legalising gay marriage will result in thousands of parties to heterosexual marriages suddenly deciding to get divorced so they can marry a person of the same sex?": "Malcolm",
  "There are four stages in a marriage. First there's the affair, then the marriage, then children and finally the fourth stage, without which you cannot know a woman, the divorce.": "Norman",
  "When you have a baby, love is automatic, when you get married, love is earned.": "Marie",
  "Marriage is anti-romantic - husband and wife are terms like 'turkey' and 'goose.' Worse, they denote ownership.": "Thomas",
  "Yes, I am seeking a husband. As soon as the right man asks me, I shall say, 'It is not good for a woman to live alone.'": "Anna",
  "If I get married, I think I'd pick out a newspaperman rather than a millionaire. A newspaperman is a regular fellow.": "Anna",
  "I've had an exciting time I married for love and got a little money along with it. ": "Rose",
  "I am for gay marriage. Or same-sex marriage. I don't want to say it the wrong way. I think people are sensitive to it. I have been painted as being this right-wing zealot on choice. Nothing could be further from the truth.": "Harold",

  "Marriage is a bribe to make the housekeeper think she's a householder.": "Thornton",
  "I was a Christian. I didn't want to have sex before marriage, I was a bit uptight and not very self-confident. I was a virgin until I was 26.": "Jimmy",
  "I don't know that human beings were meant to mate for life or be monogamous. But, for me, the aspect of marriage that is troubling is that it's a contract that is governed by the state, and I don't want the state to have control over my personal affairs.": "Laura",
  "Marriage is a great institution.": "Elizabeth",
  "Yes, my mom does keep making references to marriage, like all mothers do, but it's only in a lighter mood... she just jokes.": "Saina",
  "Often it's a lack of time, not taste, that leads someone to hire a decorator. A good decorator/client relationship should be like a marriage. The time one puts in needs to be extensive. One needs to listen to them and understand what they like and how they live.": "Nicholas",

  "I don't understand what the big deal is with gay marriage. Get over it, people.": "Kristin",
  "By our Heavenly Father and only because of God, only because of God. We're like other couples. We do not get along perfectly; we do not go without arguments and, as I call them, fights, and heartache and pain and hurting each other. But a marriage is three of us.": "Barbara",
  "The best way to get most husbands to do something is to suggest that perhaps they're too old to do it.": "Ann",
  "My parents did not have a perfect marriage. It was pretty good, but it was not perfect. My marriage is not perfect. My wife is, but I happen to be imperfect. However, that does not discount the fact that the definition of marriage must be defended and protected.": "Stockwell",
  "Marriage requires a special talent, like acting. Monogamy requires genius.": "Warren",
  "Do not miss your children's childhood. Do not be away 200 nights a year as I was. Do not put strains on your marriage or family.": "Joe",
  "I listen to the people. That was a big reason for my life, maybe the main reason, I'm singing because I love it when people say to me, 'Thank you.' I thank them. It's a marriage.": "Julio",
  "I say I never wanna get married. I feel trapped with the idea of marriage. How can you really be with somebody forever? I'd get bored! As I get older, I don't settle. I'd rather tell somebody 'This is what I want - take it or leave it.'": "Amanda",
  "I was made to believe there was a plan in place for ending Donald's previous marriage. I pulled away because I wanted to allow him the time to deal with his wife.": "Marla",
  "Alzheimer's disease is never an 'accident' in a marriage. It falls under the purview of God's sovereignty. In the case of someone with Alzheimer's, this means God's unconditional and sacrificial love has an opportunity to be even more gloriously displayed in a life together.": "Joni",

  "American liberals have become addicted to the courtroom, relying on judges and lawyers rather than elected leaders and the ballot box, as the primary means of effecting their social agenda on everything from gay marriage to assisted suicide to the use of vouchers for private-school education.": "Neil",
  "I believe that if man and woman cherish the same ideals and think alike, then the marriage can be complementary to each other's work instead of being a hindrance.": "Munshi",
  "But I wanted marriage for myself. I was not calculating about it. I wish I was more calculating.": "Linda",
  "I wanted to marry a girl just like my mom.": "Michael",
  "I enjoy being single, but I loved being married.": "Stephanie",
  "Another argument, vaguer and even less persuasive, is that gay marriage somehow does harm to heterosexual marriage. I have yet to meet anyone who can explain to me what this means. In what way would allowing same-sex partners to marry diminish the marriages of heterosexual couples?": "Ted",
  "If you cannot work on the marriage or the women is a moron, staying married and cheating makes the most sense because divorce is disruptive to the family life and your bank account.": "Al",
  "That is why I fought against abortion and that is why if I were still in the Senate I would be doing everything I could to defend the sanctity of marriage.": "Jesse",
  "But to sustain a marriage for 50 years, you have to get real a little bit and find someone who is understanding and who you can grow with. My mom always says, 'Marry the man who loves you a millimeter more.'": "Ali",

  "Marriage is a financial contract I have enough contracts already. ": "Linda",
  "My parents' long and happy marriage was a great ideal to live up to, but a tough one.": "Olivia",
  "In France, I guess there's something like a tyranny in mentalities - we accept success badly, beauty, money. People are certainly envious, and this creates negative energy. This is annoying. I suffered a great deal at one time. I had to fight harder than others. Add to that my marriage to Polanski.": "Emmanuelle",
  "When I was younger, I wanted to marry early, like at 23. Year by year, I found things I wanted to do, and the thought of marriage disappeared. But I don't want to marry too late. Around 31?": "Park",
  "I might be celibate, but I appreciate the wonder of the sacrament of marriage.": "Keith",

  "Redefining marriage will have huge implications for what is taught in our schools, and for wider society.

  "Motherhood is not what was left over after our Father blessed His sons with priesthood ordination. It was the most ennobling endowment He could give His daughters, a sacred trust that gave women an unparalleled role in helping His children keep their second estate.": "Sheri",
  "If you don't like Beyonce, then it's hard for me to trust you. It's like not liking world peace.": "Seinabo",

  "I trust Canadians' capacity to determine who will sit in their Parliament.": "Justin",
  "There's nothing fun about stuff like estate planning, getting mammograms, or talking to a guy about long term disability insurance, but do it anyway. Trust me, the stress of not having done the above is prematurely aging.": "Jen",

  "I used to trust people easily, but now I'm a little careful because some experiences have taught me to not trust anyone blindly.": "Shraddha",

  "When truth takes a backseat to ego and politics, trust is lost.": "Patrick",
  "I always think about the idea that God never gives you more than you can handle, and just the idea that God would be looking at me and thinking, 'Eh, I think she can handle more.'

  "The fact is, with every friendship you make, and every bond of trust you establish, you are shaping the image of America projected to the rest of the world. That is so important. So when you study abroad, you're actually helping to make America stronger.": "Michelle",
  "I don't trust doctors. It's not to say there ain't some good ones, but on a general level, no, I wouldn't trust 'em at all.": "Keith",
  "Inner-life questions are the kind everyone asks, with or without benefit of God-talk: 'Does my life have meaning and purpose?' 'Do I have gifts that the world wants and needs?' 'Whom and what shall I serve?' 'Whom and what can I trust?' 'How can I rise above my fears?'": "Parker",
  "I'm a product of a military dictatorship. Under a dictatorship, you cannot trust information or dispense it freely because of censorship. So Brazilians become very flexible in the use of metaphors. They learn to communicate with double meanings.": "Vik",
  "You have to believe in yourself and only trust your own vision and instincts. If I'd listened to what other people thought about my work in the first 10 years that I was a writer, I never would have made it to begin with.": "Philipp",
  "If you're not comfortable with public speaking - and nobody starts out comfortable; you have to learn how to be comfortable - practice. I cannot overstate the importance of practicing. Get some close friends or family members to help evaluate you, or somebody at work that you trust.": "Hillary",
  "I have a great agency! It's definitely team work with my fashion career. The trick is to surround yourself with the best people, those whose opinions you really trust and value.": "Suki",
  "Young men, trust God, and make the future bright with blessing. Old men, trust God, and magnify him for all the mercies of the past.": "Charles",
  "Trust is not very easy for me at all. I want to be a trusting person, but I've been bruised so many times - not to sound woe-is-me about my life.": "Mariah",
  "If you're not open, you're not transparent, you're still holding on to vaults of information, you're not going to build that trust.": "Gavin",
  "I want my clients to trust me.": "Brad",
  "My evidence that I am saved does not lie in the fact that I preach, or that I do this or that. All my hope lies in this: that Jesus Christ came to save sinners. I am a sinner, I trust Him, then He came to save me, and I am saved.": "Charles",
  "To some extent I happily don't know what I'm doing. I feel that it's an artist's responsibility to trust that.": "David",
  "The key is to get to know people and trust them to be who they are. Instead, we trust people to be who we want them to be - and when they're not, we cry.": "David",

  "I think one of the coolest things about the job is the level of trust we have for each other. The actors fully trust that the writers will write amazing episodes, and the writers trust that the actors will follow their instincts with the characters.": "John",
  "I was no chief and never had been, but because I had been more deeply wronged than others, this honor was conferred upon me, and I resolved to prove worthy of the trust.": "Geronimo",
  "Our job as friends, mentors, parents, and writing coaches is not to write anyone's college essay. That's cheating. Plus, it sends a discouraging message to the teenager that he or she can't be trusted with this important assignment. Trust the student to write the essay, but verify that it gets done. Gentle editing and proofreading are allowed.": "Kate",
  "You know, at the end of the day, the only thing you have is trust and honor in this world. That's all you have. All you have is your reputation built on trust and your personal honor. When you don't have that anymore, well, you know, there you go. Trust was broken.": "George",

  "Of course you can't 'trust' what people tell you on the web anymore than you can 'trust' what people tell you on megaphones, postcards or in restaurants. Working out the social politics of who you can trust and why is, quite literally, what a very large part of our brain has evolved to do.": "Douglas",
  "An essay is a thing of the imagination. If there is information in an essay, it is by-the-by, and if there is an opinion, one need not trust it for the long run. A genuine essay rarely has an educational, polemical, or sociopolitical use; it is the movement of a free mind at play.": "Cynthia",
  "People come into your life and people leave it... you just have to trust that life has a road mapped out for you.": "Orlando",
  "While day by day the overzealous student stores up facts for future use, he who has learned to trust nature finds need for ever fewer external directions. He will discard formula after formula, until he reaches the conclusion: Let nature take its course.": "Larry",
  "Don't trust anyone over 30.": "Pat",

  "Quakers almost as good as colored. They call themselves friends and you can trust them every time.": "Harriet",
  "Federalism is no longer the fault line of Centre-State relations but the definition of a new partnership of Team India. Citizens now have the ease of trust, not the burden of proof and process. Businesses find an environment that is open and easy to work in.": "Narendra",

  "When I was growing up, I was so fascinated by Mel Blanc and all of the different voices that he did for 'Looney Tunes' and watching Robin Williams record voice-over for the genie in 'Aladdin.'

  "I think the thing about love is that even though the things around us change, we as human beings, a lot of the ways we interact, and the ways we love each other is timeless. It requires trust, honesty, commitment, romance, and physical chemistry.": "John",
  "If you're an original thinker, you are going get told 'no' a lot, and you have to be able to hear 'no' many times from the bankers and trust that at some point, someone is going to recognize that you are an artist and not a can of soda.": "Nick",

  "Never trust a husband too far, nor a bachelor too near.": "Helen",
  "I like women, but you can't always trust them. Some of them are big liars, like this one woman I met who had a dog. I asked her her dog's name and then I asked, 'Does he bite?' and she said, 'No.' And I said, 'So how does he eat?' Liar!": "Demetri",

  "Thankfully, I have my mom and a small group of close friends who are there for me 24/7 and whom I can trust and depend on.": "Christina",

  "In any solid, good relationship, it takes a while to trust someone.": "Minka",
  "Because the Internet is so new, we still don't really understand what it is. We mistake it for a type of publishing or broadcasting, because that's what we're used to. So people complain that there's a lot of rubbish online, or that it's dominated by Americans, or that you can't necessarily trust what you read on the Web.": "Douglas",
  "People are really upside down. They want a government they can trust. They want one that's not going to raise their taxes by $15 billion and not lay off one state employee.": "Carl",

  "People might think that my queen should be highly educated, beautiful and the best of the best. Jetsun Pema is a kind-hearted girl who is very supportive and whom I can trust. I cannot say how she might appear to the people, but to me, she is the one.": "Jigme",

  "I do believe that it was through divine providence that the Founding Fathers drafted a document that created a government that didn't trust each other - hence the separation of powers. And then, to close the deal, the Bill of Rights was added to continue to protect individual rights and freedoms.": "John",
  "If you're going to counsel people - and that's all my ministry is, it's a counseling ministry more than anything else - people have to believe that they can trust you and that they can listen to you, that you're going to try to help them and not just politically try to convert them to your views.": "Robert",
  "The essence of good government is trust.": "Kathleen",
  "You must trust your instinct, intuition and judgment.": "Rouben",
  "Peer pressure is something everyone will face in school. You have to really go by what you think is the right thing to do. Turn to the friends you trust the most when you are put in a compromising situation. If your friends are making the wrong decision, then turn to your parents.": "Madisen",

  "There are many wonderful themes from 'Moana' that people discover, and I also hope they're inspired to go on their own journeys and to learn more about the Polynesian culture, because we're pretty great! I'm so proud of the people the filmmakers talked to - the Oceanic Trust.": "Auli'i",

  "Men trust their ears less than their eyes.": "Herodotus",
  "It's important to build trust if you're trying to deal with big things. Big issues require everybody to get outside their comfort zone, and people are more willing to do so if they believe that their partner is sincere in their efforts. And the only way you can do that is to engage them on a personal level.": "Jeb",
  "I believe that Americans should be deeply skeptical of government power. You cannot trust people in power. The founders knew that. That's why they divided power among three branches, to set interest against interest.": "James",

  "They say never trust a skinny chef, but the fact is, to stay healthy when you're a chef means you have to work twice as hard.": "Marcus",
  "Our goal is to desperately make the best products we can. We're not naive. We trust that if we're successful and we make good products, that people will like them. And we trust that if people like them, they'll buy them. And we figured out the operation and we're effective. We know what we're doing, so we'll make money, but it's a consequence.": "Jonathan",
  "You cannot have a relationship with someone you can't trust.": "Sheri",
  "I've spent years trying to time up my drops with my throws. You learn to listen to your feet and trust your positions.": "Aaron",
  "I love to dance, so I'm definitely always the first one out on the dance floor. And when it comes to guys, I don't get shy. So if I wasn't with a date, I wouldn't have a problem going up to a guy and just saying, 'Are you gonna dance with me?' Trust me, it'll work for you too! Guys like it when you aren't afraid to make the first move.": "Kylie",
  "Takers believe in a zero-sum world, and they end up creating one where bosses, colleagues and clients don't trust them. Givers build deeper and broader relationships - people are rooting for them instead of gunning for them.": "Adam",
  "Trust not yourself, but your defects to know, make use of every friend and every foe.": "Alexander",
  "We have an opportunity, but we have an obligation to senior citizens and to the younger people who are entering the workforce today to help ensure that they are going to be able to trust the government to have a workable program that benefits them as well.": "Thad",
  "With any work worth its salt, you have to trust the author enough to take its measure. And if you apply too many preconceptions, you are not taking its measure.": "Art",

  "It's probably a bit of a power trip when you befriend somebody enough that they trust you to tell you things.": "Josh",
  "Once players have my trust, they have it.": "Terry",
  "Sometimes people don't trust the force of kindness. They think love or compassion or kindness will make you weak and kind of stupid and people will take advantage of you you won't stand up for other people. ": "Sharon",
  "It is a well known urban myth that the French don't trust banks and store their money under their mattress. It's not that they are tight with money - they just don't trust anyone.": "Janine",
  "I don't even know what a traditional producer is or does. I feel like the job is like being a coach, building good work habits and building trust. You want to get to a point where you can say anything and talk about anything. There needs to be a real connection.": "Rick",
  "You have to relax, write what you write. It sounds easy but it's really, really hard. One of the things it took me longest to learn was to trust the writing process.": "Diane",

  "The secret of a long life is to never trust a doctor.": "Luise",
  "As with any actor and any collaborator, it's about forming a trusting relationship. And that's not that you have to get him to trust you so you can get him to do what you want. Especially with a little kid, it's about making them feel really safe, and getting to know and not treating them as a puppet to be moved around.": "Lenny",
  "Speaking of trust, ever since I wrote this book, 'Liespotting,' no one wants to meet me in person anymore - no, no, no, no, no. They say, 'It's okay. We'll email you.' I can't even get a coffee date at Starbucks. My husband's like, 'Honey, deception? Maybe you could have focused on cooking. How about French cooking?'": "Pamela",
  "National security laws must protect national security. But they must also protect the public trust and preserve the ability of an informed electorate to hold its government to account.": "Al",

  "Liberty, as it is conceived by current opinion, has nothing inherent about it; it is a sort of gift or trust bestowed on the individual by the state pending good behavior.": "Mary",
  "Spirituality does two things for you. One, you are forced to become more selfless, two, you trust to providence. The opposite of a spiritual man is a materialist. If I was a materialist I would be making lots of money doing endorsements, doing cricket commentary. I have no interest in that.": "Imran",
  "Something goes wrong, I yell at them -'Fix it'- whether it's their fault or not. You can only really yell at the players you trust.": "Bill",

  "None of us and none of the Arabs trust Israel.": "Bashar",
  "Today I trust my instinct, I trust myself. Finally.": "Isabelle",

  "A man who does not trust himself will never really trust anybody.": "Jean",

  "Up against the corporate government, voters find themselves asked to choose between look-alike candidates from two parties vying to see who takes the marching orders from their campaign paymasters and their future employers. The money of vested interest nullifies genuine voter choice and trust.": "Ralph",

  "The best thing I've learned is, if you're going out, never go out alone - you leave yourself vulnerable. If you've got someone else there you trust, they can say, be wary of that person. I probably used to be too trusting of people.": "Daniel",
  "I am lucky to have advisers whom I trust.": "Monica",
  "We associate the North Atlantic with cod. The motto of Newfoundland used to be 'In cod we trust.' It was a joke, but it was essentially true. But there is no cod anymore. And that's extraordinary. It's all because of either greed or politics - Canadian politics.": "Simon",
  "The first thing I've learned is to trust nobody.": "Josh",
  "It takes years for me to trust; I know that about myself. A lot of it is because I am so private, and so reluctant to make myself vulnerable.": "Michelle",
  "Trust me, the only real way to understand 'Chic' is in highfalutin terms. Our chord progressions were based on European modal melodies. I made those early 'Chic' records to impress my jazz friends.": "Nile",

  "In the 1960s, if you introduced a new product to America, 90% of the people who viewed it for the first time believed in the corporate promise. Then 40 years later if you performed the same exercise, less than 10% of the public believed it was true. The fracturing of trust is based on the fact that the consumer has been let down.": "Howard",

  "Have a goal. Know where you want to end up. Knowing where you want to end up is a lot easier than figuring out how to start and how to get there. You will figure out how to get there. Do not chart your career. Trust me you do not want to chart your career. ": "Gary",
  "There is a clear goal and it isn't to make money. The goal is to desperately try to make the best products we can. We are not naive - if you trust it, people like it, they buy it and we make money. This is a consequence.": "Jonathan",

  "Don't ever break someone's trust. Once you do, then nobody wants to do business with you.": "Robert",
  "I don't think I have ever taken any 'offbeat' advice. Actually, I don't know I take any advice very often. I trust my own instincts and seek out information so I can make fully informed decisions. That's what's worked for me.": "Diane",
  "Don't trust everyone, especially if they say, 'Trust me.'": "Michelle",
  "The violations of these diesel motors by our company go against everything that Volkswagen stands for... at this time, I don't yet have the answers to all the questions.

  "Profitability, growth, and safeguards against existential risks are crucial to strengthening a company's long-term prospects. But if these three factors constitute a company's 'hard power,' firms also need 'soft power': public trust and acceptance, won by fulfilling a company's social responsibility.": "Klaus",
  "I hope with all my heart and soul that every young man who receives the priesthood will honor that priesthood and be true to the trust which is conveyed when it is conferred. May each of us who holds the priesthood of God know what he believes.": "Thomas",

  "A lot of why I climb is for the friendship, the loyalty and trust, the shared experience of being in that moment.": "Jimmy",
  "I think there's no question that vaccines have been absolutely critical in ridding us of the scourge of many diseases - smallpox, polio, etc. So vaccines are an invaluable medication. Like any medication, they also should be - what shall we say? - approved by a regulatory board that people can trust.": "Jill",
  "Be as transparent as you can in your trade. The big thing in life is trust.": "T.",
  "Too many guys don't know what to do with their lives after boxing. I was lucky because I had two managers who didn't trust each other, and so they were always making sure where all the money was, and because of that, so did I.": "Gerry",
  "I trust if your life is right, the right things will happen at the right time. If the chords are in harmony inside, I think other things will happen in the same way. That sounded highfalutin' to me once, but I believe it now.": "Gene",
  "My mother had taught shorthand and typing to support us since my father died, and secretly she hated it and hated him for dying and leaving no money because he didn't trust life insurance salesmen.": "Sylvia",

  "When I went to the prosecutor's office, I wanted to be one of the good guys that the defense could trust. I'd try fair, clean cases, pull no punches, no below-the-belt stuff. Honorable. Because that's the kind of prosecutor I wanted to deal with.": "Marcia",
  "I am a small business owner I'm in the agri-business. That's about as blind a trust as you can get. We trust in the Lord for rain and many other things. ": "Sonny",

  "I love to see lack of clarity in a performance as well as clarity, as well as trust, as well as the kinds of things that human beings go through. I love to see spontaneity and 'inevitability.' How it gets there is going to shock the hell out of me, but it will get there somehow.": "Martin",
  "In an increasingly polarized world, it's hard to know whom to trust. CNN will be the only news channel that doesn't take a side.": "Jeff",
  "Just because somebody says you are not trustworthy, that doesn't mean it is so... CNN's brand equity is built over 37 years doing hard work in very dangerous places... those who rely on CNN trust CNN more than ever.": "Jeff",

  "As contagion of sickness makes sickness, contagion of trust can make trust.": "Marianne",
  "Trust your gut instinct over spreadsheets. There are too many variables in the real world that you simply can't put into a spreadsheet.

  "I love that we can trust Barack to do what he says he's going to do, even when it's hard - especially when it's hard.": "Michelle",
  "I buy about $1,500 worth of papers every month. Not that I trust them. I'm looking for the crack in the fabric.": "Dick",
  "Pakistanis can't trust. They've seen in history that people, particularly politicians, are corrupt. And they're misguided by people in the name of Islam. They're told: 'Malala is not a Muslim, she's not in purdah, she's working for America.'": "Malala",
  "The way you build trust with your people is by being forthright and clear with them from day one. You may think people are fooled when you tell them what they want to hear. They are not fooled.": "Dick",

  "Things that have happened with Enron and companies like that, where they've squandered their employees' pension funds, I think it has brought a new level of anxiety. People don't feel like they can trust their employer.": "Mike",
  "We must never take the public's trust for granted - our predecessors worked hard to earn it, and it is our responsibility to continually earn that trust.": "Sally",
  "Prenups are so unromantic - a sign of distrust, not love. Time for a reality check, my friends. First, drawing up a prenuptial agreement together is a sign of incredible trust and financial openness - you're fooling yourself if you think you can achieve complete intimacy without it.": "Suze",
  "I think women have an innate ability to be intuitive with people that they truly love, but they have to trust that inner voice, and I think it is there. I think we are more intuitive than men.": "Andie",
  "I'm so suspicious of boys-slash-men. I just don't like them or trust them.": "Megan",
  "People have to render judgment. In my case, I've said upfront openly, I've made mistakes at times. I've had to go to God for forgiveness. I've had to seek reconciliation. But I'm also a 68-year-old grandfather, and I think people have to measure who I am now and whether I'm a person they can trust.": "Newt",
  "David Ben-Gurion understood that the public's trust is given to a leader in order to lead, determine clear goals and make difficult decisions. The fate of the people and the good of the state guided him, not polls, media treatment or measures of prestige.": "Ariel",
  "I trust work, directors - I don't live in fear. All good experiences have come from trusting the universe. There is no other way to live or love. Otherwise, you create your own prison.": "Olivia",
  "There are a lot of times that we feel like our hands are tied - 'I have no control over if I'm going to lose my job.' 'I have no control over if I'm going to be able to pay my bills.' You've got to realize that that's where your trust comes in. You have to trust God, and keep your hope, because your hope is what produces your faith.": "Victoria",
  "I don't want the United States to be in a global economy where our economic future is bound to that of Zimbabwe. We can't necessarily trust the decisions that are being made financially in other countries.": "Michele",
  "Throughout history, when societies face tough economic times, we have seen democratic reforms deferred, decreased trust in government, persecution of minority groups, and a general shrinking of the democratic space.": "Samantha",
  "Treachery has existed as long as there's been warfare, and there's always been a few people that you couldn't trust.": "James",
  "Now the first step has to be taken, the step towards democracy. This step is full of risks, and requires trust on all sides. We don't know where it will lead. But if we just stand still, we will have no chance of escaping the violence.": "Daniel",
  "In an ecology of love, people can relate in trust and face the future without fear. They do not need to play it safe. They can take uncertainty in their stride.": "Jonathan",
  "All in all, I just don't trust journalists - and I don't think it's a good practice for me to trust journalists.": "Frank",
  "The sadness of the women's movement is that they don't allow the necessity of love. See, I don't personally trust any revolution where love is not allowed.": "Maya",

  "The 'public' scares me, but people I trust.": "Marilyn",
  "I have learned from personal experience that putting trust in God means there will be some unanswered questions. That was a hard lesson for me because I naturally want to understand everything... to know what's going on so I can feel like I'm in control.": "Joyce",

  "Like everybody else, I've had relationships in which I was passionately in love but was completely miserable all the time and didn't trust the person I was in love with one inch.": "Salman",
  "I was an awful critic. I operated on the assumption that there was an absolute scale of values against which art could be measured. I didn't trust my own subjective responses.": "Tom",

  "It is better to suffer wrong than to do it, and happier to be sometimes cheated than not to trust.": "Samuel",
  "A newspaper is a public trust, and we will suffer as a society without them. It is not the Internet that has killed them. It is their own greed, it is their own stupidity, and it is capitalism that has taken our daily newspapers from us.": "Michael",

  "I trust myself. You need that to survive.": "Yoko",
  "Public trust in both government and corporations is low, and deservedly so.": "Rebecca",
  "I go to movies expecting to have a whole experience. If I want a movie that doesn't end, I'll go to a French movie. That's a betrayal of trust to me. A movie has to be complete within itself; it can't just build off the first one or play variations.": "Joss",
  "I periodically realize every few years that the only person whose taste I really trust is me.": "Brian",
  "I trust my taste. I trust it completely and I always have done, and I've always thought it isn't that different from everybody else's.": "Brian",

  "My working and personal relationship with President Obama is marked by growing trust. I appreciate this.": "Vladimir",
  "The single best machine to measure trust is a human being. We haven't figured out a metric that works better than our own sort of, like, 'There's something fishy about you.'": "Simon",

  "The amount of trust and bandwidth that you build up working with someone for five, seven, 10 years? It's just awesome. I care about openness and connectedness in a global sense.": "Mark",
  "The entire process of making a movie is sort of blind trust because, otherwise, all of it just doesn't make any sense: the fact that we can create any sense of reality or emotion given the arbitrariness of a day.": "Brie",

  "I think of Paul Feig as the Scorsese of comedy. He's the best at what he does. I think people just trust everything that he's got to say.": "Jason",
  "If someone lies, well, you had a choice to trust that person or not. I think the way my father raised me, well, he trusted everybody. And that worked for him.": "Tom",
  "The downside to making movies at a gallop like we did with 'Wish You Were Here' is that we're shooting four or five scenes in a day, and it's very exhilarating, but you worry at the end of the day that you missed some details because you were moving too quick, and you just gotta trust and be ready straightaway.": "Joel",
  "Let me say this: I'm paranoid of the government. They've lost my trust. They've lied to me so many times that I don't know what to believe from them anymore.": "Jesse",

  "No one has proof that I know of, that a higher power exists, yet a major portion of the world believes in it and relies on it in faith in trust, in what that is. Where is the science in that? And yet you have incredible belief in that.": "Sandra",
  "It's time to stop the raid on the Social Security trust fund and start allowing Americans to invest their Social Security taxes in personal savings accounts.": "Mike",
  "When we started the e-commerce, nobody believed that China would have e-commerce because people believed in 'guang-shi,' face-to-face, and all kinds of network in traditional ways. There's no trust system in China.": "Jack",

  "When I make a movie, I don't break it down and analyze it. I could but it would get in the way of doing a job - on instinct based on all the research we did going in. you want to trust yourself and your director and your acting partners in the circumstances you're shooting. I don't like to have any kind of overview.": "Viggo",
  "Gerard doesn't tell me what to do. We discuss everything as a couple, as I imagine most partners do. We have a beautiful relationship and one of mutual trust.": "Shakira",

  "Snowden grants that NSA employees by and large believe in their mission and trust the agency to handle the secrets it takes from ordinary people - deliberately, in the case of bulk records collection, and 'incidentally,' when the content of American phone calls and e-mails are swept into NSA systems along with foreign targets.": "Barton",
  "You can't trust an artist that just makes good records.": "Nick",

  "Linux is a complex example of the wisdom of crowds. It's a good example in the sense that it shows you can set people to work in a decentralized way - that is, without anyone really directing their efforts in a particular direction - and still trust that they're going to come up with good answers.": "James",
  "The challenge for capitalism is that the things that breed trust also breed the environment for fraud.": "James",
  "Unlike most government programs, Social Security and, in part, Medicare are funded by payroll taxes dedicated specifically to them.

  "What we're doing now is we're saying that individual schools can spend the money on their own priorities, so that head teachers can decide what's truly important, because the big shift in approach on education that we're taking - which is different from what happened before - is that we trust teachers and we trust heads.": "Michael",

  "Back in the '90s, folks were not sure if they could trust the Web, and frankly, a lot of the services back then didn't provide massive value.": "Jason",
  "For somehow this disease inheres in tyranny, never to trust one's friends.": "Aeschylus",
  "I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment. American actors are much better at that than British actors. If I knew how to trust myself, I would have been much more relaxed.": "Hugh",
  "I'm a terrible actor. I'm still learning. When I first started, I wish I knew then to trust myself more, really. I was in a terrible panic in the early part of my career.": "Hugh",
  "I used to pre-rehearse everything and then bring my pre-rehearsed performance to the set. Now, I'm learning to let it happen in the moment. American actors are much better at that than British actors. If I knew how to trust myself, I would have been much more relaxed. Maybe I would have less gray hairs today.": "Hugh",
  "In many ways, it was much, much harder to get the first book contract. The hardest thing probably overall has been learning not to trust people, publicists and so forth, implicitly.": "Neil",
  "I know it sounds new age-y, but what I've truly come up with is that you really need to trust that you're on your own path, as long as you stay true to it and you show up, which is 99% of it.": "Jane",
  "Employers, like most people, tend to trust their intuitions. But when employers decide whom to hire, they trust those intuitions far more than they should.": "Cass",
  "I trust and use RakEM for my private messages and calls. Other messengers collected metadata about who I messaged, when and where - RakEM does not collect metadata, encrypts local files, and uses the strongest end-to-end encryption around.": "John",
  "I was one of the first practitioners of social engineering as a hacking technique, and today it is my only tool of use, aside from a smartphone - in a purely white hat sort of way. But if you don't trust me, then ask any reasonably competent social engineer.": "John",
  "I don't know... I don't think you can trust any of Kurt's characters. That's how Mr. Sutter operates: nothing is what it seems.": "Jimmy",
  "I don't trust anybody that doesn't do good work. I don't give them any credibility. If they can't write, why should I believe anything they have to say?": "Jim",
  "If you're reading IMDB, half of it's made up. You can't trust it or Wikipedia, which is just lies, lies!": "Julianne",
  "Cyberbullying isn't real. But bullying and harassment certainly are real. Trust me, friends, I went to school in England. They've got bullying down to a fine art. I know, because I was one of its chief architects. I was awful to my fellow schoolboys.": "Milo",
  "Every time I make American film I just trust American directors and American writers.": "Jackie",
  "I trust that McDonald's can find a way to sell all-natural chicken without raising their prices; we did that at Shake Shack. It is more expensive, and we took a slight margin hit, but we did it. And if we can do it, I know that much bigger companies can.": "Danny",
  "Actors need to trust themselves. If you trust yourself, you can trust others and leave the director outside.": "Martin",
  "I'd rather trust nine people and have the 10th one stab me in the back. I'd take that fall in order to have those nine friendships or working relationships instead of having none. That's not living.": "Margot",
  "I feel like the majority of the fear that I had or that we have we hold from other people. They're like people that we trust they're their fears. All of a sudden we think that they're our fears. ": "Alicia",
  "To get a child's trust - you may know or not - is a very hard thing to do. They're so used to not believing adults - because adults tell tales and lies all the time.": "Maurice",
  "Newspapers with declining circulations can complain all they want about their readers and even say they have no taste. But you will still go out of business over time. A newspaper is not a public trust - it has a business model that either works or it doesn't.": "Marc",
  "I think that winning creates chemistry, as opposed to other way around. I've been on a lot of friendly teams that couldn't win, trust me.": "Joe",
  "The poker player learns that sometimes both science and common sense are wrong; that the bumblebee can fly; that, perhaps, one should never trust an expert; that there are more things in Heaven and Earth than are dreamt of by those with an academic bent.": "David",

  "You wouldn't want to be in a rock band - trust me.": "Jenny",
  "At the end of the day, you're handing your performance over. If a director says after a take, 'You know what, try it just really angry. Just get furious'... you're like, 'Well, I don't know if I want to give you that because I don't know if I trust what you're going to do with it.'": "Chris",
  "I guess as long as people think of me for different ages, I'll trust their opinion. I remember noticing one year that Michelle Monaghan played 34 and 19, so I've kind of clung to that as my justification that I can be Jake Gyllenhaal's wife and a freshman in college in the same year.": "Anna",
  "I was good at being a doctor my patients liked me. At times people trust you with things they wouldn't tell their spouses. It was a real privilege. ": "Khaled",
  "For me, the director is the most important thing. He is steering the boat. If you don't trust him, you won't be able to give him your all.": "Michelle",
  "Being vulnerable is allowing yourself to trust. That's hard for a lot of people to do. They feel a lot more secure if they kind of put walls around themselves. Then they don't have to trust anybody but themselves.": "Herbie",
  "I don't see how we can have both the freedoms we had before and the safety net that we all need considering the way the world is today. And that's just because human beings can't trust each other. We've given in over and over to some of the darkest elements that exist in life itself.": "Herbie",

  "It's in the DNA of Scientology that they don't trust journalists.": "Louis",
  "Big game hunters and the hunting industry in South Africa know a lot of people regard what they do as terrible, and the media have tended not to do them any favours. So it was an uphill struggle to win trust from the people and to get into the world.": "Louis",
  "Direct talks is the only possible way to build trust and to resolve the conditions for a peace perspective between Palestinians and Israelis.": "Reuven",

  "The closer you are to technology, the more you trust it.": "Steve",
  "As an actor, I trust my ear.": "Christopher",
  "When the players go home, I can't tell them what to do, so you need to create an atmosphere of trust. I don't want to think, 'What are they doing now? Do I need to call them?'": "Jurgen",

  "Trust me: our critical infrastructure is vulnerable to cyber-attack, to potential terrorist attack, and we are not taking this threat seriously enough.": "Ron",
  "When you find fame, or you get signed to a record label, it's not what you imagined - because you imagined they would have 100 percent trust or faith in you as an artist. Unfortunately, that's not really the case - it's what sells.": "James",

  "If I feel insecure, then I am in the wrong profession. I have to trust my director and the material he has given me.": "Arjun",
  "An actor should never be influenced by the surroundings, because you have to submit completely, and trust me, it's not a good feeling when you know that your father is going to come and watch you work every day!": "Arjun",

  "How do you trust a government whose people are proved to be untrustworthy?": "Kapil",

  "I force people to have coffee with me, just because I don't trust that a friendship can be maintained without any other senses besides a computer or cellphone screen.": "John",
  "America's a faith-based experiment as a country. We should celebrate and invite faith. And our motto is, 'In God We Trust.' This isn't something that divides; this is something that pulls together and lifts us up.": "Sam",

  "In the long run, we will need many more African-American, Latino, and Native American leaders, and leaders from low-income communities, who can bring additional insight and a deeply grounded sense of urgency, and who are the most likely to inspire the necessary trust and engagement among students' parents and community leaders.": "Wendy",
  "During the Arab Spring, I learned all sorts of things from Twitter. I wouldn't necessarily trust that information, but it gave me ideas about questions to ask. You can really learn things from the wisdom of crowds.": "Nicholas",
  "I never felt, 'Oh, I think I look good.' I always tend to be more in the insecure side. And I thought that has always been a way to protect myself. Because I don't trust the good feelings that can come from that.": "Penelope",
  "Don't forget: when you start a website, it's not yet a trusted site. So you have to bring people from a trusted site to your site to build up the trust in your site.": "James",

  "I'm going to trust my instincts when something's wrong.": "Katarina",
  "Russia would prefer to rebuild trust rather than allow it to further corrode. That's why, in July 2007, President Putin, in the spirit of strategic openness, proposed a truly collective effort at missile defense for Europe.": "Sergei",
  "Over these years, I have irrevocably transferred a significant part of the shareholding in Wipro, amounting to 39% of the shares of Wipro, to a trust.": "Azim",
  "There is an intimacy and trust that is needed between leaders, between their assistants and advisers. Usually, you have the real substance behind closed doors; and the press conferences, you have niceties, nice photo ops.": "Tzipi",

  "Amazon is a corporation, not a philanthropic trust dedicated to the production of works of art and literature.": "Nick",
  "I trust myself, the way I prepare. I feel like I know what I'm doing.": "Lizzie",
  "The right rules of engagement means giving our forward commanders the authority and flexibility to take the initiative and win. Trust our forward deployed warriors to do their job. Political appointees running the war from Washington is just wrong.": "Ryan",
  "I've served in 25 nations. I've seen where people don't trust their government. We're there. In the military, the last option is to send in the SEALs.": "Ryan",
  "Salman is genuinely a nice man who helps people. He is someone who I trust blindly. I think he has been an important person in my life.": "Jacqueline",
  "You've just got to trust your instincts and realize that you can't please all the people all the time. You've got to please yourself ultimately in the end.": "Noel",
  "When I was teaching Latin in girls' schools before I became a writer, I didn't much like it if parents would come in and say, 'We'll have less of the Ovid and Virgil and more of the grammar, please.' After all, I was the one in charge. That's how I feel about doctors. You should trust them to do their job properly.": "Maeve",
  "If you're ruling the world, you can't trust anybody. Because even those who profess to be working in your interest - those are also villains in and of their own right.": "Mark",

  "It's hard finding people you trust or who aren't going to take your money. Everyone wants to get a piece of whatever you're doing. It's a nightmare.": "Cara",
  "I just don't think that I trust men. That's the problem. I can appreciate a beautiful-looking man, but he's not my type.": "Cara",
  "You do need some dispensation for local farmers, because the fast food industry will promote the unsanitary conditions of farming. With vegetables, you have to be careful where they come from; you have to know the farmers and trust them. If you buy from the farmers' market, it's already been investigated.": "Alice",

  "Assad has to be removed, and then you have to actually put someone in that is a qualified leader that can start to build some trust in that area.": "James",

  "For the outside world, it may seem easy to enter into the industry if you belong to a film family, but, trust me, it's even harder, as you have to not only prove your talent but also carve your own niche and identity.": "Armaan",
  "Individual people shouldn't be fearful, because by and large our government, the federal government - people always talk; obviously, they don't trust the feds, whatever. The federal government and local communities have done a pretty good job at keeping us safe.": "Sherrod",
  "It is important not to trust people too much.": "V.",
  "To be honest, the fact that people trust you gives you a lot of power over people. Having another person's trust is more powerful than all other management techniques put together.": "Linus",
  "I always have issues with trust. I'm a New Yorker... Really, I think trust is something that comes from the gut. And I think you have to - it's probably the worst advice to give people - but I think you gotta trust people from your gut.": "Vin",
  "We believe that what we possess we don't ultimately own. God is merely entrusting it to us. And one of the conditions of that trust is that we share what we have with those who have less. So, if you don't give to people in need, you can hardly call yourself a Jew. Even the most unbelieving Jew knows that.": "Jonathan",
  "That no government, so called, can reasonably be trusted, or reasonably be supposed to have honest purposes in view, any longer than it depends wholly upon voluntary support.": "Lysander",
  "I think, in terms of activism associated with my films, be it 'Salaam Baalak Trust' or 'Maisha,' taking the idea of cinema as a way to change people, I feel heartened. I am glad that we have impacted thousands of lives.": "Mira",

  "When you're in the heat of the moment, you need guys you can trust and who have been there for you.": "Bradley",
  "They still have negligent auditing, they still have things going for a walk, and they have no idea where they're coming from, and they have no idea where they're going. And if that's the case, how can we, as the public, trust the NSA with all of our information, with all of our private records, the permanent record of our lives?": "Edward",
  "I have an accountant, obviously, because I'm self employed, and I use an independent financial adviser. I trust my accountant because we have worked together for a long time now.": "Richard",

  "I trust every single person around me, and if I feel even a whiff of uncertainty I won't have that person around me.": "Leona",
  "Now, I learned soon enough, that among the three, two don't trust the third one - the third one is the government. Both industry and unions feel the government is a talking organization and a spending organization.": "Shimon",

  "Ethics reform is about restoring the public trust. When that is in doubt, nothing is more important than restoring it.": "Ken",
  "There's not a lot of time to have conversations on the field during the game. That's where the trust and the practice comes into play, through practice, through off-site throwing sessions; that's where you build that trust and build that cohesion with a wide receiver.": "Brock",
  "Trust your instincts: they tend to see you right. By listening to them, at least you can sleep at night.": "Sophie",
  "For Mr. Elway to take me in the second round and show that trust that he has in me and the upside he thinks I have, I want to go out and there and prove him right. I want to be able to have him look back 10 years from now, 15 years from now, and have him be very proud about that selection and let him know that he did make the right selection.": "Brock",
  "Republicans would have preferred the court overturn the health care bill, an act that would have underscored Obama's biggest liability - the perception among voters, including those who like and trust him, that he has been ineffective.": "Ron",
  "Actually, I never work in movies for money. I'm glad when I get well-paid, but it's not always the case - trust me.": "Vincent",
  "A government that can take all and can seize all, a government that doesn't trust its citizens, a government that says it's their way or the highway... that's the scary part.": "Paul",

  "You have to trust your kids. They have to experience life, and you just hope you've provided them a foundation for what's right and what isn't.": "Jack",
  "I do not understand where the backing of Bitcoin is coming from. There is no fundamental issue of capabilities of repaying it in anything which is universally acceptable, which is either intrinsic value of the currency or the credit or trust of the individual who is issuing the money, whether it's a government or an individual.": "Alan",
  "Trust your ability!": "Itzhak",

  "I think about trust and confidence as something that you earn every day, and we will keep at it, earning it every day.": "Lynn",
  "Most companies that go through layoffs are never the same. They don't recover because trust is broken. And if you're not honest at the point where you're breaking trust anyway, you will never recover.": "Ben",
  "When you're surrounded by all these people, it can be even lonelier than when you're by yourself. You can be in a huge crowd, but if you don't feel like you can trust anybody or talk to anybody, you feel like you're really alone.": "Fiona",
  "It's definitely team work with my fashion career. The trick is to surround yourself with the best people, those whose opinions you really trust and value.": "Suki",

  "I would say that as I've gotten older, I trust my intuition more; I allow myself more freedom both musically, creatively and my own life existentially.": "Matisyahu",
  "While eschewing emotion - and its companion, vulnerability - Obama should be careful not to sacrifice empathy, the 'I feel your pain' connection that sustained Clinton. This connection is the shorthand people use to measure their leaders' intentions. If people believe you're on their side, they will trust your decisions.": "Dee",

  "It is really hard when you spend your life living out of a suitcase. But it really does weed out superficial people - if someone is still with you after the second movie, then they're probably a good one! I like to trust people in general - it's the southern girl in me.": "Amber",

  "I think I still have a great sense of adventure and trust, and am surprisingly idealistic given all the horrible things I've seen since I was 25. I think how I have changed is that I have a much deeper understanding of the dark forces in the world, of power.": "Jacqueline",
  "When you're CEO, you have to have two conditions: first, shareholders need to trust you and want you to head your company. The second is that you need to feel the motivation to do the job. So, as long as both are reunited, you continue to do the job.": "Carlos",
  "When you're C.E.O., you have to have two conditions: first, shareholders need to trust you and want you to head your company. The second is that you need to feel the motivation to do the job. So, as long as both are reunited, you continue to do the job. And today, they are reunited.": "Carlos",
  "People shouldn't trust artists and they shouldn't trust art. Part of the fun of art is that it invites you to interpret it.": "Tony",
  "'Orphan Black' allows for people to have debates and theories and allegiances to different characters - to trust characters and hate other characters - but it doesn't tell you who is good or bad or right or wrong. That's the most exciting storytelling, in my book.": "Tatiana",

  "Our form of government depends on a mutual bond of trust between the people and their government. But people have become cynical about their government.": "Sonny",
  "Changing much-cherished bank secrecy laws is worth the effort. Corruption, tax evasion, and the capture of natural resource revenues undermine the rule of law, weaken the social fabric, erode citizens' trust in institutions, fuel conflict and insecurity, and hamper job creation.": "Sri",

  "Love and trust and justice, concern for the poor, that's being pushed to the margins, and you can see it.": "Cornel",
  "Writing a novel is a huge adventure; when it's going well it's more fun than fun. When it stutters to a halt put it aside. Go for a swim, go for a walk, take a week off. Don't panic or be afraid; you and your characters are in it together. Trust them to come to your rescue.": "Deborah",
  "No one has got close enough to use or abuse me, and even if they did, I wouldn't get too emotional about it. The only thing I ever get emotional about is my family. I am kind to everyone but I trust no one. That keeps me from getting hurt.": "Akshay",
  "Trust me, if I were gay I'd be getting more action than I'm getting now.": "Ryan",

  "Trust me, I play the game for the fans, my family and myself.": "David",
  "All I can hope to do is instill great morality in my son and trust him along the way. The music he listens to or how he chooses to wear his hair doesn't define his moral compass, and if he wants to listen to country music and wear a cowboy hat too, that's fine.": "Mark",
  "The Lord God carries us throughout our lives just as a father carries his child. The Lord carried me, and He still is. He made you. He knows what you're good at. He knows what you can do and what you can become. Trust Him. Love Him. He'll always love you back.": "Frank",

  "Jealousy, that dragon which slays love under the pretence of keeping it alive.": "Havelock",
  "We are becoming able to see the pursuit of external power for what it is and the futility of trying to escape the pain of powerlessness by changing the world.

  "Show me your garden and I shall tell you what you are.": "Alfred",
  "There's something about taking a plow and breaking new ground. It gives you energy.": "Ken",
  "A garden is a complex of aesthetic and plastic intentions; and the plant is, to a landscape artist, not only a plant - rare, unusual, ordinary or doomed to disappearance - but it is also a color, a shape, a volume or an arabesque in itself.": "Roberto",

  "The earth is rocky and full of roots; it's clay, and it seems doomed and polluted, but you dig little holes for the ugly shriveled bulbs, throw in a handful of poppy seeds, and cover it all over, and you know you'll never see it again - it's death and clay and shrivel, and your hands are nicked from the rocks, your nails black with soil.": "Anne",

  "In the world at large, people are rewarded or punished in ways that are often utterly random. In the garden, cause and effect, labor and reward, are re-coupled. Gardening makes sense in a senseless world. By extension, then, the more gardens in the world, the more justice, the more sense is created.": "Andrew",
  "One of the least arduous but most productive of gardening jobs, the magic of deadheading never fails to delight me. It was a revelation when the principle was explained to me: that flowers are the attempt by the plant to reproduce itself. So if you cut the heads off before the flower turns into seeds, the plant will continue to flower.": "Tom",
  "Gardening always has been an art, essentially.": "Robert",
  "Clarity is the most important thing. I can compare clarity to pruning in gardening. You know, you need to be clear. If you are not clear, nothing is going to happen. You have to be clear.

  "I've come to recognize what I call my 'inside interests.' Telling stories. And helping people tell their stories is a sort of interpersonal gardening.

  "To dwell is to garden.": "Martin",
  "Every time I imagine a garden in an architectural setting, it turns into a magical place. I think of gardens I have seen, that I believe I have seen, that I long to see, surrounded by simple walls, columns, arcades or the facades of buildings - sheltered places of great intimacy where I want to stay for a long time.": "Peter",
  "Gardening is not a rational act.": "Margaret",

  "The cottage garden; most for use designed, Yet not of beauty destitute.": "Charlotte",
  "My passion for gardening may strike some as selfish, or merely an act of resignation in the face of overwhelming problems that beset the world. It is neither. I have found that each garden is just what Voltaire proposed in Candide: a microcosm of a just and beautiful society.": "Andrew",
  "Overall, the anarchy was the most creative of all periods of Japanese culture for in it there appeared the greatest landscape painting, the culmination of the skill of landscape gardening and the arts of flower arrangement, and the No drama.": "J.",
  "I could happily lean on a gate all the livelong day, chatting to passers-by about the wind and the rain. I do a lot of gate-leaning while I am supposed to be gardening; instead of hoeing, I lean on the gate, stare at the vegetable beds and ponder.": "Tom",

  "I like to encourage people interested in gardening or planting to begin with a simple herb garden. Even if you live in a small apartment, you can have some herb pots.": "Anna",
  "I'm pretty good at gardening. It consumes my time, and it feels like I'm doing something constructive.": "Simon",
  "Very early, I thought I would go into music, but I was aware that it would bring a set of obstacles I didn't find particularly attractive. Also, I'm not a great performer! For a while, I thought I would do something in landscape gardening. But it was always fashion for me.": "Stella",

  "Cooking, decorating, diet/self-help and gardening books are guilty pleasures and useful time fillers.": "Hillary",

  "I came to London. I spent nine months doing domestic work and gardening because I knew I wanted to get a West End show. So, when I was offered jobs in Stoke or Leicester or whatever, I'd say no. Eventually, I got 'Godspell.' It was gently building.": "Jeremy",

  "The profession I have keeps dragging me into drama and taking me away from baking, flowering and gardening.": "Lykke",
  "I don't see my artist friends as any more neurotic or addiction-prone than the others. The roommates I have had who were into triathlons or environmentalism were just as crazy as the poets, just as prone to tears over gardening or air conditioners, just as ready to kite a cheque or binge on cookie dough.": "Russell",
  "I've never really understood the criticism that climbing is inherently selfish, since it could equally be argued about virtually any other hobby or sport. Is gardening selfish?": "Alex",

  "At home, I relax by gardening, or just pottering.": "Jennifer",
  "I adore gardening and plan to take it up properly when I have a bit more time on my hands. Until then, I love pottering in garden centres. I'm totally low maintenance. I don't ask for fancy plants, just basic, long-lasting shrubs that look nice. But I am particular about flowers.": "Shilpa",

  "When I go into the garden, I forget everything. It's uncomplicated in my world of gardening. It's trial and error, really. If something doesn't work, it comes out, and you start all over again.": "Emilia",
  "When a finished work of 20th century sculpture is placed in an 18th century garden, it is absorbed by the ideal representation of the past, thus reinforcing political and social values that are no longer with us.": "Robert",

  "Well tended garden is better than a neglected wood lot.": "Dixie",
  "It's my observation that gardeners and gardening for a very long time have had to take a back seat. Architects are very famous they've got huge projects. What goes on in and around them has been relegated to a very minor role. ": "Robert",

  "I am so longing to be domestic,, cooking stew, gardening, hopefully having some children, painting, sitting still in one place.": "Eve",
  "In many ways, theatre is more rewarding for a writer. I used to think it was like painting a wall - that when the play is finished, it's done - but now I realise it's more like gardening; you plant the thing, then you have to constantly tend it. You're part of a thing that's living.": "Lee",

  "The Herbs ought to be distilled when they are in their greatest vigor, and so ought the Flowers also.": "Nicholas",
  "There's something about beautiful moments in sports that alters our experience of time. And I'd say the same thing about poetry and gardening. Gardening slows me down. I want to stop and observe everything.": "Ross",
  "No one will understand a Japanese garden until you've walked through one, and you hear the crunch underfoot, and you smell it, and you experience it over time. Now there's no photograph or any movie that can give you that experience.": "J.",
  "The English may love gardening and fishing, but they have never struck me as being close to nature. Their way of expression is 'the hollyhocks are awfully good' sort of thing, all done in very good taste. The savagery of nature is something they don't dwell upon.": "Denholm",
  "I cannot remember a time when I was not interested in both gardening and painting. I must have been born with a trowel in one hand and a paintbrush in the other.": "Emma",
  "Because I am really interested in gardening, I do really interesting plants, not even always flowers. And because I have grown them, I really know them like friends. I paint everything from exotic orchids to rosehips growing wild in a hedge. They just have to speak to me.": "Emma",
  "I enjoy painting, cutting the lawn and working in the garden when I have time. That's therapy for me. I enjoy working with my hands.": "Billy",

  "The beauty of a woman is not in a facial mode but the true beauty in a woman is reflected in her soul. It is the caring that she lovingly gives the passion that she shows. The beauty of a woman grows with the passing years.": "Audrey",
  "Consider a tree for a moment. As beautiful as trees are to look at, we don't see what goes on underground - as they grow roots. Trees must develop deep roots in order to grow strong and produce their beauty. But we don't see the roots. We just see and enjoy the beauty. In much the same way, what goes on inside of us is like the roots of a tree.": "Joyce",
  "Makeup is not a mask that covers up your beauty it's a weapon that helps you express who you are from the inside. ": "Michelle",

  "Beauty is not just a white girl. It's so many different flavors and shades.": "Queen",
  "The beauty of a woman is not in the clothes she wears, the figure that she carries or the way she combs her hair.": "Audrey",
  "Don't get me wrong, I admire elegance and have an appreciation of the finer things in life. But to me, beauty lies in simplicity.": "Mark",

  "My belief is that we were put into this world of wonders and beauty with a special ability to appreciate them, in some cases to have the fun of taking a hand in developing them, and also in being able to help other people instead of overreaching them and, through it all, to enjoy life - that is, to be happy.": "Robert",

  "Walk on a rainbow trail; walk on a trail of song, and all about you will be beauty. There is a way out of every dark mist, over a rainbow trail.": "Robert",
  "Beauty is about perception, not about make-up. I think the beginning of all beauty is knowing and liking oneself. You can't put on make-up, or dress yourself, or do you hair with any sort of fun or joy if you're doing it from a position of correction.": "Kevyn",
  "There's a difference between beauty and charm. A beautiful woman is one I notice. A charming woman is one who notices me.": "John",
  "Beauty is a short-lived tyranny.": "Socrates",

  "Beauty in things exists in the mind which contemplates them.": "David",

  "The beauty of Maine is such that you can't really see it clearly while you live there.

  "If you drive to, say, Shenandoah National Park, or the Great Smoky Mountains, you'll get some appreciation for the scale and beauty of the outdoors. When you walk into it, then you see it in a completely different way. You discover it in a much slower, more majestic sort of way.": "Bill",
  "My father, who was a cabinetmaker, told me, 'Wood has a grain and if you go into the grain, you have beauty. If you go against it, you have splinters - it breaks.' And I took that as my view of life. You have to follow the grain - to be sensitive to the direction of life.": "Christian",
  "Beauty arises out of human inspiration.": "Richard",
  "The beauty of a finely worked object points to the beauty of the craftsmanship. The beauty of the craftsmanship points to the beauty of the name which was the source of the craftsmanship.

  "I am a thing of beauty.": "Frank",
  "It is shallow people who think beauty is frivolous or excessive. If you are bringing beauty and god, you are enriching the country. Rice feeds the body, books feed the mind, beauty feeds the soul. It is one thing I can really be proud of and stand tall in the world.": "Imelda",
  "Really, at the end of the day, the only thing you can control is yourself; the only person you can truly educate is yourself. You have to redefine what beauty is to you so you can't be affected by what people are saying.": "Rupi",
  "A few years ago I lost 30 pounds, and people still wanted to criticize. And honestly, I'm happy with myself if I'm a little heavier. I realized: 'Why am I trying to conform to someone else's idea of beauty?' I think I'm beautiful either way.": "Khloe",
  "Beauty is ever to the lonely mind a shadow fleeting; she is never plain. She is a visitor who leaves behind the gift of grief, the souvenir of pain.": "Christopher",

  "Wisdom is the abstract of the past, but beauty is the promise of the future.": "Oliver",
  "The coniferous forests of the Yosemite Park, and of the Sierra in general, surpass all others of their kind in America, or indeed the world, not only in the size and beauty of the trees, but in the number of species assembled together, and the grandeur of the mountains they are growing on.": "John",

  "We Orientals find beauty not only in the thing itself but in the pattern of the shadows, the light and darkness which that thing provides.": "Junichiro",
  "But the gravest difficulty, and perhaps the most important, in poetry meant solely for recitation, is the difficulty of achieving verbal beauty, or rather of making verbal beauty tell.": "Lascelles",
  "Beauty does not linger; it only visits. Yet beauty's visitation affects us and invites us into its rhythm; it calls us to feel, think and act beautifully in the world: to create and live a life that awakens the Beautiful. A life without delight is only half a life.": "John",

  "Pastry is different from cooking because you have to consider the chemistry, beauty and flavor. It's not just sugar and eggs thrown together. I tell my pastry chefs to be in tune for all of this. You have to be challenged by using secret or unusual ingredients.": "Ron",

  "The beauty of the world, which is so soon to perish, has two edges, one of laughter, one of anguish, cutting the heart asunder.": "Virginia",
  "I don't love Photoshop; I like imperfection. It doesn't mean ugly. I love a girl with a gap between her teeth, versus perfect white veneers. Perfection is just... boring. Perfect is what's natural or real; that is beauty.": "Marc",
  "Beauty has as many meanings as man has moods. Beauty is the symbol of symbols. Beauty reveals everything, because it expresses nothing. When it shows us itself, it shows us the whole fiery-coloured world.": "Oscar",
  "When I think of art I think of beauty. Beauty is the mystery of life. It is not in the eye it is in the mind. In our minds there is awareness of perfection.": "Agnes",

  "A more secret, sweet, and overpowering beauty appears to man when his heart and mind open to the sentiment of virtue.": "Ralph",
  "Teenagers, especially girl ones, seem like the perfect canary-in-the-coal-mine characters to me. They capture American culture and its perversion, its hypocrisy - how absorbed we are with youth and beauty and sexualized imagery, for instance, while preaching abstinence and modesty.": "Antonya",
  "I think part of the beauty of our relationship with jewelry is that it can change and evolve as we do ourselves.": "Erika",
  "Sexiness wears thin after a while and beauty fades, but to be married to a man who makes you laugh every day, ah, now that's a real treat.": "Joanne",

  "Art is beauty, the perpetual invention of detail, the choice of words, the exquisite care of execution.": "Theophile",

  "The worst beauty advice that I have ever taken has been from people who have told me that sunscreen isn't necessary. Not true!": "Amanda",

  "All identity labels are umbrella terms to some degree, but this term 'bisexual' is not only serviceable, but it is sufficient. And yes, it brings together a bunch of people who are maybe shades different from one another. And maybe that's the beauty of labels: that they force you to be with other people and see the difference.": "Charles",
  "In the hierarchy of public lands, national parks by law have been above the rest: America's most special places, where natural beauty and all its attendant pleasures - quiet waters, the scents of fir and balsam, the hoot of an owl, and the dark of a night sky unsullied by city lights - are sacrosanct.": "Michael",

  "The beauty of social awareness is that a few simple adjustments to what you say can vastly improve your relationships with other people.": "Travis",
  "All my life, my girlfriends are always skinny. Beauty in art has nothing to do with beauty in reality. Why do you like primitive art? Because there is beauty in the deformity.

  "No state can match the beauty of the Chesapeake Bay, our beaches and farms, or the mountains of Western Maryland, the Port of Baltimore, or the historic charm of every corner of our state.": "Larry",
  "I like beauty to be a bit edgy, not typical. For me, the only rule is looking good.": "Francois",
  "For me, beauty is more about prevention than anything. Especially now that I've hit 30, it's more about being careful and maintaining my skin. I want to keep my youth and freshness and be wrinkle-free as long as possible because I don't want to have to cheat - that's what I call any cosmetic surgeries: cheating.": "Julia",
  "There's something about the Pacific Northwest, the scale of it, and the fact that not so long ago people came here and died getting here, and then died the first winter they were here.

  "A woman can be very beautiful and an ideal model and she will photograph incredibly well, but she'll appear in film and it won't work. What works is some fusion of physical beauty with some mental field or whatever you call it. I don't know.": "Oliver",
  "Wealth, beauty, and fame are transient. When those are gone, little is left except the need to be useful.": "Gene",
  "The beauty comes with the balance. Everyone should find his own balance in his personal as well as his professional life. Once you do so, you will feel and look beautiful.": "Karolina",

  "The beauty of Judaism is that it demands we ask questions, especially of ourselves.": "Edgar",
  "Parisian women have an inner elegance that's envied the world over. They are so relaxed about ageing and seem to acquire more charisma and beauty with time. Who wouldn't want to be like them? That's the trick - to embrace the natural progression of life and to be confident.": "Naomi",
  "In a world where it is so easy to neglect, deny, corrupt and suppress the truth, the scientist may find his discipline severe. For him, truth is so seldom the sudden light that shows new order and beauty; more often, truth is the uncharted rock that sinks his ship in the dark.": "John",
  "Beauty is produced by the pleasing appearance and good taste of the whole, and by the dimensions of all the parts being duly proportioned to each other.": "Vitruvius",
  "Nothing will teach you more about perceived value than taking something with literally no value and selling it in the auction format. It teaches you the beauty and power of presentation, and how you can make magic out of nothing.": "Sophia",

  "The grass is always greener on the other side. We are busy applying fairness creams while people in the West go bare-bodied on the beach to get a tan. Indian girls have ruled the roost when it comes to beauty pageants. I flaunt my complexion, and I am proud to be noticed as an Indian wherever I go.": "Shilpa",
  "I marketed pens - on the phone. But the beauty of the gig was that you had to call these strangers and say, 'Hi, how ya doing?' You made up a name, like, 'Hey, it's Edward Quartermaine from California. You're eligible to receive this grandfather clock or a trip to Tahiti.' You promise them all these things if they buy a gross of pens.": "Johnny",
  "Art can never exist without naked beauty displayed.": "William",
  "I like a girl with natural beauty.": "Chandler",
  "The artist forges himself to the others, midway between the beauty he cannot do without and the community he cannot tear himself away from. That is why true artists scorn nothing: they are obliged to understand rather than to judge.": "Albert",
  "The moment you cheat for the sake of beauty, you know you're an artist.": "David",
  "Laughter and joy are part of the beauty of life.": "Diogo",

  "Beauty is now defined by your bones sticking out of your decolletage. For that to be the standard is really perilous for women.": "Alanis",
  "Thanks to capitalism, the importance placed on beauty has never been so manipulated.

  "I feel prematurely old. I'm actually having this major belated quarter-life crisis. I'm turning 30 in a couple of weeks. I've been thinking a lot about mortality.

  "My beauty icons are women whose images are self-created.": "Dita",

  "Aesthetics - rather than reason - shapes our thought processes. First comes aesthetics, then logic.

  "True beauty is when someone radiates that they like themselves.": "Aimee",
  "The thing that surprised me the most is just how much money women that weren't rich were paying for their hair. When you're in a beauty parlor in Harlem next to abandoned buildings and somebody's paying five grand for a weave, that's a bit much.": "Chris",
  "I feel it is important not to get overly obsessed and overly carried away with just the physical aspect. There is more to beauty than just the physical appearance. You are also a complete person, and a woman should have an identity beyond just the way she looks.": "Katrina",
  "Sleep is the real beauty secret, but I don't get enough of that.": "Chelsea",

  "Going to the Academy Awards is something I remember since I was six, when I went with my mom for the first time, 14 with my dad, you know, and there I am, at 22, 23, whatever I was, sitting next to my mom. You know, and then again, there with my dad. Like, there's a beauty to it, and I care deeply about film history.": "Laura",

  "People tend not to use this word beauty because it's not intellectual - but there has to be an overlap between beauty and intellect.": "Tadao",

  "Form follows beauty.": "Oscar",
  "I do take very good care of myself, and I'm always in love. And by that I mean I have an appetite for life. I'm in love with beauty and things and people and love and being in love, and those things I think, on the inside, show on the outside.": "Gloria",
  "You know, all these sentiments about beauty coming from within, they've always resonated when I've read them, but it takes a bit of living to truly appreciate them. To realise we are so much more than our experiences, that we are who we are because of the lessons we've learnt, now that's what true 'beauty' is for me.": "Christy",

  "When girls feel bad about their looks, 60 percent avoid normal daily activities like raising their hand in class or even going to the doctor. That means that girls do not show up for life when they don't feel good enough or pretty enough. A role model can help girls see beauty as a source of confidence, not anxiety.": "Mandy",
  "He who seeks truth shall find beauty. He who seeks beauty shall find vanity. He who seeks order shall find gratification. He who seeks gratification shall be disappointed.

  "Ignoring fame was my rebellion, in a funny way. I was insistent on being normal and doing normal things. It probably wasn't advisable to go to college in America and room with a complete stranger.

  "I usually stalk fans because I think they're really funny on Twitter. They don't know it, but I'll just go through their timelines, and if something is happening in the media, I always read fan accounts instead of the news because they have all the info and make the funniest jokes about it, so that's how I get my gossip - by stalking fans.": "Gigi",

  "I was just a goofy little funny kid, who was always getting sent to the principal. It wasn't serious because I was smart. I wasn't like a true troublemaker, just rambunctious - like, talkative and trying to be funny. That was me in middle-school.": "J.",
  "I was asked to act when I couldn't act. I was asked to sing 'Funny Face' when I couldn't sing, and dance with Fred Astaire when I couldn't dance - and do all kinds of things I wasn't prepared for. Then I tried like mad to cope with it.": "Audrey",

  "I don't say things to be offensive I say things because they're funny to me. It amuses me. ": "Marilyn",
  "I didn't plan to be the rude middle-class comedian. You write a certain type of joke that you find funny, and mine happen to be often rude. Yes, it's juvenile, but that's me.": "Jimmy",
  "We adore babies because they're so cute. And, of course, we are amused by jokes because they are funny. This is all backwards. It is. And Darwin shows us why.": "Daniel",
  "I basically started performing for my mother, going, 'Love me!' What drives you to perform is the need for that primal connection. When I was little, my mother was funny with me, and I started to be charming and funny for her, and I learned that by being entertaining, you make a connection with another person.": "Robin",

  "I think it's a comedian's job to make everything funny. Nothing is off-limits.": "Donald",

  "Sex is funny and love is serious.": "Stephan",
  "I love funny people, and when I'm with funny people, or people who are amusing in their weirdness, I love it. Because that to me is funny, as opposed to someone who stops and says, 'Hey let me tell you a joke.'": "Paul",
  "The fact is I'm choosy, but mainly about a man's character. He has to be interesting, funny and clever. I don't even mind if he's not very good-looking.": "Agyness",
  "I saw a stationery store move.": "Jay",
  "Everything I like is either illegal, immoral or fattening.": "Alexander",
  "Its funny, because for females in general - not just in music, but the corporate ladder as well - anything we do has always been harder for us. When it comes to music, the industry wants you to conform, to look like this and to sound like this and do this or that. It makes it harder. It's harder for us to come out and be bosses and lead the pack.": "Missy",

  "Life can be dramatic and funny all in the same day.": "Jennifer",
  "I've thought for the last decade or so, the only actual place raw truth was seeping through in newspapers was on the Comics Pages. They were able to pull off intelligent social comment, pure truths not found elsewhere in the news pages, and had the ability to make it all funny, entertaining, and pertinent.": "Elayne",
  "There's nothing I dislike more than being in a photo shoot where they say, 'Be yourself.' That's not why I became an actress. That's what I find so funny: that you become an actor, and all of a sudden, everyone wants to know about you. But I didn't become an actor so I could show you me.": "Margot",
  "I'm fascinated with the stories that we tell. Real histories become fantasies and fairy tales, morality tales and fables. There's something interesting and funny and perverse about the way fairytale sometimes passes for history, for truth.": "Kara",

  "If you can't tell a spoon from a ladle, then you're fat!": "Demetri",
  "It's not so much what you learn about Mumbai, it's what you learn about yourself, really. It's a funny old hippie thing, but it's true as well. You find out a lot about yourself and your tolerance, and about your inclusiveness.": "Danny",
  "Hurried and worried until we're buried, and there's no curtain call, Lifes a very funny proposition after all.": "George",
  "Only bad golfers are lucky. They're the ones bouncing balls off trees, curbs, turtles and cars. Good golfers have bad luck. When you hit the ball straight, a funny bounce is bound to be unlucky.": "Lee",
  "People want me to be funny all the time. They think I'm being funny no matter what I say or do and that's not the case.": "Christopher",
  "I was the class podiatrist. I never made it to class clown. I wasn't funny enough. I would examine feet and prescribe and ointment. It was a sad childhood.": "Gilbert",
  "I'm really not that funny in real life! But I am the best audience one could find. I love to laugh.": "Carol",
  "What I like best is a book that's at least funny once in a while. What really knocks me out is a book that, when you're all done reading it, you wish the author that wrote it was a terrific friend of yours and you could call him up on the phone whenever you felt like it. That doesn't happen much, though.": "J.",
  "I have only been funny about seventy four per cent of the time. Yes I think that is right. Seventy-four per cent of the time.": "Will",
  "During the Great Depression, when people laughed their worries disappeared. Audiences loved these funny men. I decided to become one.": "Jerry",
  "Some of the pictures I must say every now and then I just think are going to be funny. When it gets that much, you might as well just pull out all the stops and make it more of a burlesque.": "Martin",
  "I like smart, funny, self-deprecating men.": "Jules",
  "It's a funny thing, the less people have to live for, the less nerve they have to risk losing nothing.": "Zora",

  "I'm blonde and tanned and normal-sized! I'm sweet, shy, funny, have a big heart and I'm nice - and I like to eat.": "Paris",
  "People ask 'do you make a conscious effort not to swear?' - if you're doing silly stuff you're not tempted to put swearing in. All the comics from my childhood, who were funny without swearing, were the people that influenced me. What I do is quite traditional anyway.": "Tim",
  "My parents are both very funny but they're also relatively soft-spoken, normal human beings while I'm just a lunatic. I don't know where this loud, ballsy, hammy ridiculousness came from. I'm just glad I followed my goals and my parents did too. It's not like we even had a plan when I dragged my mom to Los Angeles.": "Emma",
  "I heard that people were really interested in the new haircut, which I think is so funny. Great haircut, I really like it. It goes great with the time period. And I was super, super, super-happy to have my bangs swept to the side rather than straight in front of me, which I dealt with for three seasons. I'm very, very much done with that.": "Elisabeth",
  "Thing is, I'm a funny actor, but I'm not good at being funny. I'm going to ramble for a second: I'm an actor who can make things funny in the moment, like in stakes or in circumstances or out of character.": "Matthew",
  "As soon as you are trying to be funny or dramatic, that's when things start feeling fake and boring.": "Joseph",
  "My grandchildren are fabulous and funny.": "Erica",
  "I love Charlie, Billy Burke's character. Writing for him is so spectacular, he's so funny and wry and every scene he's in he just takes. There's a scene in 'Eclipse' where Bella tells him she's a virgin, and it's the funniest, most awkward scene I've ever seen on film.": "Melissa",
  "Being funny, it turns out, is like being a bank. It's a confidence trick. As long as everyone believes in you, you are fine.": "Evan",
  "It's funny how I use social media because I don't use it to promote my restaurants that much. I use it for social issues and I think that's what it's for. I do a few things - I mess around with music a lot because that's a passion of mine. If something strikes me and I want to share it, I do.": "Tom",
  "When I was in high school I used to sit by myself in the cafeteria - not necessarily by choice - but I thought it was funny to talk to people that weren't there.": "Zach",
  "There are just so many funny kids and teenagers. They're just not aware of how funny they are.": "Vanessa",
  "I've never been to a dinner party where everyone at the dinner table didn't say something funny.": "Lorrie",
  "I don't think I am particularly funny. In fact, I know I'm not.": "Jeremy",
  "The funny thing is that my husband couldn't be sweeter. He looks like this bad boy. He's got tattoos and earrings and a mohawk, but when you talk to him and he's around you, he's such a gentleman. He holds doors for ladies. He pulls out chairs. He cooks. He cleans.": "Malin",
  "The funny guy doesn't get the girl until later in life. High school, college, everyone still wants the brooding, dangerous guy you shouldn't have.": "Will",
  "My kind of wanting to be funny didn't come from need, necessarily. The closest I can analyze it is that it was an easy way to make friends, I found out. It was just a great kind of social tool.": "Will",
  "To handle that stardom, the red carpets, the photo shoots, people all of a sudden recognizing you and following you in everyday life, it's a bit weird. It's strange, and it can have funny effects on you in terms of do you like it or don't you like it. Some people run away from it, some people embrace it; I found a good middle ground.": "Roger",
  "It's funny how the ruthless, murderous gangster has really been romanticized by the media. I mean, I grew up watching the 'Godfathers' and 'Scarface,' and they were the coolest. They're just really interesting stories with great characters. They're rock stars.": "Elena",
  "I don't feel that I'm explaining the world or teaching people anything. And I'm not trying to be a mirror, showing them what's really going on the world. All I'm trying to do is think of stuff that's funny, just like when I'm kidding around with my friends.": "Steven",
  "When I was a kid, I never did funny things to get attention. I was never a funny person. I was never, like, 'Oh, wow. I could say this some day on stage.'": "Steven",
  "Latinos, Asians, African-Americans, women - we're all trying to find our place in this world of cinema and television and theater. And the great thing with comedy is that most of the time, you could be orange. It doesn't matter, as long you're funny.": "Sandra",
  "The funny thing is that I feel close to all my characters. Deep, deep inside them all.": "Paul",
  "I've had an experience through music that has touched almost every part of me. It educated me in ways that I didn't get educated in school. So we try to lay on a bit of that, through being funny, being serious, playing hard.": "Bruce",
  "I tweet from bed. I love it because it's so quick. And it's funny. But it also leaves a lot of room for error because new people don't sense the sarcasm - there's no sarcasm font.": "Christine",
  "As a kid, I thought of myself as a funny person who secretly wanted to be serious, but now I think maybe I'm a serious person who secretly wants to be funny.": "Noah",
  "Being funny, in some ways, is about being connected to psychology.": "Noah",
  "When I play discos in Belfast or freshers' week in Oxford, there are 1,800 kids dressed as me. It's odd, it's funny, and it pays really well.": "David",
  "I do keep getting these bad girl roles. The funny thing is that, honestly, I don't think I'm believable as these aristocratic mean girls. But I do love playing them.": "Katie",
  "If you're OK with being clumsy, it's funny. But if you are super embarrassed, people are going to laugh at you.": "Leo",
  "Unless someone wants to look funny, I'll not recommend anyone to copy my bowling action. But on a serious note, with the confidence that I have got from the amount of runs I have been scoring, when I'm thrown the ball to bowl, I am pretty sure of what I have to do. I may not be the most attractive to watch while bowling, but I can be effective.": "Virat",
  "I wasn't the class clown. I wasn't that obvious. There would be a circle of guys, and they're watching the class clown. And I'm standing in the back, and I turn to the guy next to me and I say something funny to him, and he starts to laugh. And the guy next to him says, 'What did he say?'": "Bob",
  "Funny thing is that the poorer people are, the more generous they seem to be.": "Dolly",
  "You just suddenly think that there's something quite childish about acting. Basically, it's pretending, isn't it? It's good fun and I enjoy it, but it's a funny way of making a living, particularly when you make a very good wage, as I've been fortunate enough to do.": "Kevin",
  "I am interested in shows that are not out-and-out gag fests: you see the truth of a broken heart behind them. That is what life is like: it's really funny, you see funny things as soon as you step out of the room, but underneath that is a whole bag of broken hearts. It's that real pain and that real hilarity that makes life so intriguing.": "Tamsin",
  "The inspiration for my Vines comes from thinking about funny and relatable experiences from my daily life.": "Lele",
  "Objectifying is kind of a funny thing. Art is objectification, all art, because you're taking someone and making them into an object. But people can also talk back more to you when you're sketching them. They can look at you and say, 'Oh man, you got me wrong.'": "Molly",
  "There's a difference between being a comic and a comedian. A comic is a guy who says funny things, and a comedian is a guy who says things funny, and he has a style and point of view that will last much longer.": "Milton",
  "You know what's funny is, when I made 'Saw,' I got accused of being a fascist; when I made 'Insidious,' I got accused of being godless, and now I made the 'Conjuring' films, and I'm accused of being too much God.": "James",
  "It is funny to me that because I can run, because I'm athletic, people tend to see that as my only asset.": "Colin",
  "All I know how to do is take what's on my mind and spit it out funny. I don't know what else I could do besides comedy.": "Ron",
  "It's funny - almost every comedian that I started out with moved to L.A., except for my two friends Hannibal Buress and Amy Schumer. And my two friends that are doing the best in comedy, the most successful friends I have, are Hannibal Buress and Amy Schumer.": "Eric",
  "I've always liked older women. One sad thing about being my age is that there are no older women. I used to amuse my mother's friends even at five or six with witty turns of phrase. Somehow, I just knew how to be funny.": "Howard",
  "It's funny how all of this has worked out - I wasn't popular in high school, but now every drunken guy in the United States wants to be my pal. They all want to buy me a shot, and pretty soon I'm throwing up.": "Jimmy",
  "Funny is funny is funny.": "Bob",
  "Here's the thing - I'm single, I haven't been married, I don't have kids yet. If I do have kids I would be interested to see them in my life, so here's a movie for kids and I'm in there and I'm supposed to be kind of funny for kids.": "Garry",
  "A man's got to take a lot of punishment to write a really funny book.": "Ernest",
  "With improv, it's a combination of listening and not trying to be funny.": "Kristen",
  "The middle class is so funny, it's the class I know best, and it's the class where you find the most pretension, so that's what makes the middle classes so funny.": "J.",
  "I always just wanted to be funny. I never really planned to be scary.": "R.",
  "I've worked a lot with Noah Baumbach, and he doesn't make it easy to like his characters, but the stories are funny and witty and there's an edge to that kind of humanity.": "Ciaran",
  "Viral videos aren't just about being funny. They're about identity creation.": "Ricky",
  "Some people say funny things, but I say things funny.": "Don",
  "It would be pretty funny to see a Beverly Hills white girl with mad rap skills.": "Tori",
  "I'm spending a year dead for tax reasons.": "Douglas",
  "You can always tell when a man's well informed. His views are pretty much like your own.": "H.",
  "When you're out of sight for as long as I was, there's a funny feeling of betrayal that comes over people when they see you again.": "Esther",
  "I think it's harder to go from comedy to drama than from drama to comedy. Seeing you dramatic all the time, they crave to see you being silly or funny. But, seeing you in comedy all the time, it's hard to see that person go be serious, for some reason.": "Evan",
  "I don't know. I think it's funny! I think it's funny! I go, what? It's so absurd. I'm alone.": "Danny",
  "I don't know why I get away with some things. But I'm not a misogynistic, racist person. Yet I do find those jokes funny, so I say them. And I try to say everything kind of in a good spirit.": "Daniel",
  "I'm an optimist, but an optimist who carries a raincoat.": "Harold",
  "If I studied all my life, I couldn't think up half the number of funny things passed in one session of congress.": "Will",
  "I guess when I think about it, one of the things I like to dramatise, and what is sometimes funny, is someone coming unglued. I don't consider myself someone who is making the argument that I support these choices. I just think it can be funny.": "Wes",
  "I'm on so late I'm definitely the last seconds of anyone's attention. So I just want to give them something dumb to laugh at, so they go, 'That's funny,' then fall asleep.": "Jimmy",
  "Inappropriateness is funny to me. Rudeness is hilarious.": "Zach",
  "You're unlikely to discover something new without a lot of practice on old stuff, but further, you should get a heck of a lot of fun out of working out funny relations and interesting things.": "Richard",
  "I'd luv to kiss ya, but I just washed my hair.": "Bette",
  "Never take a solemn oath. People think you mean it.": "Norman",
  "The four building blocks of the universe are fire, water, gravel and vinyl.": "Dave",
  "I guess when you turn off the main road, you have to be prepared to see some funny houses.": "Stephen",
  "A two-year-old is kind of like having a blender, but you don't have a top for it.": "Jerry",
  "I see fighters make funny videos about me and stick them on Facebook and get 20 likes. When I make a video, I sell it to Fox and make seven figures. That's the difference.": "Conor",
  "Everything that used to be a sin is now a disease.": "Bill",
  "I don't follow anything blindly. I have to know the entire thing, if I have to get in to it. It might sound funny to you, but it's like using English language. I use an English word only when I know its meaning and understand its connotation. You won't hear me say, 'What's up, dude' or anything like that just for the heck of it.": "Kailash",
  "All the candy corn that was ever made was made in 1911.": "Lewis",
  "I don't think I would do a straight late-night talk show, like a 'Tonight Show' kind of thing. But I'm open to whatever is done well. I don't have any agenda. I'm not like Fugazi - I'm not trying to be just so punk rock until I die. Whatever is funny is good.": "Eric",
  "The tax collector must love poor people, he's creating so many of them.": "Bill",
  "Being a funny person does an awful lot of things to you. You feel that you mustn't get serious with people. They don't expect it from you, and they don't want to see it. You're not entitled to be serious, you're a clown.": "Fanny",
  "There's a darkness under 'The Hangover' because ultimately there's a missing person and it's not really that funny. There's a sort of darkness under it that I love, and still people are laughing as hard if not harder than they did in 'Old School.'": "Todd",
  "Memories are doing funny things to us.": "Milos",
  "I've always wanted to go to Switzerland to see what the army does with those wee red knives.": "Billy",

  "I want my children to have all the things I couldn't afford. Then I want to move in with them.": "Phyllis",
  "I think Irish women are strong as horses, incredibly loyal and for the most part, funny, witty, bright and optimistic in the face of devastating reality.": "Fionnula",
  "I consider that a man's brain originally is like a little empty attic, and you have to stock it with such furniture as you choose.": "Arthur",
  "If it's the Psychic Network why do they need a phone number?": "Robin",
  "I'd rather not have a moment when I'm known for my looks being funny and interesting lasts longer.": "Kelly",
  "It's obviously funny to be a meme, so I could be down with it in that regard, but it also belittles one's art.": "Grimes",
  "Films are big hits when they touch a lot of people. Things are not funny in a vacuum, they're funny because we respond to some personal dislocation, some embarrassment, some humiliation, some pain we've suffered, or some desire we have.": "Harold",
  "When I turned about 12 or 13, I realised that being funny wasn't about remembering jokes. It was about creating them.": "Paul",
  "Maybe people don't see me as believable playing a person of today. I guess I'm just more realistic in a corset and funny hairstyles.": "Katie",
  "Progress might have been alright once, but it has gone on too long.": "Ogden",
  "You know, you can touch a stick of dynamite, but if you touch a venomous snake it'll turn around and bite you and kill you so fast it's not even funny.": "Steve",
  "Conversation would be vastly improved by the constant use of four simple words: I do not know.": "Andre",
  "In comic strips, the person on the left always speaks first.": "George",
  "Do not let a flattering woman coax and wheedle you and deceive you she is after your barn.": "Hesiod",
  "A lot of baby boomers are baby bongers.": "Kevin",
  "Being a stand-up is my mission in life; it's my passion. My ongoing goal is to simply be funny, on my own, in front of a roomful of strangers.": "Jerry",
  "My mum passing away wasn't funny, but that funeral and what I went through, the things that happened, looking back at it, there were funny moments. You have to be strong enough to look back at it, to sit and assess the situation.": "Kevin",
  "Being a humorist is not a voluntary thing. You can tell this because in a situation where saying a funny thing will cause a lot of trouble, a humorist will still say the funny thing. No matter how inappropriate.": "P.",
  "The men I idolized built their bodies and became somebody - like Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger - and I thought, 'That can be me.' So I started working out. The funny thing is I didn't realize back then that I was having a defining moment.": "Dwayne",
  "Whatever is funny is subversive, every joke is ultimately a custard pie... a dirty joke is a sort of mental rebellion.": "George",
  "I like drama. I love being in a drama where I get to be the funny guy. That's what I really love the most.": "John",
  "It's funny the way most people love the dead. Once you are dead, you are made for life.": "Jimi",
  "There's also a certain rhythm to the way Jews talk that might be funny.": "Larry",
  "I get asked, 'Who would you really like to work with?' I'm already working with them. Smart, talented, funny people, good musicians, an extended family, good friends.": "Christopher",
  "Just telling the facts are no longer enough. You now have to be persuasive, charismatic, interesting, and funny. Just telling people things isn't enough anymore.": "Milo",
  "Funny is funny. I dare anyone to look at Tim Conway and Harvey Korman doing the dentist sketch, which is more than 40 years old, and not scream with laughter.": "Carol",
  "Television has brought back murder into the home - where it belongs.": "Alfred",
  "I have tried to know absolutely nothing about a great many things, and I have succeeded fairly well.": "Robert",
  "What do I know of man's destiny? I could tell you more about radishes.": "Samuel",
  "I drank some boiling water because I wanted to whistle.": "Mitch",
  "Who picks your clothes - Stevie Wonder?": "Don",
  "I love things made out of animals. It's just so funny to think of someone saying, 'I need a letter opener. I guess I'll have to kill a deer.": "David",
  "I love readings and my readers, but the din of voices of the audience gives me stage fright, and the din of voices inside whisper that I am a fraud, and that the jig is up. Surely someone will rise up from the audience and say out loud that not only am I not funny and helpful, but I'm annoying, and a phony.": "Anne",
  "I never liked apples. In fact, when I was a little girl, my mom wanted to give me apples in my lunch box and I would ask for green peppers. So bizarre... It's funny - I don't have an apple a day, but I can say that I have a few a week.": "Lana",
  "The funny thing is, I've never really hurt myself in an action movie. I've done 'Wanted,' 'X-Men,' 'Welcome To The Punch,' even 'Trance' to a certain extent has little bits of action and stuff, but I've never really hurt myself at all - not even like a sprained ankle.": "James",
  "Isn't it funny how babies laugh a lot? I read a toddler, a young child laughs 300 times a day. The average adult laughs, like, four times a day. God put it in them. He put the laugh in us, but I think sometimes we let life get us down, you know, have bad breaks, and we lose our breaks.": "Joel",
  "Almost anything can be funny if said the right way - but it has to be said the right way.": "Kevin",
  "I do not think that obsession is funny or that not being able to stop one's intensity is funny.": "Jim",
  "Well in the book Carrie was my alter ego. In real life, Sarah Jessica and I don't look anything alike. But people do say that we sound alike. Sarah Jessica is an adorable girl and she is very funny.": "Candace",
  "It's funny because it's funny.": "David",
  "I could party in a cardboard box with people who are funny and don't care. For me, it's really about who I surround myself with, so I just try to always be with hilarious people.": "Kesha",
  "I think there have always been funny women, from Carol Burnett to Joan Rivers. When the audience sees a woman, they innately know she's worked twice as hard to get there, she's had to prove that she can be the leader, first, and then be funny on top of it. She has to emit a confidence that she's in control.": "Wendy",
  "My father was a really funny guy. He lived a good long life. And he was the reason I wanted to be funny and become a comedian and a comedy writer, so to say that he's somewhat of a mythic figure in my life would be an understatement.": "Carol",
  "I don't mean to be funny.": "Yogi",
  "I remember straightening my hair because I wanted to be like everybody else, and now the fact that anybody would emulate what I do? It's just funny.": "Taylor",
  "It's funny, in literature no one ever goes to the lavatory.": "Tom",
  "I can be dramatic. I can be funny. I can be sexy. I can be sad. I can be glad.": "Kimberly",
  "It's funny, because there are so many stereotypes out there about actors and movie stars in general, but I've had a great opportunity to meet a lot of them, and maybe it's just because they don't behave that way around me, but I rarely see that kind of abuse of power.": "Ryan",
  "I'm very lighthearted, outgoing, friendly, and funny, so I like to try new things.": "Chandler",
  "I try to be funny and not ignorant.": "Kevin",
  "There's a fine line between angry and grumpy. Angry isn't nice, but grumpy is funny.": "Rick",
  "Eyebrows are really important because they structure the face. In school it was funny because I was always the one walking around with tweezers plucking my girlfriends' eyebrows. I was really good; eyebrow tweezing runs in my family - my mother used to do mine, and I picked it up.": "Rita",
  "Most of my show is true; like, 90% of everything I say on stage is true. I just have to find the way to make it funny - that's the difficult thing.": "Trevor",
  "The thing I most hate about the Left is that they want to stop us laughing - to prescribe which jokes are OK and which are not OK to make in public and to draw artificial lines around certain subjects. I find all sorts of inappropriate things funny.": "Milo",
  "A reputation takes years and years and years to build, and it takes one press of a button to ruin it. Don't let that happen to you. You've done so much work; you've put in so much effort. Don't let one moment ruin your entire life because you wanted to be funny or you were mad or because you had a mood.": "J.",
  "I'm a prankster, so some of the - you know, I like a good joke. I think when it's funny, it's funny.": "Sean",
  "Certainly there are things in life that money can't buy, but it's very funny - Did you ever try buying them without money?": "Ogden",
  "I was the kid next door's imaginary friend.": "Emo",
  "With my boyfriend, we can make sexist jokes to each other because we know it's absolutely not true. If I get home from a long day and he says: 'Go on, get in the kitchen,' it's funny because we know it's not our lives.": "Emily",
  "It's grueling never knowing if the audience is going to think you're funny. It's soul-destroying when they don't laugh.": "Vince",
  "It's funny how God will just keep using you, and our motto around our family forever has been, 'Just let Him use you.'": "Kim",
  "It's funny how seeing a love story never gets boring, because it's the dream, isn't it? It's the dream to have a true connection with another human being.": "Felicity",
  "As far as I'm concerned, 'whom' is a word that was invented to make everyone sound like a butler.": "Calvin",
  "I think they should have a Barbie with a buzz cut.": "Ellen",
  "An optimist is a fellow who believes a housefly is looking for a way to get out.": "George",

  "I'd never been in play long enough for the flowers to die in the dressing room.": "Mercedes",
  "I was sleeping the other night, alone, thanks to the exterminator.": "Emo",
  "God writes a lot of comedy... the trouble is, he's stuck with so many bad actors who don't know how to play funny.": "Garrison",
  "It's funny how sometimes how the public some people think I was born like this. That I maybe I sleep and I do big muscle, but its a lot of work to look like this and to be in this kind of condition.": "Lou",
  "I can do comedy, so people want me to do that, but the other side of comedy is depression. Deep, deep depression is the flip side of comedy. Casting agents don't realize it but in order to be funny you have to have that other side.": "Parker",
  "In my circle of friends, I've always been loud and funny and talkative. But as soon as I step out of that circle, I get very quiet and introspective. I don't want the spotlight on me.": "Rosie",
  "Well, I'm not afraid to say something if I think it's funny, even if it's harsh or racist.": "Sarah",
  "I write funny. If I can make my wife laugh, I know I'm on the right track. But yes, I don't like to get Maudlin. And I have a tendency towards it.": "Gene",
  "I have no agenda except to be funny. Neither I or the writers profess to offer any worldly wisdom.": "Julia",
  "Half of the great comedians I've had in my shows and that I paid a lot of money to and who made my customers shriek were not only not funny to me, but I couldn't understand why they were funny to anybody.": "Florenz",
  "People don't realize that I'm really funny and I'm an excellent bridge player.": "Sheryl",

  "One thing the blues ain't, is funny.": "Stephen",
  "We have never been strictly political, only strictly funny.": "Adrian",
  "About 100 things that your kid will do that will surprise you and break your heart and it will be a combination of fact based therapy, medically advised kinds of passages accompanied by celebrity anecdotes and just some funny stuff to lighten the load.": "Alan",
  "I wasn't very funny or flashy, I was kind of boring.": "Katie",
  "But I think Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang really got that thing where, if a movie reads really funny and then has some dramatic or violent or sinister stuff in it, you can't forget that primarily it has to be even funnier than you read it or that other stuff doesn't work.": "Robert",
  "When I tell people I'm a comedian they say, 'Oh, are you funny?' I say, 'No, it's not that kind of comedy.'": "Susan",
  "I used to think that everything was just being funny but now I don't know. I mean, how can you tell?": "Andy",
  "I don't need somebody behind a desk to tell me what a marketing survey says is funny. I got 3 million miles and 70,000 tickets sold, telling me that I know how to make people laugh.": "D.",
  "Eddie Drake is sort of this loose cannon, funny, edgy guy, who has this really foolish, foolish mustache.": "Lee",
  "Steve Martin is one of the most intelligent, well-read human beings that I've ever come across. He is equally as funny off screen as he is on. But he also has a very intellectual side, and he's a really nice human being. We actually become good friends.": "Anthony",
  "I had gotten to a place where I truly believed everything I was called: 'not sexy,' 'not funny,' 'too intense,' desperate.' All those labels they gave me, I took them because there wasn't a trace of my true self left.": "Naomi",
  "I wanted to be that quirky girl who writes funny songs that still have meaning.": "Katy",
  "There are a lot of funny people and a lot of unfunny people. Some of them are women and some of them are dudes.": "Lake",
  "We've seen some insane signs: 'Is that a loaf of bread in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?' Funny stuff along those lines. Very original. One just said, 'I will do unspeakable things.' I thought that was very interesting - and mildly terrifying!": "Josh",
  "I put on a big show when I write something I think is funny.": "Judd",
  "I tend to play characters that I can infuse with certain kinds of humour. Even the baddest guy can be funny in his own particular way. I want the audience to engage with the character on some deeper level so that they leave the cinema still thinking about him.": "Samuel",
  "It's funny - in elementary school, I went by Amber. I never liked Tiffani.": "Tiffani",
  "I think I've got a funny face.": "Dominic",
  "I mean, I'm married first of all to one of, if not the most wonderful women in the world. She is everything - funny, attractive, hard-working, she has integrity, she loves me to bits.": "Seal",
  "You know being relevant or coming up with something interesting, funny to say about what's current is just as hard as it might ever be depending on the serendipity of it all.": "Lily",
  "I turned down 'Some Like It Hot.' See how smart I am? I felt I couldn't bring anything funny to it. The outfit was funny. I don't need to compete with the wardrobe.": "Jerry",
  "I don't really need to be dirty to be funny.": "Jimmy",
  "I never know when I am being funny, and the other way too. I don't think you can think about that. I don't think you can try to be funny. Some people are just funny.": "Christopher",
  "Funny enough, if you are looking at people these days who are putting Botox in their face and getting all sorts of plastic surgery, we look at them and go, I can tell you've had Botox. I can tell you've had plastic surgery. You look really strange to me. But no one's saying anything. We're just accepting the fact that they're strange-looking.": "Guy",
  "It is funny what a year can do.": "Victor",
  "Sixth grade was a big time, in my childhood, of hoops and friendship, and coming up with funny things.": "Adam",
  "There's always something funny about men chasing women.": "David",
  "I'm never afraid to try something if I think it's funny. And I know I'll regret it if I don't.": "Seann",
  "If Joy Behar or Sherri Shepherd was a dude, they'd be off TV. They're not funny enough for dudes. What if Roseanne Barr was a dude? Think we'd know who she was?": "Adam",
  "Being mean just for being mean's sake isn't funny.": "Kaitlin",
  "Gotta stay in the gym, stay funny, stay sharp. I just love working.": "Marlon",
  "I think there's something in the fact that it's hard to be good looking and funny. You have to have an oddball quality people have to sympathise with you to find you funny. ": "Chris",
  "That's a funny thing, fame. People definitely do treat you differently. When you begin to be successful, people say, 'Don't go changing.' Well, that's easy to say, but the fact is, you don't change at all - other people do.": "Jonathan",
  "I think that 'Hangover II' is as funny as 'The Hangover I,' honest to God, but I think that it's a little bit darker, and the stakes are a little bit higher.": "Todd",
  "It's funny when you know you're playing two characters and you're aware of how you have to play each one into your performance of the other. You're constantly at the back of your mind thinking and it all gets a bit confusing.": "Jamie",
  "I would love to write a mystery - a romantic, funny mystery.": "Cecelia",
  "A lot of comedies are based on the reaction shot. You have one person doing something stupid and one person is generally the straight man, and the laughs generally come on the reaction of the straight man to the funny thing the other person has done.": "Richard",
  "I always thought 'chick lit' meant third-person contemporary funny novels, dealing with issues of the day. I mean, it's not the ideal term; when I'm asked to describe what I do, I say I write romantic comedies, cause that's what I feel they are. But I'm quite pragmatic.": "Sophie",
  "Being effective at social media, whether for business or personal use, means capturing people who have short attention spans. They're only a click away from a picture of a funny cat, so you have to make your thing more compelling than that cat. And that can be a high bar.": "Alexis",
  "You know, what's funny to one person is not at all to someone else.": "Steve",
  "I always find it funny when I watch actors talking about, 'I chose to do this part.' A lot of times it's 'you're lucky to get the job.' We're like, 'Thank you so much.'": "Lucy",
  "Lot of ugly funny dudes end up with some pretty gorgeous women. Women are much deeper than us in choosing a mate - they see in the long term.": "Patton",
  "Yes, we do defend our office as we do defend our homes. This is a constitutional right everybody has, and nothing's funny about that. The only reason they get mad at the Black Panther Party when you do it is for the simple reason that we're political.": "Fred",
  "Children are the most honest critics. They will say 'You're funny', but also 'You're pathetic - go away.'": "Dylan",
  "I find being funny very hard work. I am always asked about it, and I feel guilty saying that, but it's the truth. I love my work, but it ain't easy.": "Madeline",
  "I think stutterers are funny. And I know it's rude and politically incorrect to laugh at stutterers. But I think it is okay because I know why they're funny. They make people nervous. People think, when on earth are they going to get the word out, so they start laughing out of their own nervousness.": "James",
  "What bothers most critics of my work is the goofiness. One reviewer said I need to make up my mind if want to be funny or serious. My response is that I will make up my mind when God does, because life is a commingling of the sacred and the profane, good and evil. To try and separate them is fallacy.": "Tom",
  "If something is shocking without being funny it's hard to justify.": "Seth",
  "On 'The Simpsons,' I will say that we definitely like to comment on what's going on in the world, and we try to be funny. If we can figure out a way of being funny about it, then we've gone part of the way of accomplishing our task.": "Matt",
  "I think Amy Poehler and Tina Fey have done so much for women in comedy in the sense that they've normalized it. You don't think, 'I'm going to watch that comedy starring a woman,' you think, 'I'm going to watch that funny show.' They refuse to play the foils for men, or be reduced to the butt of every joke, and I love that about both of them.": "Tatiana",
  "I grew up in a time when women didn't really do comedy. You had to be homely, overweight, an old maid, all that. You had to play a stereotype, because very attractive women were not supposed to be funny - because it's powerful; it's a threat.": "Lily",
  "Someone said to me at a party once, 'Oh, yeah, you're a comedian? Then how come you're not funny now?' And I just wanted to say, 'Well, I'm just going to take this conversation we're having and then repeat that to strangers, and then that's the joke. You're the joke later.'": "Mike",
  "My ideal prom date would have to be cute, funny, sweet, nice.": "Kendall",
  "I think it would be funny for people to read in obituaries of me that my major contribution to the arts was the popularization of the phrases 'neutral facial expression' and 'screaming in agony.'": "Tao",
  "I get a kick out of people saying I was funny.": "Dick",
  "As a youngster, my mother and father always drilled into my head having something to fall back on. My father was kind of funny. I'd score 40 points. I'd come home and say, 'Look dad, I scored 40.' He'd never have a smile on his face. He'd be like, 'I saw that move you did. What if you'd hurt your knee?'": "Shaquille",
  "I remember people saying: 'You look funny, your hair is so black, you have a flat nose,' but I didn't think of it being racism, and I still don't. But there was a sense of difference, of being an outsider.": "Sadie",
  "You shouldn't get too close to the truth, because then maybe you stop being funny.": "Bob",
  "I know that I'm going to die and that you're going to die. I can't do anything about that. But I can explore it through a metaphor and make a kind of funny, dark story about it, and in doing so, really exhaust and research as many aspects of it as I can imagine. And in a way, that does give me some closure.": "Chuck",
  "I've always surrounded myself with funny people.": "Leslie",
  "I try to write stories that are thrilling and full of mystery and funny all at the same time, stories that raise moral questions but come up with very few moral answers, stories that emotionally touch readers through the characters.": "William",
  "I think funny is just the foundation. I don't really think, to some extent, funny is the absolute most important thing. It should also communicate some idea through the medium of cartooning. Just to be funny is... You know what, the things that you laugh hardest at aren't cartoons.": "Robert",
  "Every girls' night needs a funny movie and a good conversation about guys! My friends and I also love picking outfits out for each other to try on at slumber parties. It's so fun.": "Jennette",
  "When I was right out of college, I felt competitive with some of the guys in my class over career stuff. It's funny now to think about it - that a friend getting a job or something had anything to do with me... I think that my relationship with my wife has played a pivotal role in the chilling out of Aaron.": "Aaron",
  "I always have a funny story at communion time that underscores that no one is perfect, and that communion is not for perfect people but for hungry people.": "Greg",
  "I love to swim. When I jump in the water, I feel like I'm 12 years old again. It's really funny how it does that to me.": "Summer",
  "When Jonathan Winters died, it was like, 'Oh, man!' I knew he was frail, but I always thought he was going to last longer. I knew him as being really funny, but at the same time, he had a dark side.": "Robin",
  "I was a good student until I turned 15. Then, all of a sudden, it didn't matter to me anymore. Isn't that funny. I don't want to go to college. I always knew that. But it's hard. My friends are going, and I feel a little left behind.": "Clara",
  "The gummy bears tattoo was my idea. It's my son's favorite candy. The sketch was my other son's idea. It's a self-portrait of himself. I just showed the artist his sketch and had him tattoo it on my forearm. It looks like a stick person with big hair. It's pretty funny.": "Prince",
  "The real world has always been far more exciting and funny and dangerous to me than anything somebody could conjure up sitting in front of a computer.": "Tony",
  "I love playing smart and tough and having funny lines.": "Jane",
  "There are a lot of funny things that happen in one's life.": "Pierce",
  "I love my brothers' kids. It's funny - as an uncle, you become so protective of them.": "Liam",
  "The human brain is a funny thing: it's very susceptible to tempo and melody. You put the right words to it, and it becomes very influential.": "Ray",
  "It's funny how you get a bit older and become more accepting of things. When you're in your twenties, you're skeptical of everything. I definitely felt like that.": "Jamie",
  "My job is to bring the tickle. I know what's funny.": "Leslie",
  "I make funny videos of me playing video games, and I share those moments.": "PewDiePie",
  "I'm screamingly funny, you know, I really am in the books. And that helps because I'm funnier than a lot of people, I think, and that's appreciated by young people.": "Kurt",
  "Rapping can be repetition sometimes. Sometimes you gotta highlight your words in a certain kind of way. So I always was a fan of sing-rapping. It was always funny to me a little bit, and I think that being funny and being able to laugh, even at yourself, is a form of flattery.": "ASAP",
  "I seem to get into situations that make people laugh, but I don't consider myself that funny of a person. I'm not witty. I'm kind of slow in conversations. I'm not that articulate with jokes. The first time I made stuff and screened it for an audience, I was surprised what people were laughing at.": "Nathan",
  "I always believe that funny is serious and serious is funny. You don't really need a distinction between them.": "Trevor",
  "Sometimes I'm really funny, sometimes I'm quiet, sometimes I'm shy, but I'm constantly changing.": "Elle",
  "There are precedents for what happens when societies allow the divide between rich and poor to get so huge that it stops being funny and starts becoming a sick, blood-boiling joke. If you had a Tardis, you could go back to 1917 and ask the Russian royal family how it was all going.": "John",
  "When it comes down to it, glam rock was all very amusing. At the time, it was funny, then a few years later it became sort of serious-looking and a bit foreboding.": "David",
  "I did feel funny about being fair and having red hair and freckles. I did not like that because I grew up in a neighbourhood where no one had red hair. I felt very conspicuous but not in a nice way.": "Patti",
  "It's funny: most people who recognize me on the subway and stuff - it's much more they think of me as a funny guy. I get much more of people telling me how much I make them laugh, actually. Which is nice.": "Paul",
  "In person, my father is so friendly, so considerate, so funny, and so real. I have admired my father all of my life, and I love him with all my heart.": "Tiffany",
  "I don't argue with people... if they say I'm not funny, they're right, for them.": "Hannibal",
  "If you look at shows like 'Def Comedy Jam' in its heyday, there were so many really funny, talented black comics that never would have gotten on that show because they just weren't doing comedy that fit that mold.": "Aisha",
  "I feel like, if there's an elephant in the room, I'd really like to start off by introducing the elephant in the room. And sometimes it's funny.": "Louis",
  "I'm going to take this God-given gift of being funny, and I'm going to spread it out like peanut butter on everything I do.": "Steve",
  "I auditioned for a movie recently, and when I went in, the producer said he'd told one of its stars, Naomi Watts, that he was auditioning me, and she'd said, 'She's so funny; she's a great actress - you should hire her.' What a lovely, kind, and supportive thing to do for another woman.": "Isla",
  "If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it at all. And if you do have to say it, make it really funny so I can screenshot it and save it for later.": "Sabrina",
  "I think politics is extremely funny in and of itself.": "Jesse",
  "It's funny how God will change your plans for you when he's ready.": "Brett",
  "My friend and I founded the New York Arab-American Comedy Festival to counter the negative images of Arabs in media. And we always made sure that the comedy came first. So we weren't a bunch of Arabs trying to be funny. We were a bunch of comedians who just happened to be of Arab heritage.": "Maysoon",
  "We spend a lot of time on Skype and other video interviews, and it's funny how many people will prepare for a Skype interview by wearing a formal suit jacket with pajama pants on the bottom. Then suddenly, someone is at the door, and you have to get up, and you realize you're wearing reindeer boxers. Just put pants on.": "Kathryn",
  "I want to give kids that fall-off-the-bed-laughing feeling. Either that, or the sixth-grade feeling that life is hard - sometimes unbearably hard - and it is ultimately about death. But in the meantime, life can be really funny, too.": "Kate",
  "The music industry is really funny, when you have a hit record, everyone knows who are you, everyone wants to do duets with you, then if you have a miss, people suffer from amnesia.": "Seal",
  "I had an idea of what I thought was funny. It's kind of based on how I am.": "Jennifer",
  "But you can't focus on things that matter if all you've been is asleep for forty years. Funny how sleep rhymes with sheep. You know.": "Charlie",
  "The word 'funny' is a bit like the word 'love' - we don't have enough words to describe the many varieties.": "George",
  "A lot of modern comedies are difficult to watch too, because they're so ironic and so detached and so quote-unquote clever. They kind of keep you at arm's length. They can be really funny, but they're not really nourishing.": "Ty",
  "I'd love to do a comedy. I'm terrified of comedy. I don't think I'm funny, but I guess that's why it's so thrilling.": "Jared",
  "There is nothing funny about a well-adjusted, intelligent person making the right choices.": "Tim",
  "Like almost everyone who uses e-mail, I receive a ton of spam every day. Much of it offers to help me get out of debt or get rich quick. It would be funny if it weren't so exciting.": "Bill",
  "I'm undaunted in my quest to amuse myself by constantly changing my hair.": "Hillary"
