  "When I graduated from high school, the teacher said I was throwing my life away following music, and the same teacher invited me back to speak at the school. I don't say that to brag, I just want to be an example.": "Big",
  "As a former teacher and someone who has devoted her entire career to children and public schools, I understand the pain and frustration of parents who feel their children are not receiving the education they deserve.": "Randi",
  "Merit pay has failed repeatedly, and it's no surprise. When you base teacher pay on standardized test scores, you won't improve education; you just promote the high-stakes testing craze that's led parents, students and educators to shout 'Enough!' all across the country.": "Randi",
  "I've worked in public education for 30 years - as a teacher, a lawyer and union leader. I've visited hundreds of schools and districts. I've seen leaders from the classroom to the national stage who have been willing to set aside their differences and do the hard work that's necessary to create real, enduring change.": "Randi",
  "I can't imagine my life without books. My father was an electrical engineer, and my mother was a public school teacher. Books were an integral part of my childhood.": "Randi",
  "Throughout my career as a lawyer, teacher and labor leader, books have remained my constant companion - stuffed into a briefcase, overflowing on my bedside table, stacked on my desk at work. Books have carried me to distant worlds, opened new doors and made me feel empathy, compassion, anger, fear, joy, acceptance - and everything in between.": "Randi",
  "On the first day of school, you got to be real careful where you sit. You walk into the classroom and just plunk your stuff down on any old desk, and the next thing you know the teacher is saying, 'I hope you all like where you're sitting, because these are your permanent seats.'": "Jeff",
  "My first public impression was my French teacher, Derek Swift.": "Rory",
  "My brother's a teacher in Costa Rica and actually does a more important and significant job than I will ever do.": "Dominic",
  "President Obama and Secretary Duncan have made stronger teacher evaluation a key part of their education reform efforts. Under their signature plan, called 'Race to the Top,' states can win federal support for schools by improving teacher evaluations.": "Juan",
  "In math, you could get 100 percent. It was very fair. That's what I liked about math. You could figure it out, and the teacher couldn't have a stupid opinion about it.": "Norm",
  "I want to be able to look my daughter's teacher in the eye and say, 'Your pension will be there.' I need to know that her pension will match up with a promise we can keep.": "Gina",
  "It's not our job to choose the best Sunday school teacher, like Jimmy Carter was. It's our job to choose who would defend and protect our nation, who would be the best president.": "Jerry",
  "I have to be a teacher to my daughters.": "Carnie",
  "I've always said I'm a teacher at heart.": "Alex",
  "My teacher, my great cello teacher Leonard Rose, was such a great cellist, and nurturing man, very patient. But I grew up not only admiring him, but obviously Casals, Rostrotovich, Jacqueline du Pre, and many others, including many of my peers and contemporaries.": "Yo-Yo",
  "I think there are so many ways to become interested in music. I believe signs of sustained interest gives a sense of the right time. Music, if thought of as a language, would perhaps indicate that as early as possible is not so bad. I do believe that a really nurturing first teacher that makes the child love something is crucial.": "Yo-Yo",
  "Ineffective substitute teaching is a problem that means thousands of hours of lost learning for America's students. It cannot be dismissed with a sigh and 'Just wait for the teacher to come back on Monday.'": "Adora",
  "Nearly everyone I met, worked with, or read about was my teacher, one way or another.": "Loretta",
  "I remember, when I was at school, we would have a 10-minute storytelling session where we'd all sit on the floor cross-legged, and the teacher would read. It became something we all really looked forward to. That was part of the reason I grew to love stories.": "Malorie",
  "I've noticed that my resolutions involve me not doing stuff that I wasn't going to do anyway so here's something more positive. I'm going to retrain as a Latin teacher in a provincial public school.": "Arthur",
  "During my childhood, my father, a Southern Baptist minister, and my mother, a teacher, made sure I took educational trips to cities such as Washington, D.C., Williamsburg, Va., Philadelphia, and Boston to learn about America's history.": "Tim",
  "I have to tell you, I'm a great teacher. Ask anybody who worked for me, except some secretaries who weren't very good.": "Dawn",
  "I see myself as, first and above all, a teacher of history; next, a writer of European history; next, a commentator on European affairs; next, a public intellectual voice within the American left; and only then an occasional, opportunistic participant in the pained American discussion of the Jewish matter.": "Tony",
  "My mother was a piano teacher, my father an inventor. He invented the reflective paint they still use on airstrips. They had faith in my ambition, and I think that made all the difference.": "Chuck",
  "No voice teacher can be all things to all people. You have to gain information from whatever sources you can. You have to listen.": "Renee",
  "I grew up middle class - my dad was a high school teacher; there were five kids in our family. We all shared a nine-hundred-square-foot home with one bathroom. That was exciting. And my wife is Irish Catholic and also very, very barely middle class.": "Dana",
  "A self-defined challenge is an irresistible teacher.": "Marilyn",
  "I was a nursery school teacher, and I worked with youth groups. I loved that job. It was exhausting, but you got a lot back - all their purity and insight and innocence is so on the surface, and they're so unrepressed; they'd really scream at you and then give you a massive kiss.": "Bat",
  "I want to work with kids. I would love to be a teacher.": "Amy",
  "When I was in the first grade I was afraid of the teacher and had a miserable time in the reading circle, a difficulty that was overcome by the loving patience of my second grade teacher. Even though I could read, I refused to do so.": "Beverly",
  "When I was able to go to school in my early years, my third grade teacher, Ms. Harris, convinced me that one day I would be a writer. I heard her, but I knew that I had to leave Georgia, and unlike my friend Ray Charles, I did not go around with 'Georgia on My Mind.'": "John",
  "I was ridiculed in public school for being smart. A teacher's pet.": "Julia",
  "I worked as a teacher in the public school system in New York City for several years, and I was a victim of the layoffs, you know, in the mid-'70s. And then I worked as a sales engineer for a company in New Jersey that was selling industrial filtration equipment.": "Feisal",
  "My painting teacher in high school used to say, 'I can't paint like I want to, but through practice I'll get better.' But I don't think that's true. I think sometimes you just can't paint.": "Ellie",
  "America must be the teacher of democracy, not the advertiser of the consumer society. It is unrealistic for the rest of the world to reach the American living standard.": "Mikhail",
  "I wanted to be a landscape architect, but I trained as a teacher; I worked in publishing; I was a waitress.": "Deborah",
  "My ambition in high school was to be a high school coach and teacher, and that's still what I do: teach.": "Mike",
  "My dad never decided what he wanted to do; at times he fought in the army, was a teacher, a boxer, a light engineer, and a then a publican. My mum was a traditional housewife and mother. They showed my brother and I unconditional love.": "Anthony",
  "When I was really young, I wanted to be a history teacher because I was obsessed with the past.": "Russell",
  "My fascination with women's clothes began very early. My mother was a very fashionable woman. She also made her own clothes. She had these fashion magazines, and I would draw the women in them. My middle school art teacher suggested that I have a fashion drawing show.": "Alexander",
  "Liz Benedict, a teacher of mine at Iowa, is the person who introduced me to James Salter's work.": "Alexander",
  "Every moral teacher or spiritual adviser gives injunctions about how to live wisely and well. But life is so complicated and full of uncertainty that rules seldom tell us quite what to do.": "Ian",
  "My mom is a public school teacher and works with third grade students.": "Jane",
  "I had a brilliant drama teacher while I was at Roland Park: Ann Mainolfi. But the school was mostly rich in academics. It wasn't like I was prepping myself for a life in acting. There, you prepped yourself to have a stable future. The school's piece de resistance is college prep - it didn't teach you how to audition for a TV show.": "Nicole",
  "In the fourth grade, my history teacher gave us a project: Why was the auto industry located in Detroit, Michigan? I didn't know I was going to be an economist, but I knew I was going to do something that was involved in answering questions like that one because I thought that was a fascinating question.": "Mark",
  "We need balance. We need to balance our inner life with our outer life. Nature is always sitting there waiting to help us, but we have to do the work. Nature is probably the greatest teacher that we'll ever have... the earth and nature.": "Dave",
  "In the playground, I always made people laugh; I used to charge them three pence for an impression of a teacher. It kept me in toffees.": "Sue",
  "There are moments as a teacher when I'm conscious that I'm trotting out the same exact phrase my professor used with me years ago. It's an eerie feeling, as if my old mentor is not just in the room, but in my shoes, using me as his mouthpiece.": "Abraham",
  "Poetry is a special use of language that opens onto the real. The business of the poet is truth telling, which is why in the Celtic tradition no one could be a teacher unless he or she was a poet.": "Huston",
  "I was a teacher once.": "Nita",
  "My dad was a football player - a soccer player - for Manchester United, and I loved playing football, but I also happened to be the guy in class who was pretty good at sight reading. My teacher gave me scripts, and I was very comfortable.": "Ian",
  "I had a teacher at school who said, 'We are going to do a play next year, and you're in it.' He said, 'You should try out for the Royal Academy as an actor.' I did and got in. I was 17. My mum wasn't too happy, but it worked out OK.": "Ian",
  "We spend the first twelve months of our children's lives teaching them to walk and talk and the next twelve telling them to sit down and shut up.": "Phyllis",
  "I could never let the teacher down. I always worked hard, too scared to get in trouble.": "Zoe",
  "If I can only be known as one thing, then, well, I guess it would be poet and performer and teacher.": "Juan",
  "I do home schooling. I went to regular school until fifth grade, and then I started doing home schooling, which it's completely different. I have a teacher on set with me and I just work with her, one-on-one.": "Miranda",
  "I think day care is terrific. Kids get to be around other kids, and they're playing, and they're teaching each other. When I was in college, my summer job was being a preschool teacher. I loved it, and after that experience, I said I can't wait to put my kid in day care because I could see how much they loved it.": "Jessica",
  "The whole point of art school is that you're going to be able to have nudes all day long and a teacher who is there to move you. It's great. I did a tiny bit in the one school in Paris, and it was wonderful because you'd have a nude taking a crazy position, and you'd have 10 seconds to do a drawing. Then you'd do a one-minute drawing.": "Lou",
  "I wanted to be Whitney Houston at first, and when I started taking voice lessons, my voice teacher kind of geared me more towards opera.": "Megan",
  "I told my mom the reason I started working out was because I wanted to break the necks of the people picking on me. I wanted to hurt them. I said I didn't want any teacher to put me down any more.": "Herschel",
  "Before Juilliard, I was a schoolteacher for a little bit. I taught in a charter school. I was a substitute teacher for kids ages 3 to 6.": "Samira",
  "Faulkner turned out to be a great teacher. When a student asked a question ineptly, he answered the question with what the student had really wanted to know.": "Leslie",
  "During my own gap year, I learned an invaluable lesson - that I was a lousy teacher. Even though the children I 'taught,' in upcountry Uganda, were desperate for qualifications, they largely ignored me. Until, that is, I realised that they wanted to hear about other young persons around the world.": "Simon",
  "We had a music teacher in sixth grade, and I saw her tune her guitar. I said, 'Whoa. There's a certain way to do this.' I bought a packet of strings - some of mine were broken - and had her tune it for me. For a while, I just kept it like that. But I got the Internet finally, when I was 14, and started learning.": "Brittany",
  "Well, financially it's a little bit better. But it's better than than when I was a teacher. But I kind of - it's allowed me to buy a house. And I've been able to help my mother with some stuff and my brother. So, that's nice.": "Clay",
  "But I was going to be a teacher my entire life, so I wasn't counting on money to much.": "Clay",
  "I had a Spanish teacher in high school. I rarely got in trouble in her room because I felt I was disappointing her if I got a bad grade. That had more power over me than teachers who told me I talked too much. That level of respect I had for her made me not want to fail for her.": "Clay",
  "By continuing to increase teacher recruitment and training - and ameliorating wages and working conditions - we will be able to shore up the weaknesses of the French education system.": "Najat",
  "I worked as a draftsman for the Department of Environmental Protection, and as a teacher, in N.Y.C.; at a big bank and a small ad agency, a tiny law firm and a few giant ones; as a cashier and a dishwasher; preparing deli sandwiches and stringing tennis racquets and pruning evergreens into conical Christmas-tree shapes.": "Chris",
  "It is worth while too to warn the teacher that undue severity in correcting faults is liable at times to discourage a boy's mind from effort.": "Quintilian",
  "I was an educated girl. I'd done very well in school. I had a good point average and graduated from USC as an English teacher. My dad didn't even finish high school.": "Marlo",
  "Experience can be a great teacher.": "Burgess",
  "Unlike other professions - doctor, lawyer, teacher, journalist, sales clerk, stock broker - when a cop makes a bad mistake, it could mean someone is dead. They take home mental baggage unlike anything carried in almost every other job.": "Mike",
  "My mum was a music teacher. I've got three sisters, and we all played instruments when we were kids.": "Tom",
  "I love kids, so two things that I have thought about are being a pediatrician or a kindergarten teacher.": "Karlie",
  "Discussion in class, which means letting twenty young blockheads and two cocky neurotics discuss something that neither their teacher nor they know.": "Vladimir",
  "From a very early age, my wife and I told our son that there are times and places for everything. I told him, look, when you're in class, you have to be quiet and listen to your teacher, but when you go out to the playground, you can scream and be silly.": "Mark",
  "Prior to being allowed to enter the profession, prospective teachers should be asked to talk with a group of friendly students for at least half an hour and be able to engage them in an interesting conversation about any subject the prospective teacher wants to talk about.": "William",
  "In a Glasser Quality School there is no such thing as a closed book test. Students are told to get out their notes and open their books. There is no such thing as being forbidden to ask the teacher or another student for help.": "William",
  "I think if I hadn't been a writer, I'd have been a teacher like my dad. He was a college professor, and one of my greatest regrets is that he passed away before I was able to prove to him that I wasn't going to be stuck working at Rax Roast Beef for the rest of my life!": "Meg",
  "When I first came to Los Angeles, I was a teacher in Compton. I know how in need schools are around the country.": "Kym",
  "My father was my trainer, my teacher. He was closer to my sister in the sense that she adored him and he adored her. He was more like my pal. Because of the 13-year gap, I think by the time I came along, it wasn't a big deal. I wasn't spoilt or cherished, I was just put to work.": "Felicity",
  "I was about nine years old when a teacher administered my IQ test. Unfortunately, as I was nine, I didn't know that I needed to keep the paperwork for future reference.": "Walter",
  "Maybe I was unpopular a bit because I was a teacher's pet. But even the teachers complained about me. They would say to my parents, 'For every one question any pupil asks, Walter asks 10.'": "Walter",
  "People who study the way religions develop have shown that if you have a charismatic teacher, and you don't have an institution develop around that teacher within about a generation to transmit succession within the group, the movement just dies.": "Elaine",
  "I study religion because I find it fascinating and problematic. But I struggle with the idea of what religion is, what being religious means. A lot of people assume that if you write about early Christianity, you must be some kind of Sunday-school teacher.": "Elaine",
  "I've gone to prom multiple times, had fights with the principal, a relationship with my teacher. When people ask if I wish I had gone to high school, I tell them that I've acted all of that stuff out, and it just doesn't seem like fun.": "Britt",
  "My father was a GP; my mother was a teacher and amateur actress. My father was a bit of a storyteller, but the acting influence must have been from her - yes, put it down to my mother.": "Ciaran",
  "I had an excellent math and physics teacher in high school named T.C. Patel, and in the university, I had truly dedicated professors in both physics and mathematics who gave me a sound foundation with which to pursue graduate studies.": "Venkatraman",
  "I saw myself as a teacher's pet but with a little of Ed Haskell mixed in. I was the teacher's pet, but that didn't mean that I was trying to pull one over.": "Damon",
  "My first true lesson in writing came from Mr. Bowden when I was 16. At my high school, he was the teacher known to be the very best at literature and writing.": "Jeff",
  "When people lack teachers, their tendencies are not corrected; when they do not have ritual and moral principles, then their lawlessness is not controlled.": "Xun",
  "I hope that I serve by being a teacher.": "Jenna",
  "As a teacher you can see the difference in kids who have parents who were involved. That difference, by the time these kids get to the third grade, is drastic.": "Jenna",
  "I never wore a tie voluntarily, even though I was forced to wear one for photos when I was young and for official events at school. I used to wrap my tie in a newspaper, and whenever the teacher checked I would quickly put it on again. I'm not used to it. Most Bolivians don't wear ties.": "Evo",
  "If you lock me in the room with a piano teacher for a year I might be able to knock out a rendition of 'Roll Out The Barrel,' but will I ever be a concert pianist? No.": "Alan",
  "I like to be at a party and be a quiet observer, be in conversation. I wouldn't say I was a class clown growing up, but I would definitely sit back in class and take snipes at the teacher.": "Eric",
  "I was a hyperactive kid, and it took awhile for me to find the right teacher. My master was a Shaolin kung fu teacher, but he also taught tai chi, Chinese medicine, brush painting - he was adept at all facets of Chinese culture.": "Daniel",
  "As a teacher I realize that what one learns in school doesn't serve for very much at all, that the only thing one can really learn is self-understanding, and this is something that can't be taught.": "Laura",
  "I remember telling my creative writing teacher that you never want to have a journal, because if you lose it, then someone's going to know all your secrets. And then she stopped using a journal, but I always write everything down... Anytime I travel, I try and fill up notepads.": "Garrett",
  "I had a public school education - 3,000 kids when I was there. And there were a lot of teachers who would just sit there. You'd come in and sign your name and the teacher would just sit there at the head of the class and you would literally just have to stay in your seat for 40 minutes and that was the only thing you'd have to do in class.": "Casey",
  "My folks were busy. My dad was a teacher, and it was during the Second World War, and my mother was working. So I got my stories from films and books. I read a lot, and I love to read to this day.": "Robert",
  "Of course, MIT was notable not just for its faculty but also for its students. And, facing such extremely bright kids as a rookie teacher was something like being thrown to the wolves.": "Eric",
  "My parents were not affluent people and were not - didn't come from the extremities of education. My mother had a high school diploma. I often think I so wish she'd come out of the hills in Appalachia and been able to go on to college. I think she would have made a wonderful teacher.": "Dwight",
  "When I was in junior high, a foreign-history teacher started a theater class. So I got my feet wet there and through high school, so I was very fascinated with acting as a means of expression.": "Dwight",
  "Over my life as a teacher, women have been too quiet. I'm quiet myself. I don't think I said three words the whole of graduate school.": "Marilynne",
  "When I was in college, I had the good fortune to have Joyce Carol Oates as my writing teacher. She told me that I could take an aspect of myself, and from that one bit of personality, I can create a character. This is what I have done, particularly in my novels.": "Jonathan",
  "My dance teacher will show me pictures of girls who are rhythmic gymnasts, and they are super skinny. But I don't want to be too skinny. I think that looks a little gross when you are dancing. You don't want to be a scrawny, bony thing.": "Maddie",
  "I often think that the prime directive for me as a teacher of writing is akin to that for a physician, which is this: do no harm.": "Chang-Rae",
  "I tell my son Corey that the greatest teacher is the teacher who says, 'Don't follow me; follow yourself. Because within you there is that kingdom, that life, that force.'": "Billy",
  "I made my drama teacher cry. I only took drama to get out of writing papers in English and the teacher was this thespian Broadway geek and here I was this Italian guy from Staten Island and I would put her in tears.": "Vinny",
  "If you love dance and you have the gift of teaching, teaching is super amazing and important because my teachers planted that seed in me. As a teacher you understand the difference or the definition of a Baryshnikov or a Gregory Hines, so teaching is really important and very necessary.": "Laurieann",
  "I'm just not a natural teacher.": "David",
  "I had gone to New York with no plan at all. I did a lot of jobs - barman, teacher, security guard, postman and construction worker - and I was meeting many eccentric characters, and they were saying funny things, which I always wrote down.": "Adrian",
  "I had a teacher in college who drastically changed the course of my life by telling me that he believed in me as an actor. I never received that support before, and it inspired to me to such a degree that I never looked back. He taught me that it's okay to be crappy; it's okay to fight; it's okay to go to any length.": "Taylor",
  "I wanted to be a ballet teacher.": "Jaclyn",
  "I had this wonderful career and thought I would retire as a teacher.": "Tim",
  "If you told me when I was a teen that I would end up being a teacher, I would have said you're out of your mind, because quite frankly I hated school.": "Tim",
  "I wanted to be a teacher. I love children, so I wanted to deal with children. Then I wanted to be a veterinarian. But by the age of ten or eleven, when I opened my mouth and said, 'Oh, God, what's this?' I kind of knew teaching and being a veterinarian were gonna have to wait.": "Whitney",
  "Muriel, my mother, was my main confidant. She was a teacher of English at Watford grammar school but took a break while my sister Madeleine and I were children. She held court in the kitchen, and we talked about everything.": "John",
  "My history teacher could make us feel like he was imparting rare gossip to us when he was talking about Maria Theresa and the Habsburgs. I just loved that sense of - the Western canon is here, and it's gossipy and tawdry, and everyone is sort of goofy.": "Mallory",
  "If you are a lousy teacher, you should be fired.": "Geoffrey",
  "As places of learning, schools have a responsibility to also educate on nutrition, which we all can agree is far more important than algebra, no matter what your third-period teacher claims.": "Lynda",
  "The wonderful drama teacher at my high school, Barbara Patterson, saw me standing in the hall and told me I should audition for 'West Side Story.' I guess she thought I looked like a gang member.": "Gary",
  "I was never one to go up to someone as a five- or six-year-old and say, 'Hello, my name's Paul, will you be my friend?' But I found if I did an impression of the PE teacher or whatever and people laughed, then they did like me, and so then they started talking to me, rather than me making the initial overture and then maybe being rebuffed.": "Paul",
  "You know, I loved math. My mom was a math teacher.": "Joan",
  "A father is a person who's around, participating in a child's life. He's a teacher who helps to guide and shape and mold that young person, someone for that young person to talk to, to share with, their ups and their downs, their fears and their concerns.": "Michael",
  "You know, a football coach is nothing more than a teacher. You teach them the same subject, and you have a group of new guys every year.": "Darrell",
  "Every man who rises above the common level has received two educations: the first from his teachers; the second, more personal and important, from himself.": "Edward",
  "Jesse Jackson is a leader and a teacher who can open our hearts and open our minds and stir our very souls.": "Ann",
  "We may have forgotten how to feel. Nobody is teaching us how to live happily ever after, as we've heard in fairy tales.": "Yakov",
  "We need to do teacher training to educate them about what temperament means. Shyness is painful and you want to help a child with shyness - but the underlying temperament of being a careful, sensitive person is to be honoured, valued and respected.": "Susan",
  "I started elocution lessons because I was being teased, and I had a brilliant drama teacher. At the age of 14, I appeared at the National Theatre in 'The Crucible.'": "Gina",
  "I tried to stir the imagination and enthusiasms of students to take risks, to do what they were most afraid of doing, to widen their horizons of action.": "James",
  "We know the parental support, community support, makes a difference. It's not just the metrics of testing and putting pressure on the schools and on the teachers.": "Donna",
  "I was 20 years old, working as a roofer and a telemarketer and driving a taxi, just barely getting by. A friend of a friend suggested I try acting. I was like, 'Why? What am I going to do? Community theater?' But I took a class, and the teacher thought that I had potential, so I moved to Vancouver and started auditioning.": "Cory",
  "Children are already accustomed to a world that moves faster and is more exciting than anything a teacher in front of a classroom can do.": "Major",
  "We can not wait until we have enough trained people willing to work at a teacher's salary and under conditions imposed upon teachers in order to improve what happens in the classroom.": "Major",
  "When I was 16, I was taught by a wonderful teacher who let me ignore the Greek syllabus and just read Homer.": "Alice",
  "I have a deal with HBO to develop television, and I am also developing a movie called 'The Abstinence Teacher,' which is based on a book by Tom Perrotta.": "Lisa",
  "I've never considered myself a celebrity or even part of the entertainment business. I'm a cooking teacher.": "Martin",
  "Once I accomplish one thing and I'm satisfied, I try something else. I may be 50 and doing something totally outside of music and acting. Maybe I'll become a kindergarten teacher.": "Kid",
  "My kindergarten teacher encouraged me to learn, as did my school headmaster, who gave me a grant to study.": "Ada",
  "I initially wanted to be a teacher, and then I was going to become an engineer and build bridges and highways, but pretty soon I went into the business world. I never did get to be a teacher except in a different way.": "Louis",
  "As a teacher, my strategy is to encourage questioning. I'm the least authoritarian professor you'll ever meet.": "Niall",
  "I worked as a secretary, a waitress and a dance teacher - all in high school.": "Jennie",
  "You don't want to engage in road rage when the person in the next car might be your child's future teacher or your dentist's father.": "Kim",
  "My mother was told she couldn't go to medical school because she was a woman and a Jew. So she became a teacher in the New York City public school system.": "Marilyn",
  "As a teacher you are more or less obliged to pay the same amount of attention to everything. That can wear you down.": "Marilyn",
  "I think my parents were happy that I'd gone to university and gotten a degree in history so they thought, 'Well if acting doesn't work for him, he can always become a history teacher or something.' Fortunately, the acting worked out.": "Derek",
  "I want to be involved with young people in some way. Teenagers. Because that's the most vulnerable time. I have a fantasy of becoming a teacher one day.": "Elisabeth",
  "My mum is a school teacher and my dad is an electrician.": "Jai",
  "I not only couldn't read but often couldn't hear or understand what was being said to me - by the time I'd processed the beginning of a sentence, the teacher was well on her way through a second or third.": "Philip",
  "As a poet and a teacher, I read all the time. I know I read slowly. I like reading, but I don't read any more than I have to.": "Philip",
  "The first responsibility of the Muslim is as teacher. That is his job, to teach. His first school, his first classroom is within the household. His first student is himself. He masters himself and then he begins to convey the knowledge that he has acquired to the family. The people who are closest to him.": "H.",
  "My father is a teacher my mother was a telecom employee. I come from Palermo I was raised in Ethiopia. I am homosexual. I didn't go to film school. ": "Luca",
  "I don't learn so good, no matter how good the teacher is.": "Warren",
  "My parents always knew that I loved music. They just didn't think I'd try to make it a career. They thought I'd be a painter or an art teacher or something like that.": "Benmont",
  "I was the one that was always dancing and got along with everybody, but I also spoke my mind. If I didn't agree with something the teacher would say, I'd tell her, so I would get in trouble for things like that. I've always been a good/bad boy.": "Shameik",
  "In business, experience is the big teacher.": "Matthew",
  "As a teacher, as a propagandist, Mr. Shaw is no good at all, even in his own generation. But as a personality, he is immortal.": "Max",
  "My favorite English teacher in high school showed me 'Brazil' when I was 15, and it blew my mind. It's one of those movies that's revealed itself in different ways as I've gone back to it over the years.": "Win",
  "I don't find acting to be a particularly noble way to make a living. I'm not saving anybody's life, I'm not a teacher, I'm not working for UNICEF. I don't think I'm some big deal.": "Ellen",
  "My humanitarian work evolved from being with my family. My mom, my dad, they really set a great example for giving back. My mom was a nurse, my dad was a school teacher. But my mom did a lot of things for geriatrics and elderly people. She would do home visits for free.": "Cat",
  "I had my heart set on becoming an English teacher, but stumbled into acting after meeting a theatrical agent in my dad's restaurant in San Diego.": "Charisma",
  "I would take William H. Macy as a teacher any day of the week. He's incredible. He's got a lot of hard-earned experience.": "Skeet",

  "I grew up in such a musical family, and my dad was the first chair in the Johannesburg Symphony Orchestra, and my mom was a piano teacher and a painter, so it was kind of a creative environment, and it was kind of in my DNA.": "Trevor",
  "I think that when you're queer, you grow up with these kinds of men who might have made you feel small because of who you are. They could be part of your family, or somebody on the street, or a teacher.": "Ben",

Later I would travel almost 70 kms to the nearest town, Kota, to learn music from my guru Mahesh Sharmaji, who was also the principal of the music college there.": "Shreya",
  "Literature is my life of course, but from an ontological point of view. From an existential point of view, I like being a teacher.": "Antonio",

  "My father still is a lawyer, and my mom was a teacher and then later a career counselor.": "Steve",
  "I had a really creative teacher at primary school. He used to get us doing things such as singing Spandau Ballet in drag in the choir, and I remember loving it.": "Dominic",
  "I was a teacher most of my life, which I loved. I had a very happy working life, and when I retired, I thought I must do something, and I've always read a lot of fiction - you learn so much from fiction. My sentimental education came mostly from fiction, I should say, so I thought I'd try.": "Anita",
  "I'm very involved with kids because after being a teacher for seven years, I just can't stop loving the kids. I am a teacher forever.": "Yolanda",

  "A teacher should have maximal authority, and minimal power.": "Thomas",
  "I first started going to shows when I was about 16 - seeing local bands. I mean, I loved music before that, and I played a bit of guitar when I was younger and thought maybe I'd become a guitar teacher or something, but when I saw other kids doing it, I was like, 'Whoa, these are great bands! I can do it, too.'": "Mac",
  "I went to a Catholic high school and it seemed like every time I drew something for a class project, it either got thrown away by the teacher or something.": "Mike",
  "When I was a teacher, teachers would come into my classroom and admire my desk on which lay nothing whatever, whereas theirs were heaped with papers and books.": "Norman",

  "I could never have a better teacher in those days than my father.": "Tony",
  "Writing became an obsessive compulsive habit but I had almost no money so I thought about being an urban firefighter and having lots of free time in which to write or becoming an English teacher and thinking about books and writers on a daily basis. That swayed me.": "David",
  "Ask everyone whether they're an actor or a doctor or a teacher or whatever is entitled to his or her opinion. But unfortunately, because actors are in the public eye, whether we want it or not, sometimes our opinions carry more weight or influence than they deserve.": "Debra",
  "I feel really good in the teacher role.": "Jimmy",
  "My mother wanted to be a teacher when she was young, and my father didn't approve of it, so she fought very hard to become one. And she did it. So when I said I wanted to become an actress, my mother was very supportive. She always said to me, 'There's no such thing as 'can't.'": "Archie",

  "My high school English teacher in junior year, Dr. Robert Parsons, assigned us some Poe stories, including 'The Black Cat' and 'The Purloined Letter.' Being an animal person, I had trouble with 'The Black Cat!' I got hooked instead by 'The Purloined Letter,' a Poe story with detective C. Auguste Dupin.": "Matthew",
  "It is hardly an exaggeration to say that oral teachers and sign teachers found it difficult to sit down in the same room without quarreling, and there was intolerance upon both sides. To say 'oral method' to a sign teacher was like waving a red flag in the face of a bull, and to say 'sign language' to an oralist aroused the deepest resentment.": "Alexander",
  "I wasn't originally taking drama, but the drama teacher asked me to audition for Bye, Bye Birdie. I did and got the lead role. Initially I was kind of scared, but once I did it I got bitten by the bug and loved it.": "Kevin",
  "I wanted to be what my high-school civics and history teacher thought of as a good American. That automatically involved taking an interest in government.": "Olivia",

  "My first career was as a coach and a teacher.": "David",

  "Whether you're an obstetrician or a third-grade teacher or a real estate agent, you know when you're doing good work. You're passionate about it.": "Susan",
  "Any writing teacher tells you to write what you know, and for better or for worse, Washington is a world I know well.": "Kristin",
  "I'd like to say I was smart enough to finish six grades in five years, but I think perhaps the teacher was just glad to get rid of me.": "Alan",
  "I went to a school called Tring Park School for the Performing Arts. I went because initially I was very naughty, and my mom thought if I was busy, I'd be better. And I didn't really do acting until later on in the school, with an amazing teacher. I left, went traveling, came back.": "Daisy",
  "If you ask me about vocal technique, I don't know anything. I could never be a teacher. I just know what my teacher told me: 'Always sing with a full voice. When they tell you, less sound, more piano - no.'": "Anna",
  "No matter how much you like your local school teacher, he or she is a government agent.": "Nancy",
  "A woman of faith is fearless. There is no ambiguity, no uncertain trump in her life. She can live a principled life because she studies the doctrine and teachings of a perfect teacher, the Master. She is a noble example to all who know her.": "Margaret",
  "When I started writing full time I had not long stopped being a teacher and when at last I had a full day to write, I would put music on and wonder to myself - am I allowed to do this? Then I thought: 'I am control of this and no one is telling me what I can do.'": "Roddy",
  "My history teacher was utterly terrifying, but her lessons were very inspiring. She got me interested in people and stories, which then led me to acting.": "Laura",
  "A mentor, a 'teacher,' is like an editor. I absolutely value my editor, who is my teacher.": "David",
  "My parents wanted me to be a teacher. Because I could work most of the year and pursue the things that I love to do during the summer. It just seemed like a good plan.": "Kate",
  "I was on Oprah's show recently talking about the people who impacted me the most. One was a teacher and one was my soccer coach. I didn't even go into my family, who had the most influence.": "Andrew",
  "The fact of the matter is that when there are feelings involved and you like someone, it doesn't matter if you're an actor, a teacher, a doctor, a lawyer, a receptionist - you can't really help it when you have feelings for someone.": "Jessica",

  "In high school, my English teacher Celeste McMenamin introduced me to the great novels and Shakespeare and taught me how to write. Essays, poetry, critical analysis. Writing is a skill that was painful then but a love of mine now.": "Aaron",
  "Christine Bass was my high school music teacher. She took a program on its last legs and within a few years turned into one of the best programs in the country. Our high school dominated national choir competitions all through her 20-plus year tenure.": "Aaron",
  "A wonderful acting teacher I love, Josh Pais, has a system I love for being in the moment in acting, but also in life. And one of the things he reminds me of is to take a moment and just be here now.": "Alysia",
  "I guess by taking lessons early on, and really trying to play all the rudimentary stuff, and try to have it sound as good as my teacher. It took a lot of practice, which I enjoyed, and still do.": "Matt",
  "I decided at age 9, but I was reinforced at age 13 when a teacher told me I had talent. I can't say she really motivated me because I already knew. I knew I had talent. I went to the Jewish community theater and got in plays there. Then I went for the movies.'": "Richard",
  "If I wasn't an actor, I'd be a teacher, a history teacher. After all, teaching is very much like performing. A teacher is an actor, in a way. It takes a great deal to get, and hold, a class.": "Richard",
  "My dad remembers being in school with my uncle, and the teacher would say outright to the class that the Japanese were second-class citizens and shouldn't be trusted.": "Mike",
  "I never did very well in math - I could never seem to persuade the teacher that I hadn't meant my answers literally.": "Calvin",
  "My father was a teacher, and there were teachers all around, his friends, they were working for the Government and their behaviour was within strictly limited areas.": "C.",
  "I see myself as an old man and an unqualified teacher to the nation. I think being a teacher is probably the most important thing you can be in politics.": "Tony",
  "The Spirit of the Holy Ghost is the teacher in the temple. He teaches principles of eternal significance. It is during these instructions that we see the relationship between the earthly and the eternal. We must remember that the Spirit teaches only those who are teachable.": "L.",
  "I wanted to be a teacher, but I was a lousy student, one of the slowest readers. It was a tremendous struggle. But I'm lucky I had some teachers who saw something in me.": "Ann",
  "A great teacher who is full of excitement and love for her students can make all the difference in their lives.": "Deval",
  "I first decided to become an actor at school. A teacher gave us a play to do and that had a major impact. At first, I wanted to work in the theatre, but there was something about the ambience of film, especially American films, that always attracted me.": "Jean",
  "I know I have this kind of teaching element in me, but I don't want to become a 'teacher of theater' because that would formalize something that I'd much rather keep casual.": "Richard",

  "I had a ninth grade teacher who told me I was much smarter and much better than I was allowing myself to be.": "Scott",

  "Mike Watt and I had the same teacher. Mr. Tanaka.": "Krist",
  "Find a good teacher, as I found for my sons. I feel the worst thing you can do is to try and teach your own children yourself, because there is a natural rebellion that occurs.": "Keith",
  "My father's a preacher, my mother's a teacher, thus I rhyme.": "Saul",
  "I was a theater dork in high school and did all the plays. My theater teacher in high school, Janet Spahr, was absolutely incredible and mentored me throughout school. She taught me a lot about relying on my instincts.": "Melissa",
  "My first acting job happened by accident when I was really young. I was in fifth grade and my teacher saw an ad in the paper and took me to the audition after school and I got the part.": "Ajay",
  "I started the class late. The teacher said I would have to learn as much in half a year that the others learned in a year. I did it.": "Katarina",
  "I remember I used to come up to my teacher crying because I couldn't read. She would say: 'You can do this. You just don't want to do this.'": "Max",
  "I was 11 when a teacher suggested to my parents that they should send me to drama classes to curb my disruptive ways in the classroom. The next Saturday I was acting, and thereafter it became a ritual of my youth to see a show at the Belvoir on Sundays and, if I was lucky, another at the Opera House on Monday after school.": "David",
  "My very beloved and deceased third-grade teacher, Cliff Kehod, was the one that I really remember calling me Ike a lot. It just stuck. It is a dog's name, but I love dogs.": "Ike",
  "Sincerity is the norm of Heaven and the law of our nature. China and the West agree on this point, for without sincerity, no human prince could ever found a state, and no earthly teacher could ever establish a religion.": "Zhang",
  "Raphael Saadiq said to me, quite often, that Chuck D was his history teacher. And so he got a lot from the music, things that he wasn't getting maybe in school. And I feel the same way with regards to Earth, Wind & Fire, Stevie Wonder.": "Ali",
  "Given my age, I am pretty near the end, probably, of my career as a writer, a scholar, a teacher. And I wanted to speak of things I will not be able to do.": "George",

  "I thought I'd grow up to be a teacher, or maybe run for political office.": "Jake",
  "Teacher compensation isn't the only factor in cultivating great teaching. Other important priorities include changing how we measure student performance, providing more flexibility to teacher-preparation programs, and improving how we train and support principals.": "Michael",
  "My time at the Denver Public Schools taught me there is no harder, or more important, job than being a teacher.": "Michael",
  "I believe there's not a harder job in the world than being a teacher, and there isn't a job with a more direct impact on the performance of our students.": "Michael",

  "How well I walk my talk, and not talk my talk, determines the quality of my engagement, of all my experience with what is quite personally my God. I'm my greatest teacher, and within me, I have the power to push myself deeper and higher.": "Lorraine",
  "There was an email forwarded to me from a first-grade teacher, and she said she was teaching them civil rights for MLK weekend, and a little first-grader stood up, and he said, 'I can explain segregation,' and proceeded to explain all the scenes from 'Hidden Figures.' And I died because that's everything.": "Allison",
  "I was an elementary school teacher.": "Luciano",

  "One of the most extraordinary things about being a spiritual teacher is the rare privilege of being able to look deeply into the very souls of many human beings at the same time.": "Andrew",
  "My mother was a P.E. teacher, and she was kind of a fanatic about fitness and nutrition growing up, so it was ingrained in me at a young age. As I get older, I'm finding out it's not about getting all buffed up and looking good. It's more about staying healthy and flexible.": "Josh",
  "I always wanted to be a teacher. I went to school to be a teacher. And I've always, you know, had this sort of romantic idea about it. But I'm worried about - I'm worried about education.": "Tony",
  "I'm very grateful and fully aware that 90 percent of actors are not working. Going from public school teacher to a show like 'Grey's Anatomy', I love what I do.": "Jesse",
  "What happened is, when I was doing 'Taxi,' the last year, we did this thing where we had on top hats and tails, and we pretended to tap-dance. And I said to myself, 'You know, I always wanted to know how to do this.' So I got myself a teacher, and I started studying, and I got hooked.": "Tony",
  "The second, and I think this is the much more overt and I think it is the main cause, I have been increasingly demonstrating or trying to demonstrate that every possible stance a critic, a scholar, a teacher can take towards a poem is itself inevitably and necessarily poetic.": "Harold",
  "I think that school just isn't for everyone. A lot of people don't learn well when they're - have to sit in a place for eight hours. A lot of people learn best lying in their own bed, teaching themselves from books. And I was a bad student. I was a brat. If I was a teacher, I would not have liked myself.": "Molly",
  "It was difficult being a teacher and out of the closet in the '50s. By the time I retired, the English department was proud of having a gay poet of a certain minor fame. It was a very satisfactory change!": "Thom",
  "My old teacher's definition of poetry is an attempt to understand.": "Thom",
  "The office of the public teacher is an unenviable and thankless one.": "Felix",
  "I was going to get a degree in economics and be a teacher. But I couldn't afford to pay for the education. So I just got the MBA and not the doctorate. I loved it at Bain, and I've been there ever since.": "Stephen",

  "My sister is an ER doctor, and my brother is a teacher.": "Rami",

  "Some of my high school teachers did remind me that I had an excellent imagination when it came to making up excuses.": "David",
  "I was a teacher for a long time. I taught at a community college: voice, theory, humanities. And nowadays, music education is a dying thing. Funding is being cut more and more and more.": "Jon",
  "I love doing demonstrations. I think to be a great chef you have to be a great teacher. I love doing classes with people who love food and enjoy food, bringing them all around one table so to speak.": "Michael",
  "I've always written. When I was in school, the only teacher who ever liked me was my creative writing teacher. I used to enter poetry competitions, and I don't think I ever lost one. So I had the idea for a while of being some kind of poet.": "Justin",

  "Whether you're working in corporate America or you're a journalist, construction worker, a teacher or an actor - we're all trying to keep working. If one job is ending, you look for another job. When 'Psych' ends, I will be looking for another job.": "Dule",

  "When I was 16, I played Macbeth at school and my English teacher said, 'I think you may have acting talent. Try to get into the National Youth Theatre of Great Britain and see where you get.' I wouldn't have thought of that at all. I wanted to be a surgeon, but I wasn't a clever man.": "David",
  "Teachers believe they have a gift for giving it drives them with the same irrepressible drive that drives others to create a work of art or a market or a building. ": "A.",
  "I had a great drama teacher, and he sort of made out drama school as this incredibly difficult thing to get into: 6,000 people apply every year, and some of the schools only have 12 places. It's a phenomenally difficult thing to get into. And that excited me - I wanted that challenge.": "Jeremy",
  "But I think that any young drummer starting out today should get himself a great teacher and learn all there is to know about the instrument that he wants to play.": "Buddy",
  "Then I heard this genius teacher Stella Adler - I recommend you read anything you might find about her and if you have anyone interested in theatre, you get them one of her books.": "Harvey",
  "I had an art teacher who's the reason I got there in high school who encouraged me to go to Alabama. That's where she had gone and kept raving over their art department.": "Sela",
  "The message of music was also the first thing what I learned from my first teacher. She was an organist too and she was very devoted to what she played, so she had a respect for every piece and she felt that she is not allowed to add something of her own.": "Kurt",
  "I remember my fourth grade teacher reading 'Charlotte's Web' and 'Stuart Little' to us - both, of course, by E. B. White. His stories were genuinely funny, thought provoking and full of irony and charm. He didn't condescend to his readers, which was why I liked his books, and why I wasn't a big reader of other children's' books.": "Louis",
  "Delayed gratification is a sweet lesson whose teacher knows the best is not right now, it is yet to be.": "Maximillian",
  "What it takes is to actually write: not to think about it, not to imagine it, not to talk about it, but to actually want to sit down and write. I'm lucky I learned that habit a really long time ago. I credit my mother with that. She was an English teacher, but she was a writer.": "Luanne",
  "As a teacher myself I've been in situations where parents come at you, and sometimes parents come across like the teacher doesn't want the best for their kid and it can be really, really hurtful.": "Rosalind",
  "Openness is something any teacher strives to instill in his or her students.": "Chris",
  "To learn to ride a bicycle, as with the other great noble human inventions, is a hugely complex activity. Generally, it requires three things: the learner, the teacher and the bicycle, all in the same place at the same time, most often outside someplace.": "Chris",
  "Instead of five hundred thousand average algebra teachers, we need one good algebra teacher. We need that teacher to create software, videotape themselves, answer questions, let your computer or the iPad teach algebra... The hallmark of any good technology is that it destroys jobs.": "Michael",
  "I like to be loved by my children, and I quite like the 'Guardian' hating me. I like it when I read they want me to die painfully. Then I think I've really got under their skin. It's like annoying a teacher. Once they've shown signs of weakness, you really can go for them.": "Jeremy",
  "My duty as a teacher is to train, educate future programmers.": "Niklaus",
  "I was chubby in high school. I used to go to my information technology class, and I would type really fast to get the lesson done quick because the teacher had a little acoustic guitar, and there was a girl I had a crush on in the class. I would take the guitar and pretend to be some great singer-songwriter, serenade her with joke songs.": "Tobias",
  "Teachers have told us across the country that what's severely outdated is the teacher at the front of the classroom as the font of knowledge, because as we know, access to knowledge and information is now ubiquitous. So instead, teachers want to help students learn how to think so that they can be lifelong learners.": "Laurene",
  "I had a teacher, he was 86 years old and his name was Luigi in New York City, and he said, 'Never stop moving. You get to reinvent yourself.' So you have to find ways to reinventing yourself. Especially today, because it's a whole different market - social media is so important.": "Ben",
  "As a student I learned from wonderful teachers and ever since then I've thought everyone is a teacher.": "Bill",
  "I had a teacher when I was in college, and he was the first person who liked my photos and said, 'The way you look at girls is your own way of seeing.' He was the first person who really gave me the confidence to try something.": "Sofia",
  "You know how to tell if the teacher is hung over? Movie Day.": "Jay",
  "I always wrote music for my friends, but my focus was on playing piano. I didn't think I'd be quite good enough to be a soloist, but I believed that if I worked hard enough, I could work as a player, a teacher.": "John",
  "Everybody's a teacher if you listen.": "Doris",
  "A friend of mine said, no matter what I do I always look like an English teacher. She actually said, you still look like a Campbell's Soup kid.": "Kate",

  "Americanism demands loyalty to the teacher and respect for his lesson.": "Bainbridge",

  "The impending teacher shortage is the most critical education issue we will face in the next decade.": "David",
  "My mother was an English teacher who decided to become a math teacher, and she used me as a guinea pig at home. My father had been a math teacher and then went to work at a steel mill because, frankly, he could make more money doing that.": "Freeman",

  "Yes, I was actually an acting teacher for a while.": "Alanna",
  "In high school, a teacher's friend in the police department asked me to go into a bar and flash a fake ID saying I was 21 even though I wasn't. They were assuming the bar wasn't carding people. Anyway, she forgot to ask for it back. I used it all freshman year in college.": "Betsy",
  "I can't explain something I saw on holiday on Holy Island when I was about nine years old, but do you know what, it could have been my PE teacher dressed in a monk's habit. I have no idea. I'm not a ghost person... it doesn't mean there aren't unexplained things; I just don't think they're ghosts.": "Tom",
  "I have taught some master classes and things at my alma mater and sometimes at my kids' school. I will go in and talk to the theater students. I wouldn't really call myself a teacher.": "Annie",
  "I had one of those defining moments in the fourth grade when my teacher said the story I wrote was the best in the class, and therefore I would be going Young Authors Conference where I'd get to hang out with authors all day.": "Lisa",
  "I grew up in Rome, in actually what I would say was a liberal, open-minded family. My father was an architect and my mother was a teacher of art history, so it was sort of intellectual, and maybe a bit much for me when I was a child.": "Frida",
  "Dad is in commercial real estate. Mom is a writer and a retired teacher.": "James",
  "While teaching, I also worked undercover in the lower courts by saying I was a young law teacher wanting experience in criminal law. The judges were happy to assist me but what I learned was how corrupt the lower courts were. Judges were accepting money right in the courtroom.": "Samuel",

  "As they work hard for our children, America's teachers often reach into their own pockets to make sure they have the best classroom supplies. I feel strongly that the federal government should help make up for their personal financial burden.": "John",

  "One of the things I've always liked about my husband is he's very good at lots of stuff. He was an English teacher when I met him. He wrote poetry and played the guitar.

  "Evil can be a teacher, if you look at the wisdom of its negative power.": "Tom",
  "A teacher is never too smart to learn from his pupils. But while runners differ, basic principles never change. So it's a matter of fitting your current practices to fit the event and the individual. See, what's good for you might not be worth a darn for the next guy.": "Bill",

  "My life is about ups and downs, great joys and great losses.": "Isabel",
  "Healing yourself is connected with healing others.": "Yoko",
  "Feeling sorry for ourselves is the most useless waste of energy on the planet. It does absolutely no good. We can't let our circumstances or what others do or don't do control us. We can decide to be happy regardless.": "Joyce",
  "Forget the past.": "Nelson",

  "A man never knows how to say goodbye a woman never knows when to say it. ": "Helen",
  "The world is a crazy, beautiful, ugly complicated place, and it keeps moving on from crisis to strangeness to beauty to weirdness to tragedy.

  "The goal of spiritual practice is full recovery, and the only thing you need to recover from is a fractured sense of self.": "Marianne",

  "The all-seeing eye of God beheld our deplorable state infinite pity touched the heart of the Father of mercies and infinite wisdom laid the plan of our recovery. ": "David",
  "I'm pretty horrible at relationships and haven't been in many long-term ones. Leaving and moving on - returning to a familiar sense of self-reliance and autonomy - is what I know that feeling is as comfortable and comforting as it might be for a different kind of person to stay. ": "Carrie",
  "I can still love an ex as a person, regardless if the breakup was bad. I would never wish anything negative on them. It takes more energy to hate them than to wish them well.": "Ashley",

  "I can enjoy anywhere, and I can leave it. Life is about moving on.": "Waris",
  "Part of growing up is just taking what you learn from that and moving on and not taking it to heart.": "Beverley",
  "I have more of a desire to write songs about being an independent woman than being in love, songs about getting up and moving on even if I have a broken heart. 'Wanna Say' is one of the few love songs I've ever done.": "Kat",

  "I mean, don't forget the earth's about five thousand million years old, at least. Who can afford to live in the past?": "Harold",
  "Getting over someone is a grieving process. You mourn the loss of the relationship, and that's only expedited by 'Out of sight, out of mind.'

  "What's that line from TS Eliot? To arrive at the place where you started, but to know it for the first time. I'm able to write about a breakup from a different place. Same brokenness. Same rock-bottom. But a little more informed, now I'm older. Thank God for growing up.": "Alanis",
  "Any time you end a relationship, and everyone has ended plenty in their life, it's always a tough thing and hard to get over.": "Adam",

  "Many of us are experiencing a phase of change, shedding outdated patterns and liberating ourselves from the old by moving on to the new.

  "Poesy must not be drawn by the ears: it must be gently led, or rather, it must lead, which was partly the cause that made the ancient learned affirm it was a divine, and no human skill, since all other knowledges lie ready for any that have strength of wit; a poet no industry can make, if his own genius be not carried into it.": "Philip",

  "In all human affairs there are efforts, and there are results, and the strength of the effort is the measure of the result.": "James",

  "Tennis takes care of everything. It requires agility and quickness to get to the ball, core strength to get power into your shorts and stamina to last for an entire match.

  "My faith is an important part of my life and over the years I've learnt that it takes a proud man to say he doesn't need anything. It has been a quiet strength and a backbone through a lot of difficult times.": "Bear",

  "It isn't right to judge strength as better than good wisdom.": "Xenophanes",
  "India is a vibrant nation whose strength lies in its commitment to equal rights and to speech, religious and economic freedoms that enrich the lives of all citizens. India is not only the world's largest democracy; it is also a secular, pluralistic society committed to inclusive growth.": "Henry",
  "I'm not against working out. It's just not effective for weight loss. I like strength training to tone and firm the body so you look tight. But working out just makes you hungrier.": "Jorge",

  "The lesson of 9/11 is that America is truly exceptional. We withstood the worst attack of our history, intended by our enemies to destroy us. Instead, it drew us closer and made us more united. Our love for freedom and one another has given us a strength that surprised even ourselves.": "Rudy",
  "The malaria parasite has been killing children and sapping the strength of whole populations for tens of thousands of years. It is impossible to calculate the harm malaria has done to the world.": "Bill",

  "Part of my advantage is that my strength is economic forecasting, but that only works in free markets, when markets are smarter than people. That's how I started. I watched the stock market, how equities reacted to change in levels of economic activity, and I could understand how price signals worked and how to forecast them.": "Stanley",
  "Most people are remarkably resilient. Even those who have been through war or great loss often find reservoirs of strength. But the legacy of trauma is a heavy burden to bear.": "Christina",

  "When it comes to tyrants, dictators and terrorists, strength and the threat of force is the only language they understand.": "Kevin",
  "I believe in the Prince of Peace. I believe that War is Murder.

  "Germany's strength lies largely in the fact that the Federal Republic is a center of industry and that it's an export nation.": "Angela",
  "It's a marathon, not a sprint. I actually feel like I come to work stronger when I've had a little time on the weekend to step away from it and enjoy my family and other things.

  "Having the strength to tune out negativity and remain focused on what I want gives me the will and confidence to achieve my goals.": "Gisele",

  "The carrying power of a bridge is not the average strength of the pillars, but the strength of the weakest pillar. I have always believed that you do not measure the health of a society by GNP but by the condition of its worst off.": "Zygmunt",
  "Freedom comes from strength and self-reliance.": "Lisa",
  "This is just what I have thought when I have seen slaves at work - they seem to go through the motions of labor without putting strength into them. They keep their powers in reserve for their own use at night, perhaps.": "Frederick",

  "One thing I learned about Gordon Brown is you've got to have the strength to just get in there and take him on. When you first hear him spouting his statistics and boasting about his record, it can be quite intimidating. But over time, shadowing him, I just realised that a lot of it was rubbish; a lot of it was baloney.": "George",
  "How can we love the Lord our God with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength if we must separate our minds from our faith? Such a separation violates the very meaning of faith.": "Hugh",

So for me, whatever I've gone through had profoundly shaped me; it has given me strength and unwavering faith.": "Alek",
  "I think the key to beautiful, frizz-free curls in the summer is to keep hair healthy.

It definitely gives my whole summer look a new life!": "Jillian",
  "I can make all the throws. My mental side is a strength as far as understanding defense schemes and our playbook. I'm able to change plays when needed. I think that sets me apart.": "Carson",

  "Too often the strong, silent man is silent only because he does not know what to say, and is reputed strong only because he has remained silent.": "Winston",
  "I read everything, but generally more fact than fiction - especially autobiographies and biographies. I've read 'Long Walk to Freedom' by Nelson Mandela at least twice on holiday. Every time, I'm totally awed by his vision, strength and forgiveness. I feel honoured to have got to know him and his wonderful wife Graca over the years.": "Richard",
  "Although men are accused of not knowing their own weakness, yet perhaps few know their own strength. It is in men as in soils, where sometimes there is a vein of gold which the owner knows not of.": "Jonathan",

  "Billie Holiday, Aretha Franklin. Now, they are so subtle, they can milk you with two notes. They can make you feel like they told you the whole universe. But I don't know that yet. All I got now is strength. Maybe if I keep singing, maybe I'll get it.": "Janis",

  "I've been through it all, baby, I'm mother courage.": "Elizabeth",
  "I'm very sensitive about the fact that there's not a lot of good work for women in cinema that also deals with strong characters. But 'strong character' doesn't mean 'masculine character' - but something that finds the strength in femininity and the beauty in femininity. And something that says you can find femininity in men in some way.": "Denis",
  "We will naturally pursue our goals on the strength of our own resources, skills and enterprise. But, we know that we will be more successful when we do this in partnership with the world.": "Narendra",
  "Sacrifice, discipline and prayer are essential. We gain strength through God's word. We receive grace from the sacrament. And when we fumble due to sin - and it's gonna happen - confession puts us back on the field.": "Lou",

  "For me, the perfect romantic suspense hero has got to be tough on the outside but tender at his core.

I mean, he might bend the law if he thinks the ends justify the means.": "Ruth",
  "It took me a really long time to decide who I want my circle to be and who I want to surround myself with. Once you make that choice, that is where I feel like I have built my strength.

  "If our nation goes over a financial Niagara, we won't have much strength and, eventually, we won't have peace. We are currently borrowing the entire defense budget from foreign investors. Within a few years, we will be spending more on interest payments than on national security. That is not, as our military friends say, a 'robust strategy.'": "Mitch",

  "I talk a lot about strength, faith and love, but I don't ever talk about the fact that I am one of the most sensitive people in my family. That might be the most shocking, because you always see me fighting the good fight, with the strong face on, but I am the most emotional.": "Monica",

  "If you have other gods before the Lord, your heart will be turned away from serving the only true and living God, who requires the whole heart, the undivided affections.

  "Increased spiritual strength is a gift from God which He can give when we push in His service to our limits. Through the power of the Atonement of Jesus Christ, our natures can be changed. Then our power to carry burdens can be increased more than enough to compensate for the increased service we will be asked to give.": "Henry",

  "My central strength as an actor is the fact that I'm 6 foot 3. A certain power emanates from my size, juxtaposed with the fact that I try to find an element of sensitivity in every character I play.

  "I gathered as much reading material about Aung San Suu Kyi and about Burma as I could. And I read every article and every book she had written. I also had 200 hours of footage of her to watch. I tried to discover who were her heroes and where he desire and strength to pursue democracy in a non-violent fashion came from.": "Michelle",
  "I was struck by Suu Kyi's warmth and generosity. No matter how petite she looks, she exudes amazing strength.

In a weird way, looking at pictures of me when I was 17 or 18, I was dressing the same way. I haven't changed very much.": "Diane",

  "To keep your he-man jaw muscles from smashing your precious teeth, the only set you have, the body evolved an automated braking system faster and more sophisticated than anything on a Lexus.

  "You've got to move us to these technologies that allow us to get to the clean-energy source. If we can't work to reduce the cost, you're not going to see them implemented unless there is a path of unlimited subsidies, and that's not doable, either. We can kick-start the research process, but we have to do that from a position of economic strength.": "Lisa",

  "Strength on its own in a woman is quite abrasive and not terribly attractive all the time.": "Stella",

  "There's no way Daniel Bryan can beat me in a Royal Rumble match. It's ridiculous. He's nowhere near as heavy as me he doesn't have a fraction of the strength I have. There are a lot of ways that Daniel Bryan can possibly beat me. ": "Roman",

  "I have arm-wrestled here and there... guys seem to want to test my strength.": "Shania",

  "Obama won the presidency on the strength of his message and the skills of the messenger. Now the talk of hope and change feels out of tune when so many Americans are out of work, over-mortgaged, and worried that life will be even tougher for their children.": "Ron",
  "Don't kid yourself. President Obama's decision to withdraw 33,000 troops from Afghanistan before he stands for reelection is not driven by the United States' 'position of strength' in the war zone as much as it is by grim economic and political realities at home.": "Ron",
  "All my songs are different, but from the overall experience, I want people to sense that they can overcome and move through difficult times and find strength in my music. Maybe it's a song that makes them cry and move through something else.": "Michael",

  "You can be in love and raise a family wonderfully by not being married, but actually, marriage does give us a strength, because it's quite hard to get out of, and so it makes us fight more to keep it together. If divorce becomes dead easy - which it sort of has - then we don't have that backup. Because, for everybody, relationships are hard.": "Jeremy",

  "In America, now, let us - Christian, Jew, Muslim, agnostic, atheist, wiccan, whatever - fight nativism with the same strength and conviction that we fight terrorism. My faith calls on its followers to love one's enemies. A tall order, that - perhaps the tallest of all.": "Jon",

  "Death has its revelations: the great sorrows which open the heart open the mind as well; light comes to us with our grief. As for me, I have faith; I believe in a future life. How could I do otherwise? My daughter was a soul; I saw this soul. I touched it, so to speak.": "Victor",

  "They say death and taxes are the only things that are inevitable. The truth is, you can not pay your taxes. I've done it, and there's consequences, but it can be done. Death you're not going to get out of, and you kind of got to deal with it.": "Steve",

  "Movies make teenagers have quippy answers for every question. Nothing seems to faze them, and they're like, 'Oh, whatever.' You're not like that when you're a teenager. You're really earnest.

  "A man must be willing to die for justice. Death is an inescapable reality and men die daily, but good deeds live forever.": "Jesse",
  "For centuries the death penalty, often accompanied by barbarous refinements, has been trying to hold crime in check; yet crime persists. Why? Because the instincts that are warring in man are not, as the law claims, constant forces in a state of equilibrium.": "Albert",

  "There should be weeping at a man's birth, not at his death.": "Charles",
  "Marriage is almost as old as dirt, and it was defined in the garden between Adam and Eve. One man, one woman for life till death do you part. So I would never attempt to try to redefine marriage.

The deeper love I have for my siblings and friends. The desire to play the mandolin. The gift of a visitation.": "Mary",
  "Religion provides the only story that is fundamentally consoling in the face of the worst possible experiences - the death of a parent, for instance. In fact, many religions take away the problem entirely, because their adherents ostensibly believe that they're going to be reunited with everyone they love, and death is an illusion.": "Sam",
  "Puerto Ricans who find they can no longer afford to keep their pets often choose to drop their dogs, sometimes even whole litters of puppies, at a beach - sometimes under cover of night, in secret - rather than surrender the animal to a city or state-run shelter where the animals will face grim conditions and almost certain death by euthanasia.": "Juliana",
  "Everything about aging in my experience so far has been a plus. Except the death part!": "Gloria",

  "Johnny Ringo to me was just the best antagonist that I've ever played, because I played him as a guy who has a death wish and had done everything that he wanted in life. As far as he was concerned, a gun fight was about as exciting as it was going to get.": "Michael",
  "There must be a punitive expedition against the Jews in Russia, a punitive expedition which will expect: death sentence and execution. Then the world will see the end of the Jews is also the end of Bolshevism.": "Julius",

  "I have never been what you would call just an integrationist. I know I've been called that... Integrating that bus wouldn't mean more equality.

  "I'm a feminist in the true sense of the word. It's about equality.": "Natalie",
  "Liberals tend to stress how marvelous education is, in and of itself, and also adore it as a vessel for genuine equality. (That's me, by the way: Hell, I think we should be spending $50 billion a year to make college education free).": "Rick",
  "I enjoy repartee and frequently engage in devil's advocacy. In short, when I talk to friends, I do not guard every word that I say because I think that I know they know that my commitment to equality and justice is real, and they would not twist my words or misinterpret what I am saying to them.": "Jeff",
  "The U.N. guards the vital principles entrenched in its charter, notably the sovereign equality of states and the inadmissibility of interference in their internal affairs.

  "Is there an equality of power between America and Iraq? Definitely not; however, the Iraqi people are standing fast and are defending their land courageously.": "Bashar",
  "Martin Luther King was a misguided leader. He worked to be recognized as the leader of black America, when what black America needs isn't a leader - it is education. Giving speeches and marching - that's not the concept that brings about real freedom, equality and justice.": "Don",

  "This is the problem with modern-day feminism. It used to be about equality. Now, it's about bashing men, asking for free stuff, and tearing down other women for refusing to play victim to the trumped-up, B.S. 'War on Women.'": "Tomi",
  "From the naturalistic point of view, all men are equal. There are only two exceptions to this rule of naturalistic equality: geniuses and idiots.": "Mikhail",

  "A fundamentalist can't bring himself or herself to negotiate with people who disagree with them because the negotiating process itself is an indication of implied equality.": "Jimmy",
  "That the caste system must be abolished if the Hindu society is to be reconstructed on the basis of equality, goes without saying. Untouchability has its roots in the caste system.

  "Candor is a compliment it implies equality. It's how true friends talk. ": "Peggy",
  "I think when you're talking about marriage equality and race, people very quickly start to get into their political corners: their ideology comes to the forefront, and they get into this platform argument that they're used to making, which really doesn't have anything to do with the day-to-day basics of what is being talked about.": "Jeff",
  "I think Republicans need to take income inequality more seriously. Not because I favor equality of outcomes. I do not.

  "Private religious speech can't be discriminated against. It has to be treated equally with secular speech.": "Samuel",

  "The focus of tolerance education is to deal with the concept of equality and fairness. We need to establish confidence with children that there is more goodness than horror in this world.": "Morris",
  "You know, my mum's always encouraged me and never made my gender an issue, I guess. She brought me up to believe in equality, as opposed to feminism or sexism - so it just meant that my gender was not relevant to what I was capable of achieving.": "Paloma",

  "Equality and prosperity shouldn't be seen as enemies of each other, but as partners. One reinforces the other.": "Nicola",
  "Our socialism does not include extreme materialistic concepts, since Indonesia is primarily a God-fearing, God-loving nation. Our socialism is a mixture.

  "In articulating all my feelings about marriage equality, I almost don't know where to begin. And perhaps that's part of the problem. Why do we have to explain ourselves when it comes to issues of fairness and equality? Why is common sense not enough?": "Scott",

  "The Millennium Development Goals were a pledge to uphold the principles of human dignity, equality and equity, and free the world from extreme poverty. The MDGs, with eight goals and a set of measurable time-bound targets, established a blueprint for tackling the most pressing development challenges of our time.": "Ban",

  "Citizens of Rome might boast that the claim of 'Civus romanus sum' set them apart from barbarians and slaves, and it was true up to a point, but Roman citizens lived in a society that accepted pain, cruelty, and torture as the norm, and in which there was no suggestion of equality at birth or mercy in the afterlife.": "Michael",

  "Propelled by freedom of faith, gender equality and economic justice for all, India will become a modern nation.

  "Among the best traitors Ireland has ever had, Mother Church ranks at the very top, a massive obstacle in the path to equality and freedom. She has been a force for conservatism... to ward off threats to her own security and influence.": "Bernadette",
  "Mr. Christ, I read you as an infinitely patient entity who, as they say, often works in mysterious ways, a rebel unafraid to take the tougher, less traveled paths. Seems to me you're playing the long game. Is that why more states are coming out in favor of marriage equality? Is that why the Affordable Care Act is now with us?": "Henry",
  "With patient and firm determination, I am going to press on for jobs. I'm going to press on for equality. I'm going to press on for the sake of our children.

  "It's about our ability precisely to integrate a people and offer jobs, and that, for me, is one of the key rationales of the reforms I'm pushing, and I'm a strong believer in that when you lift barriers, when you deregulate a lot of stuff, basically you improve the equality of opportunities.": "Emmanuel",
  "It's a facet of the gay rights movement that people don't think about enough. Why suddenly marriage equality? Because it wasn't until 1981 that the court struck down Louisiana's 'head and master rule,' that the husband was head and master of the house.": "Ruth",

  "You see, Africa makes a fool of our idea of justice. It makes a farce of our idea of equality. It mocks our pieties. It doubts our concern. It questions our commitment. Because there is no way we can look at what's happening in Africa, and if we're honest, conclude that it would ever be allowed to happen anywhere else.": "Bono",
  "Women have full equality with men before the Lord. By nature, the roles of women differ from those of men.

  "Separate inherently is not equal. There's a reason why $45 million was spent against marriage equality. It's because people understand the word does have meaning.

  "Small natures require despotism to exercise their sinews, as great souls thirst for equality to give play to their heart.": "Honore",

  "Why did mainstream America come to accept marriage equality? Gay leaders had made a convincing case that gay families were like straight families and should have the same rights. The American spirit of fair play had been invoked.": "Edmund",
  "Barack Obama's decision to come out in favour of gay marriage may be a historic occasion, but it is not an isolated one.

  "My mum fought for feminism in her day so instilled in me the importance of equality. She taught me so much about women.": "Chris",

  "Within loyalism and the UVF, there are clearly people who are not just aggravated by the issue around flags or parades. They're aggravated by me and Sinn Fein being in government. They're opposed to the political institutions - there's an inability of a minority within loyalism to accept the concept of equality.": "Martin",
  "I know a lot of the work that paved the way for women happened before I was around... I was never that feminist girl demanding equality, but maybe that's because I've never really faced inequality.": "Kaley",

  "I never understood why women wanted equality in the workplace when in fact, that would be selling them short.": "Jay",
  "We should never forget that Americans continue to advocate for individual liberty, equality and self-governance. We often step in when it's necessary to help countries in need. But our history needs no whitewashing. To attempt this does us a terrible disservice.": "Jay",

  "My brother had the courage to come out in 1978, when equality was still a distant dream.": "Elizabeth",
  "Feminism is just an idea. It's a philosophy. It's about the equality of women in all realms. It's not about man-hating. It's not about being humorless. We have to let go of these misconceptions that have plagued feminism for 40, 50 years.": "Roxane",
  "Transgender folks have been part of the push for LGBT equality from the beginning, and we've spoken with loud and intelligent voices and have found political and personal success and advancement all over the world.": "Chelsea",
  "Many queer and trans people live - and lived - in our prison and jails, in our homeless shelters, in run-down houses and apartment buildings, and on the corners of every major city.

  "In my late 20s, I realized that I had a very clear social conscience and strong opinions about things like diversity, equality, and education, and while I tried to become more politically literate, I just couldn't catch on.

  "When you say 'revolution' when you have only men outside, you know that something is going wrong. I'm not like a hardcore feminist, but I think that one of the things that makes the society advanced is equality between men and women.

  "Sometimes black people really want to hold onto our oppression - 'This is ours! This belongs to us.' You can't just talk about equality for somebody else. Let's pass it on. Let's pass it on to somebody else. At the end of the day, it is all about inequality.": "Wanda",

  "When people ask me do I believe in feminism - well, I didn't even know I was a feminist. I was the top of the bill; I've always been the top of the bill. So I don't know what equality is.": "Cilla",
  "I know what it's like to be in the closet! I know what it's like to be bullied and attacked because someone or some group thought I was different or below them... so, I'm coming out of the closet as an ally of equality for everyone; as an ally to hope.": "Jason",
  "I think it is important that you have people from all different vanguards, from all different walks of society and different viewpoints to be focused on the struggle for equality and democracy.

  "Women are the only exploited group in history to have been idealized into powerlessness.": "Erica",

  "The woman who thinks she can choose femininity, can toy with it like the social drinker toys with wine - well, she's asking for it, asking to be undone, devoured, asking to spend her life perpetrating a new fraud, manufacturing a new fake identity, only this time it's her equality that's fake.": "Rachel",
  "Proclaim human equality as loudly as you like, Witless will serve his brother.": "Thomas",
  "Single women will get us closer to gender equality, and that will take many forms, including a reimagining of what families entail and what it means to have a full female life. Also, their presence will force the government to support a population of independent women more capably.": "Rebecca",
  "Equality is not in regarding different things similarly, equality is in regarding different things differently.": "Tom",
  "I don't consider myself a feminist, but I feel very empowered as a woman, and I've used all my resources widely. I believe in equality, but that's just naturally happening.

  "Take your message of equality of achievement, take your message of economic dependency, take your message of enslaving the entrepreneurial will and spirit of the American people somewhere else.": "Allen",

  "The king knows with what ardor and perseverance I have at all times been devoted to the cause of liberty and to the principles of humanity, equality and justice.": "Marquis",
  "Feminism is nothing but equality, and actually, feminism benefits men because it liberates us and it releases us from many stigmas imposed by the macho culture on us as well. So if more of us could understand that it's nothing but equality, I think many agendas in terms of equality would have advanced quicker because it really helps us as well.": "Edgar",
  "I just believe in equality for all.": "Ashley",
  "The government should help and guide the weak and small racial groups within its national boundaries toward self-determination and self-government.

  "Am I feminist? I don't know. I'm not really sure what that is. I am all up for equality to a certain extent, although in the home, I do feel this is where the mother excels and the man needs to step back a bit. My family is from Nigeria, and this is our culture.": "Anthony",
  "Vivek is a very supportive man. If I am in the kitchen doing something, he comes and helps. I don't think marriage will change anything for us. Our careers will not be affected after marriage. He believes in gender equality and is a man of today's time.": "Divyanka",

There's certainly a place for them, but you don't promote the Spice Girls at the expense of promoting what I think are good role models for girls. You need to create some kind of equality.": "Greg",
  "Just as modern mass production requires the standardization of commodities, so the social process requires standardization of man, and this standardization is called equality.": "Erich",
  "The Islamic tradition does show some areas of apparent incompatibility with the goals of women in the West, and Muslims have a long way to go in their attitudes towards women.

  "It's tougher for women than men in Hollywood, period, if you ask me. As with most professions, women have generally not found equality with men when it comes to income and influence.

  "The thing I want to see before I die is women achieving full equality in the world. I'm very passionate about injustice against women and there's too much of it in the world. In so many parts of the world, women are not regarded as worthy or equal to men. In parts of the world, women are bought and sold.": "Cherie",

  "My teenage years were exactly what they were supposed to be. Everybody has their own path. It's laid out for you. It's just up to you to walk it.": "Justin",
  "Adolescence isn't just about prom or wearing sparkly dresses.": "Jena",
  "I'm a teenager, but I'm independent - I have my own apartment, I have my own life. And I think I have learned more than any of those teenagers have in school. I learned to be responsible, leaving my family and coming here alone.": "Adriana",
  "Most people, almost everyone knows of a teen mom. Teen pregnancy rates are growing, and we need to bring awareness to that.": "Madisen",
  "You have teenagers thinking they're going to make millions as NBA stars when that's not realistic for even 1 percent of them. Becoming a scientist or engineer is.": "Dean",
  "I liked being a teenager, but I would not go back for all the tea in China.": "Rob",
  "Trouble is, kids feel they have to shock their elders and each generation grows up into something harder to shock.": "Ben",
  "There is a point in every young person's life when you realize that the youth that you've progressed through and graduate to some sort of adulthood is equally as messed up as where you're going.": "Jena",
  "This generation has given up on growth. They're just hoping for survival.": "Penelope",
  "Teenagers who are never required to vacuum are living in one.": "Fred",
  "Children, even infants, are capable of sympathy. But only after adolescence are we capable of compassion.": "Louise",
  "As a teen, I was both anorexic and bulimic.": "Alanis",
  "In my early teen years, I wanted to become a vet. That was my plan. I worked as a veterinarian's assistant for a couple of summers.": "Dennis",
  "I didn't date for my entire teen life - it just wasn't on my mind.": "Kiesza",
  "I'm really good at making teen angst romantic. I'm really good at dealing with heartbreak and things like that and making it into this whole experience. But there's no way to make someone-on-the-Internet-said-something-mean-about-me into romantic angst where you can listen to music and cry or whatever.": "Tavi",
  "It's important to me that I don't get trapped in the whole teen scene, because I feel that you can get lost in those kind of movies, and they aren't really about the actors; they're about the selling of the concept, and how much money it makes.": "Kirsten",
  "I think I'm trouble-adjacent. I remember hearing once that good girls don't get caught. I think that's sort of a lot of what my teen years were like. I skirted the stuff that other kids were doing because the idea of actually getting in trouble was not appealing to me, but I still wanted to have adventures.": "Anna",
  "Sometimes people come up to me and say, 'You were my teen crush.' I'm honored and I'm touched, but I also ask, 'What happened? Why'd you take the poster down?' I get a little heartbroken in that situation.": "Christian",
  "After 'Freaky Friday,' another teen movie was not on my playlist.": "Mark",
  "I think if you ask people why they watch me, there would be some common thread among all of them that I'm somewhat of an awkward older sister. I have a teen, mostly female demographic. How that happened, I don't know. But I think they see me as some sort of bizarre role model, and I'll keep trying to do that for them.": "Grace",
  "My interest was magic, believe it or not. I became an amateur magician and did something like 400 magic shows through my teen years.": "David",
  "I grew up watching a lot of stuff, like 'Teen Titans.'": "Jeremy",
  "I grew up in a difficult environment, but I became a Christian as a teen. My mom and my sister soon became Christians also.": "Melody",
  "Teen pregnancy went way down in the '90s, and 75 percent of it was because of increased use of contraception.": "Al",
  "I was a happy kid up until I hit the teen years.": "Rick",
  "I love my mom so much, and I always have, but I was definitely a monster to her a lot during my teen years.": "Dove",
  "People ask me, 'How's 'Teen Wolf?' and I tell them it's literally the best job I've ever had. It's hard. Everybody wants to be a series regular. It's something that a lot of actors would kill to have. That being said, it's very demanding of you, in so many different ways.": "Shelley",
  "Growing up, I wanted desperately to please, to be a good girl.": "Claire",
  "I was a teen idol and that has a short shelf life.": "Shaun",
  "To an adolescent, there is nothing in the world more embarrassing than a parent.": "Dave",
  "If you just watch a teenager, you see a lot of uncertainty.": "Jamie",
  "Time scoots along pretty fast when you grow up.": "Alan",
  "In the public, it seems to be painted that when minorities get pregnant, they need to get abortions, especially when it comes to teen pregnancy. It's like, when black girls are pregnant, it's like a statistic, but when white girls get pregnant, they get a TV show.": "Benjamin",
  "My whole life, growing up, I always wanted to be in comedy. I never felt comfortable doing the 'teen hunk' thing.": "Dustin",
  "The endless teen franchises that come out of Hollywood... more often than not, the central character doesn't have any discernible character traits. They're just the young, good-looking guy who goes on this journey. They're always played by fantastic young actors, but ultimately, they're not very interesting characters.": "Taron",
  "Your modern teenager is not about to listen to advice from an old person, defined as a person who remembers when there was no Velcro.": "Dave",
  "To all those mothers and fathers who are struggling with teen-agers, I say, just be patient: even though it looks like you can't do anything right for a number of years, parents become popular again when kids reach 20.": "Marian",
  "When I look in the mirror I see the girl I was when I was growing up, with braces, crooked teeth, a baby face and a skinny body.": "Heather",
  "No matter how good you are, at some point your kids are gonna have to create their own independence and think that Mom and Dad aren't cool, just to establish themselves. That's what adolescence is about. They're gonna go through that no matter what.": "Eddie",
  "Female adolescence is - universally - an emotionally and psychologically intense period.": "Caitlin",
  "I love the live performances and Las Vegas. I also like making films that are being discovered by another generation. Having been a teen idol of the '60s is great because you realize you left your generation with a smile and good memories.": "Connie",
  "We won a contest at the teen fair in Vancouver and the first prize was a recording contract and we recorded at a radio station on the stairway, and we did a record and it got put out.": "Tommy",
  "Teen pop will never die as long as there are teens and popular music. It just takes a different head.": "Justin",
  "When I was a teenager I would lock myself in the bathroom for hours, bouffanting my hair like Patty Duke and trying to recreate Barbra Streisand's flawless eyeliner, only to comb it all out and wash it all off before stepping out into the world a butchish bisexual teen.": "Beth",
  "I like having young assistants in my office; they have energy, and I spend time with them to make sure they understand what we're doing. By investing in them, I'm investing in the magazine. All over 'Vogue,' 'Teen Vogue,' and 'Men's Vogue,' there are people who have been through not only my office but also many other offices at 'Vogue.'": "Anna",
  "During my teen years, I was real emotional. I could be really up or down.": "Andie",
  "I won Miss Teen World, and then a movie rep saw me on the pageant website and thought that I had the perfect image for the role in 'Madrasapattinam.'": "Amy",
  "That can be the most painstaking aspect of being a teen, figuring out what the world really looks like. If you find someone in a book, you know you're not alone and that's what's so comforting about books.": "Laurie",
  "As a teen, I heard the second Velvet Underground album, 'White Light/White Heat,' and it was too much for my limited scope of appreciation. It was intense, but I didn't get it.": "Henry",
  "I'm a comic nerd. I'm a former serious collector for much of my childhood and early teen years I wanted to draw underground comics.": "Anthony",
  "Can you imagine peaking as a teen? I think if you peak in high school, there's a problem. That's what my sister always said: 'Don't worry, you'll peak later.'": "Chelsea",
  "I was one of those daughters who saw my mother as my enemy when I was a teen.": "Deborah",
  "At the time I came along, Hollywood's idea of teen movies meant there had to be a lot of nudity, usually involving boys in pursuit of sex, and pretty gross overall. Either that or a horror movie. And the last thing Hollywood wanted in their teen movies was teenagers!": "John",
  "Honestly, I never thought I'd actually be playing a teen lesbian. I didn't think it was going to go this far. But I'm glad that it did, because there have been a lot of fans who have expressed that they've been going through similar situations in their lives.": "Naya",
  "Even when I was a teen model, I didn't think it was fair that I had to enter the acting world to get insurance.": "Tyra",
  "I would not recommend a teen getting into modeling if they're not solid when it comes to their grades and school. That comes first. My mother always told me that came first.": "Tyra",
  "I've started ordering out of teen catalogues! T-shirts, little coats, and jackets for around $35 - they're amazing. I've become a really big fan of Urban Outfitters, Alloy and Anthropologie. Because I'll pay for quality, but I will not just pay for trend. Psychologically, I have trouble with that.": "Ivanka",
  "I remember the first time I saw the 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' video. I will never forget that day. I just wanted to see Kurt Cobain's face. I had a feeling he was very cute. But, I couldn't see his face. When I finally did see him, he was even cuter than I imagined!": "Shakira",
  "Prosecutors say it would be next to impossible to get one teen to testify in court that another had slipped him or her a copied disc at lunchtime. And besides, isn't sharing music a time-honored part of teen friendship?": "Charles",
  "Growing up, I had an internal struggle with my body because I was really chubby. My sisters were younger, and they were all skinny and all cute. As a teen, I definitely had, like, an extra 30 pounds of weight.": "Christina",
  "People now tell me it's a good thing I stayed away from teen films. Well, it wasn't my choice. I wasn't hired.": "Laura",
  "If a movie isn't a hit right out of the gate, they drop it. Which means that the whole mainstream Hollywood product has been skewed toward violence and vulgar teen comedy.": "Roger",
  "I think anybody who's doing work in their teen years on TV or in the movies, you're a teen idol by default.": "Jason",
  "People still come up to me and say, 'Hey, 'Teen Wolf!' 'Teen Wolf Too' closed a week after it opened. Where did they see it?": "Jason",
  "In my teen years, I was hanging out with adults - Steven Meisel, Francois Nars, Oribe, Paul Cavaco. We had so much fun! We'd go out in New York.": "Christy",
  "There's always a Justin Bieber. Ever since I've been around, there's always been one of him. You know, you can trace it back from how old you are and the boy bands that came along then and the teen sensations and whatnot. And, you know, good for them. There's a few of them that make it out and a few of them that don't.": "Kid",
  "Once a teen has been identified as part of the 'target market,' he knows he's done for. The object of the game is to confound the marketers, and keep one's own, authentic culture from showing up at the shopping mall as a prepackaged corporate product.": "Douglas",
  "Let us develop an agenda for children that says we can do something about teen pregnancy. Let us make sure that parents are old enough, wise enough, and financially able to take care of their children.": "Janet",
  "Ric Flair was such a huge part of my childhood and teen years. He's an icon.": "Darius",
  "My kids idea of a hard life is to live in a house with only one phone.": "George",
  "I so think it's limiting to define an audience ahead of time. This is something I've brought on myself by being like, 'There are no 'real' teen publications! That's what I'll do!' But then it's like, well, if I want 'Rookie' to be successful and popular, then people will invalidate the realness by saying it's popular and mainstream.": "Tavi",
  "'Rookie' is not your guide to Being a Teen. It is, quite simply, a bunch of writing and art we like and believe in.": "Tavi",
  "I instinctively dress a bit tougher because I've spent a lot of time in the U.S. and I realised there was a certain image projected of me here. I've always been an absolute rebel. When I was in my teen years I had piercings and wore all black.": "Ellie",
  "I was a handful growing up.": "Olivia",
  "There was a three-year chunk as a teen where I should have been tranquilized and put in a cage.": "Melissa",
  "I built my entire career off of teen comedies. I was in 'Bring It On'.": "Kirsten",
  "Guilty pleasure implies that it's something that I feel guilty for watching... people tell me I should feel guilty for watching because I'm too old to watch it, but I don't give a damn: I love everything on Cartoon Network from 'Adventure Time' to 'The Adventures of Gumball', 'Teen Titans'... all those shows that are for my kids, I like those!": "Ne-Yo",
  "Doesn't matter whether it's a teen girl who's pregnant, hasn't told her parents, or an elderly couple dealing with one of them being diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Those are real people to me. Those are the people I dealt with every single day.": "Mike",
  "For the youth, the indignation of most things will just surge as each birthday passes.": "Chris",
  "When I found out I had to take off my shirt in 'Teen' movie, I panicked and hit the gym. I was like, 'It's going to be on film, documented, for my children to see. I can't be 140 pounds. I need to put on a little bit of muscle.'": "Chris",
  "Costumes say a lot about a character. When it came to 'Palo Alto,' it was important for me that the kids didn't look perfect. In most teen movies today, all of the clothes are expensive. I remember wearing a lot of dirty vintage clothes.": "Gia",
  "Mrs. Palin is history in a dress. And her script is straight out of Hollywood - like those teen movies with the cliched ending featuring the female valedictorian delivering the speech of a lifetime projecting a bold and transformative future with an independent-minded woman in charge.": "Andrew",
  "Lesley Gore's part-time field was pop singer, and in her brief but urgent prime, she was the Queen of Teen Angst. She endured heartbreak as a birthday girl betrayed by her beau in 'It's My Party,' savored revenge in the sequel 'Judy's Turn to Cry' and belted the proto-feminist anthem 'You Don't Own Me.'": "Richard",
  "Fifth grade was when I first heard 'Smells Like Teen Spirit;' it was the energy, and his voice. I liked 311 and Sublime, too, though that might have been a little after that.": "Ty",
  "I was a teen star. That's disgusting enough.": "John",
  "As a precocious teen I dreamed of being Graham Greene. Well, as it turned out, I never wrote a great novel, sadly, and I never converted to Catholicism, happily, but I did do one thing he did. That is, in middle age I moved to a seaside town and got into a right barney with the local powers-that-be.": "Julie",
  "All that stuff - 'teen idol' - that wasn't me.": "David",
  "Just do me a favor. Don't call me 'former teen heartthrob,' okay? It's as if they were constantly discussing your second year of college. I'm not back there anymore. I'm living in the present.": "David",
  "I love being in a public space where teenagers are talking. And the funny thing is that it hasn't changed that much. There's certainly slang that I'm not familiar with, but among the average teen, it's still the same.": "Marti",
  "I definitely think there could be stricter teen driving laws.": "Victoria",
  "To even be called the 'teen queen' is crazy.": "Victoria",
  "I really liked 'Starter For Ten' because I grew up watching 1980s teen films like 'St. Elmo's Fire' and 'The Breakfast Club' and I've always wanted to play the underdog lead hero in a 1980s-inspired film.": "James",
  "I never listened to the Grateful Dead as a teen the only exposure I got was what came through the walls when my sister was listening to them. ": "J.",
  "I'd never made a teen comedy in my life.": "Harvey",
  "Children born to teens have less supportive and stimulating environments, poorer health, lower cognitive development, and worse educational outcomes. Children of teen mothers are at increased risk of being in foster care and becoming teen parents themselves, thereby repeating the cycle.": "Jane",
  "If we as a nation are to break the cycle of poverty, crime and the growing underclass of young people ill equipped to be productive citizens, we need to not only implement effective programs to prevent teen pregnancy, but we must also help those who have already given birth so that they become effective, nurturing, bonding parents.": "Jane",
  "Clothes are like a suit of armour when you're young. I was quite a shy teen, so I wanted to make aggressive statements with the way I looked. I'd say my goth/indie stage was the worst: there was a lot of experimentation involving pink food dye in my fringe.": "Erin",
  "I want to help middle-school girls stay interested in math and be good at it, and see it as friendly and accessible and not this scary thing. Everyone else in society tells them it's not for them. It's for nerdy white guys with pocket protectors.": "Danica",
  "I hate it when people call me a teen queen.": "Lindsay",
  "I've always enjoyed teen characters, and kids as well. For whatever reason, I seem to have an ability to do it sort of well, and I enjoy doing it.": "Jeff",
  "I was a total metal-head as a teen. I still love it, too.": "Kristian",
  "When I was in the 12th grade, I got my girlfriend pregnant. I just got out of school, she was a 10th-grader. I'm a teen parent, and I'm at a point where I'm like, 'Man I've got to do something.'": "Ice",
  "When I started out as a music journalist, at the end of the 1980s, it was generally assumed that we were living through the lamest music era the world would ever see. But those were also the years when hip-hop exploded, beatbox disco soared, indie rock took off, and new wave invented a language of teen angst.": "Rob",
  "The area of teenage life is not necessarily rarefied; we've all gone through that period. It's not as rarefied as a western or a space adventure or a gangster film, but it has its own dynamic.": "Gus",
  "I see it as more of a teenage activity than, you know, she's only 11, but you know, I think it's great that she knows so many girls who want to play music. And I see it more as a teen activity than I do as going into music.": "Kim",
  "Typically, middle-class educated parents' search for their children's schools takes on the feel, if not of teen girls trying on different outfits, of adolescents trying on various selves.": "Sandra",
  "I've always gravitated towards those ultimate lines in songs, the line you grab on to. That line in 'Smells Like Teen Spirit,' 'Here we are now/Entertain us' - the irony, the antagonism; that's always stuck with me.": "Corey",
  "The United States has made remarkable progress in reducing both teen pregnancy and racial and ethnic differences, but the reality is, too many American teens are still having babies.": "Tom",
  "They were marketing me as a teen idol, when the stuff on the record was not what teen idols were doing at the time.": "Rick",
  "I mean, I'm pretty good in real life, but sometimes people seem surprised that I'm like a normal teenager and wear black nail polish and I'm just a little bit more edgy than the person I play on television.": "Brittany",
  "People love teen movies because everyone can relate.": "Zoe",
  "People don't know the real me. The hard times I went through are what led me to my life now. I was a mess as a teen! I was kind of wild and really unhappy.": "Kristin",
  "I just fell into the job as a fashion editor at a teen magazine. I was there for two years, and I left there as a senior fashion editor at the age of 25.": "Rachel",
  "Obviously when you're a teen you have no money, so you make, like, three outfits out of one dress. You're like, 'OK cut the arms here. Alright: New party, cut them to here.'": "Marina",
  "I grew up in Detroit. I was a teen father. I lived on welfare for three years. I have a brother serving life in prison, though I believe he's innocent.": "Michael",
  "Well, I could do it for a day, but I wouldn't want to be a teenager again. I really wouldn't.": "Jamie",
  "I didn't want to be the typical teen idol. I didn't want to be Leif Garrett. I didn't want to be Shaun Cassidy, David Cassidy or Parker Stevenson. I wanted to do my own thing.": "Willie",
  "Being a teen idol or being a heartthrob on all the magazines, with Shaun Cassidy, Leif Garrett, and Scott Baio - it was embarrassing! I never understood it. I mean, why me? I never really got it.": "Willie",
  "I found my niche as a character actor, and I've never felt like a movie star or teen idol and never wanted to.": "Vincent",
  "When I was a teenager, I read a lot of Poe.": "Dario",
  "I will say that I know Nirvana did a show and played a few chords from 'More Than a Feeling' before they did 'Teen Spirit,' and it wasn't very good. But in all seriousness, 'Teen Spirit' was a great song. If subconsciously or somehow I had any influence on that, I'll take that as a compliment.": "Tom",
  "Most of the offers I get from Hollywood are for teen comedies. My manager thinks I'm crazy for turning down all that money, but I'm very picky.": "Macaulay",
  "I was into all kinds of music as a teen - country music, because my dad was in a band that played country, and whatever my sister and brother were into.": "Martina",
  "If you were an optimistic teen, then you'll be an optimist at 80. People's reactions to bad events are highly stable over a half century or more.": "Martin",
  "I don't think there's a problem with being a teen idol, if that happens to me, I'll be happy to deal with it.": "Josh",
  "I wasn't going to have fun doing a teen movie again.": "Heath",
  "As a kid, I was definitely a DC guy. I started reading big time in the '80s at the height of the Wolfman/Perez 'New Teen Titans.' That was definitely the book that hooked me.": "Jason",
  "I went on an audition once for a show, and the feedback was to play an angry teen. My agent convinced me to try out. I was really bitter for a while, because it sucks when you don't get good scripts after working on good quality.": "Alia",
  "Heredity is what sets the parents of a teenager wondering about each other.": "Laurence",
  "Watching 'CSI: Miami' is like watching 'Teen Jeopardy!' or doing the crossword puzzle in 'People' magazine. It makes you feel smart even when you're not.": "Willie",
  "Teen authors love to flirt with taboo, to grapple - sensitively - with dark and frightening issues, and there is nothing darker and more frightening than cancer.": "Mal",
  "The phrase 'teen hottie' literally makes me want to throw up.": "Lorde",
  "I think I am too old to be doing teen movies. I am just kind of annoyed, because you have all these teen movies coming out with usually either Lindsay Lohan or Hilary Duff doing four of the exact teen movies over and over again.": "Alexa",
  "I wanted to be a writer as a teen... so storytelling was my first love. In my late teens, design became an obsession as I realized that I could express myself through the medium. Much later, when I founded Fuseproject in 1999, our slogan became 'design brings stories to life.'": "Yves",
  "How the original 'Cosmos' affected me personally was long-term. I wasn't born early enough to see the original series, but after getting a hold of it in my teen years, it was one of the driving forces behind my passion for science.": "Kyle",
  "In my teen years leading up to the Olympics, I loved having the excuse to skip out on parties because of skating. Partying wasn't my thing anyway. Mostly I hung out with other skaters. We were all buddies, so it's not like I missed out on socializing. I was really enjoying myself.": "Dorothy",
  "Before my teen years, I was losing my hearing pretty quickly, and I was getting very, very angry. I was beginning to become an angry person because of that.": "Evelyn",
  "I think there's a time in your life where you don't feel like you fit in. I think everyone has that when you're a teenager, especially, and especially in the society we live in.": "Matthew",
  "I didn't have a teen age at all. I didn't even look at boys, never mind... then suddenly it was like, 'Oh my god!' So I made up for a lot of lost time very quickly. It was kind of bonkers. Working hard, partying hard - but also experiencing life, you know.": "Anne-Marie",
  "I started wearing all black around the time I got into Nirvana. I first heard 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' when I was about 12, and I remember jumping on my bed, so excited about it.": "Natasha",
  "Being a musician since I was a teen, Guitar Center is the staple. You need anything to create, it's there. You need a Guitar Center. You gotta give it homage. It's a tool shed, and without the tool shed, it's hard to create.": "Steve",
  "I will be able to look back on my teen years as spent on a television set just having the biggest bunch of fun.": "Sophie",
  "I had teen angst for a while, but I think every teenager has the angst.": "Jamie",
  "I tend to like writing long stories in comics. I worked on 'Flash,' 'Teen Titans' and 'JSA' for years. I always like diving into characters.": "Geoff",
  "My first job in TV was hosting this young teen magazine show, and all these high school teenagers showed up from all over Sacramento, California, and they chose four of us to host the show, two boys and two girls. And of the two girls, I was kind of the perky smart one and the other girl was the pretty one.": "Lisa",
  "Everybody is a teenage idol.": "Barry",
  "I played teen roles until high definition came out, and I could never understand it. I would go in for adult roles and be older than many of the people auditioning, but they'd cast the girl without a line on her face.": "Selma",
  "I actually love writing for teens best. I had such an awful time in my own teen years - I love having the chance to relive them through my fiction.": "Meg",
  "The donning of the ear buds marks the beginning of teen life, when children set off on their own for the passage through adolescence.": "Amity",
  "I grew up in a house where nobody had to tell me to go to school every day and do my homework.": "Constance",
  "I had no idea of the size of my bank account as a teen, and I didn't care to know. That was my mom's job, I figured that I would just find out when I turned 18. If you can't trust your mom, then who can you trust?": "Anna",
  "It seems like whenever a big newspaper or TV show talks about teen literature, they focus on dark books or vampire books. It's kind of this cliche. It seems like the only time adults pay attention is with that angle.": "Jay",
  "Teenagers are asking, 'Who am I?' and 'How do I fit in?' in every aspect of their lives, and the best YA romances appreciate that there is more to a teen's life than finding love.": "Sarah",
  "'Teen Moms!' I started watching them like the first two seasons, and I stopped. I stopped because they are too young. I feel sorry for them. And I didn't watch that show 'Hoarders.' That thing would made my skin crawl.": "NeNe",
  "I first read Harper Lee's 'To Kill a Mockingbird' as a teen in school, like you did. I read the book alone, eating lunch at my locker, neatly scored oranges my mother divided into five lines with a circle at the top, so my fingers could dig more easily into the orange skin. To this day, the smell of oranges reminds me of 'Mockingbird.'": "Margaret",
  "The eight months I took off between 'Teen Vogue' and 'Lucky' afforded me such amazing opportunities, and I learned so much from so many different people - the brands that I worked with, the companies that I was consulting for.": "Eva",
  "I wanted to be with the kind of people I'd grown up with, but you can't go back to them and be one of them again, no matter how hard you try.": "Ethel",
  "I think the feeling was that 'Venture Brothers' really has something to sell in terms of a feature. 'Aqua Teen' is an element minute cartoon, and its very subversive and non sequitur and weird. We were writing the one show where we were constantly like, 'God, I wish we had another hour to tell this story.' It seemed like a natural fit.": "Christopher",
  "Katy Perry still gets me every time. She's very funny in person! We met at the Teen Choice Awards and she pulled my cheeks apart and told me how cute I was. My life was literally flashing before my eyes!": "Niall",
  "'Teen Spirit' is a celebration of the power that music can deliver to the cinematic experience.": "Max",
  "What's great about teen fiction is that it's all mixed up - there's highbrow and lowbrow!": "Kaui",
  "As I got older, I had a bunch of friends that were various teen stars. I've always known people in the spotlight and people who just grew up in L.A. and had nothing to do with the industry. It's not a glamorous thing to me. It's just a different type of business.": "Troian",
  "I'm not a teen anymore, but growing up, some of my favorite things were, like, 'Twin Peaks,' which wasn't even really my time, and this is one of the things, like a weird, quirky, small town mystery.": "Troian",
  "I spent the first fourteen years of my life convinced that my looks were hideous. Adolescence is painful for everyone, I know, but mine was plain weird.": "Uma",
  "I saw myself as an outsider as a teen. I was home-schooled and got my G.E.D. when I was 16 I wasn't interested in high school at all and figured that college might be more entertaining. ": "Maggie",
  "When I was a teen, I thought I would have to choose between my writing or my music or my art, but it turns out it's a difficult juggling game but I can do all of them.": "Maggie",
  "I wouldn't say I'm stuck in my adolescence, but I think, like a lot of people, I carry my teen years with me. I feel really in touch with those feelings, and how intense and complicated life seems in those years.": "Sara",
  "I think there are worse things for a teen to be enraptured with than 'Twilight.'": "Stephen",
  "I just felt being part of my peer group so strongly. I was immersed in teen culture, but not taken in by it.": "S.",
  "I don't know if this is too weird to say, but this is completely surreal for me. Bizarre. The cover of 'Teen Vogue' has been on my bucket list forever.": "Lily",
  "I think growing up is difficult and it's a process that I'm always interested in, with kids and adults, they are often on two different universes.": "Alice",
  "Time misspent in youth is sometimes all the freedom one ever has.": "Anita",
  "Growing up, I've enjoyed hunting with my father.": "Dale",
  "I was a quiet teenager, introverted, full of angst.": "Nigella",
  "Since my teen years I was interested in martial arts.": "Tony",
  "The most important role models should and could be parents and teachers. But that said, once you're a teenager you've probably gotten as much of an example from your parents as you're going to.": "Andrew",
  "If you can get a teen leader in each sector of a student population, you can pull people in. Everybody wants to get involved, but most are too afraid. When they see a person they think is cool leading it, they're first to join.": "Andrew",
  "I got the acting bug really young, when I was around, like, 10. I pretty much just wanted to be Michael J. Fox. He was in 'Teen Wolf' - that was, like, the coolest role, and then he did 'Back to the Future,' and that was the coolest role.": "Bryan",
  "I was, like, this token teen angst child of Broadway. It's so funny. What is that? I don't even know. But I loved it.": "Jennifer",
  "One of my first paid gigs was writing psychology quizzes for 'YM,' a monthly teen magazine like 'Seventeen.'": "K.",
  "When I was a teen, I was never really into the captain of the football team or the student body president. The guys I liked were quirky and different: They listened to music I'd never heard of, never had lunch or gas money, and could always make you laugh.": "Sarah",
  "I love writing about the summer between high school and college. It's the last gasp of really being a teen.": "Sarah",
  "When I started writing, there was nothing about zombies. It was all teen movies, which to me are scarier than zombies, but that's another story.": "Max",
  "A surprising number of American skyjackers were not yet old enough to drink or sometimes even drive. These adolescents were generally inept at planning their crimes, and few of their capers met with any success; most seemed to end within moments of starting, usually after a fatherly pilot convinced the nervous teen to hand over his gun.": "Brendan",
  "I'm definitely of the 'Harry Potter'-transfigured-me-into-a-reader-and-writer generation. And that's really all I read throughout my teen years, because I really devoted all my time to writing and reading friends' fan-fiction.": "Adam",
  "I don't like being compared to anyone or being in a class with someone. I'm a teen actress and therefore I'm competing against Hilary Duff. We're different people like everyone else.": "Amanda",
  "The Teen Challenge ministry was born out of those humble early days of ministry. It now includes over 500 drug and alcohol rehab centers around the world, even in Muslim countries. These include homes for girls and women addicts and alcoholics, all which are reaching many.": "David",
  "The Teen Challenge Training Center on Pennsylvania farmland houses over 200 men in rehab. Other farms and centers have been birthed out of this ministry all over the world.": "David",
  "I am not officially involved now in the direction of the Teen Challenge ministry, but I rejoice that God permits me to be the father of these ministries.": "David",
  "Every Teen Challenge ministry is responsible for raising its own finances, but we assist these works with finances, prayer and counseling, especially overseas in areas such as Siberia, Africa, South America.": "David",
  "If you were an alien who came to our bookstores - or browsed our teen magazines - you'd think that only Earth girls who look like Mila Kunis ever got any action.": "Rainbow",
  "The eighties were my teen years, so the GoGos are sort of a touchstone.": "Corin",
  "My first break was becoming a staff writer on the rebooted '90210.' And then I got stuck writing in the teen genre for a while.": "Allison",
  "This may just be me, but I feel like everyone's dream is to live as an American high school student. There are so many teen films set in America that you live vicariously through them, anyway.": "Katherine",
  "At the age of 16 I was already dreaming of having a baby because I felt myself to be an adult, but my mum forbid it. Right now, I feel like a teenager and I want to have fun for one or two more years before starting a family.": "Milla",
  "Growing up, I didn't have a lot of toys, and personal entertainment depended on individual ingenuity and imagination - think up a story and go live it for an afternoon.": "Terry",
  "Can you imagine young people nowadays making a study of trigonometry for the fun of it? Well I did.": "Clyde",
  "I got through my teen years by being a bit of a clown.": "Diane",
  "I was never interested in 'Teen Beat' like roles. I just wanted to work.": "Jared",
  "Certain elements of teen life that, 10 years ago, were very important to me still, are becoming less so as I get older. I mean, I've kinda gotten over, I guess I'm saying, the fact that I had trouble getting a date for the prom.": "Matthew",
  "I think I'm also more open to other writers being present and listening to other opinions, whereas before I was going through my angsty teen years while making records.": "Michelle",
  "Teen movies often have an unspoken underlying premise in which high school is seen as less serious than the adult world. But when your head is encased in that microcosm it's the most serious time of your life.": "Rian",
  "I was a typical Valley teen, in smoggy Van Nuys.": "Ed",
  "I was a typical teen growing up in the 1960s, when everybody was into gurus and meditation.": "David",
  "If you try to bring 'teen drama,' you end up doing nothing but pouting.": "Max",
  "We all have an interest in making sure teens grow up healthy and drug-free.": "John",
  "Teen drug use went up dramatically in the 1990s.": "John",
  "Research shows that parents are the single biggest influence on children - if you are worried about your teen and drugs, talk to them.": "John",
  "I have been in teen shows for years, so doing that stuff - kissing - is kind of commonplace and not a big deal. It was way more cool just because it was Meg Ryan.": "Adam",
  "I decided that, if I were to write a teen series, I'd want to set it in a place that was familiar to me - Manhattan, where I'd grown up - and I'd model the characters on myself and my friends.": "Cecily",
  "Teen problem novels? I can go through them like a box of chocolates. And there are fantasy books out now that need a lot more editing. Fantasy got to be so popular that people began to think 'We don't need to be as diligent with the razor blade,' but they do.": "Tamora",
  "Final Destination was the closest thing I've done to a teen movie but it certainly had an edge to it.": "Devon",
  "If I can write a book that will help the world make a little more sense to a teen, then that's why I was put on the planet.": "Laurie",
  "Yeah, I spent my teen years in West Virginia, and when I was a kid, in Louisiana. I definitely have that exposure to two different sorts of rural: the South and Appalachia.": "Sam",
  "Well, I actually first got into music as a small child, and as I became a teen, I sought out making money from music, weather that was singing lounge gigs, backup in studios, or weddings.": "Chantal",
  "I can have a song with Ariana Grande that is going to be the song for all the kids and the teen girls, and then another song that could be for a different group of people who all love the song. I'm with whoever. Whatever type of people want to love the music and whatever they love about the music is fine with me.": "Mac",
  "I did try to get a few of those teen high-school movies, but they just didn't like me. I guess I wasn't a certain type.": "Leelee",
  "Frank Sinatra is the only one that went from teen idol to superstar.": "Leif",
  "I took high school very casually. There was Teen Town, chess, tennis, boxing, running. Lots of things going on.": "Robert",
  "I remember as a teen being able to eat more than my father. I was growing so fast and my body couldn't keep up.": "Saskia",
  "I'd like a pop-up magazine with 45 articles on Russell Crowe. I'm like a teenager. I'd have 'Teen Beat' if I could, for grown-ups.": "Caroline",
  "'Snowpiercer' is a little bit more experimental, I think, and crafted for a slightly different audience. 'The Giver' is more about teen angst.": "Marco",
  "The average teen today spends about 35 hours a week in front of a screen of some kind: iPod, movie, TV, video. And a lot of it is good, but a lot of it's not. And so I think you've got that five hours a day of media coming into your kid's head that's creating a lot of havoc out there.": "Sean",
  "To be honest, I haven't seen a lot of the current crop of teen movies because there's only so much time and there's nothing that really drives me to do it.": "Curtis",
  "Ever since I was a little teen, I was told by my great-grandma that you've got to always have a good moisturizer. I use cocoa butter, and I use it for all things needing moisture - face, hair, throw it on those legs at the beach, get them all shiny. Cocoa butter is such a great product.": "Sufe",
  "I consider myself a writer. I always wanted to act, and as a teen, I studied acting devotedly. Eventually, I got writing work, but very little acting work.": "Winnie",
  "A fairly bright boy is far more intelligent and far better company than the average adult.": "John",
  "Writing a teen character is something I wanted to try again for a long time!": "Emily",
  "Yes, but I don't think of the Teen Angel as of an age.": "Frankie",
  "I don't want to just be in the normal kind of teen movie.": "Stephen",
  "Robin McKinley's 'The Blue Sword' was a defining book of my teen years, and I'd love to have more books like that in the world.": "Carrie",
  "I don't usually like teen novels written in the present tense, particularly those told from a first-person viewpoint. Too many writers seem to believe that using either or both devices automatically imbues their stories with deep seriousness and a contemporary feel.": "Tony",
  "I'm so fascinated by the concept of teen pregnancy for some reason. Not that I condone it or promote it, but it's just a very real thing in our country and culture.": "Leven",
  "Material Girls was so different for me, I'd never done a teen movie.": "Lukas",
  "The first time I got pregnant, I was a young girl - I was 17 years old. Although I knew right away that I wanted to keep my child, being a pregnant teen was an extremely scary experience for me. Luckily, my family and friends were very supportive and were there for me every step of the way.": "Paula",
  "Nobody understands anyone 18, including those who are 18.": "Jim",
  "As I've said many times, the single most oppressed class in America right now is the teenager.": "Joe",
  "I've never done a teen movie before, but I certainly could tell you some of the ones I came very close on. I was very close on Clueless and She's All That.": "Mia",
  "I grew up in a small town in Kansas, so I love meeting the fans. Those are the people who spend time out of their day to watch the things that I've done, and I've gotten to do some great supernatural stuff - 'Teen Wolf' and 'The Gates' before that - so it's nice when I get to go to Comic-Con every year.": "Colton",
  "I think doing 'Teen Wolf' is just giving me a really great opportunity to possibly get other jobs and show what I can do.": "Colton",
  "I think the fans from the original 'Teen Wolf' tuned in expecting us to ruin the franchise, and I think that we've only heightened it. So we've brought 'Teen Wolf' back.": "Colton",
  "To be honest, and this is terrible to admit, I hardly read any teen mystery books at all.": "John",
  "I absolutely adore classic crime and read a huge amount as a teen - Agatha Christie, Dorothy L. Sayers, Sherlock Holmes, Josephine Tey, and many more.": "Ruth",
  "But when I was a teenager, the idea of spending the rest of my life in a factory was real depressing. So the idea that I could become a musician opened up some possibilities I didn't see otherwise.": "Wayne",
  "I take mentoring very seriously and I am on the board of an organization called Girls Write Now, where we match teen girls and writing mentors because it changes their lives.": "Tayari",
  "I think there's actually a benefit to working with teen actors: they've got such boundless energy, and everybody is willing to try different things.": "Peyton",
  "As a white teen, I was very drawn to hip-hop culture, almost to the point of disappearing in it - there was a sense of having no sense of authenticity except this one that wasn't mine.": "Jess",
  "I love being a teen because you don't have all the responsibilities of an adult yet.": "Elizabeth",
  "I don't want to be a 'teen star' because so many people don't ever grow out of that.": "Lacey",
  "I did work at a mall in college - I think retail/customer service is just one of the most hideous jobs in the world. So I always try to be extra nice when I go into a store. But malls are part of our culture, if you watched any teen comedy in the '80s. it's clear that malls are where we live!": "Jayma",
  "When I was growing up, particularly during puberty in my teen years, I was so miserable because I elicited so much teasing and meanness from my teenage cohorts.": "Linda",
  "The distinction has blurred between young adult and adult books. Some of the teen books have become more sophisticated.": "Ann",
  "Cartoons are the best stuff on TV. 'Wonder Showzen,' 'Aqua Teen,' 'SpongeBob,' and, of course, 'South Park' - one of the funniest shows ever made.": "Akiva",
  "I write edgy, sexy teen romances, and that's what I'll continue to do.": "Simone",
  "'Teen Beach Movie' was a lot of fun because we were in Puerto Rico on an island - you can't even call it work!": "Ross",
  "I have always had a sense that we are all pretty much alone in life, particularly in adolescence.": "Robert",
  "In the Top 40, half the songs are secret messages to the teen world to drop out, turn on, and groove with the chemicals and light shows at discotheques.": "Art",
  "I'm a teen boy, so I like seeing blood and guts. I know it's fake, but I'm having fun.": "Chandler",
  "You need to know what makes artists tick. Having been through the process myself as a musician, since I was an early teen, gave me an advantage - understanding them from their point of view, because it's about them, it's not about you - it's their vision and what they're capable of achieving, and you're the conduit.": "Tommy",
  "And at some point I would like to talk my publisher into doing an anthology of my poetry alongside some teen readers' poetry. It would be fun, and really wonderful to get their stuff out there.": "Ellen",
  "I didn't know what was going to happen with 'Teen Wolf.' I was only scheduled to do four episodes for them, but they kept me on, and I was like, 'Sweet! I'm still employed! That's awesome!' And then, they let me know that they were considering having me for the second half of the season.": "Adelaide",
  "I'm still good friends with everybody from 'Teen Wolf.' I still see them, and I go to Jeff Davis' for 'Teen Wolf' night when I can. It was such a rewarding experience. That's such a fun set.": "Adelaide",
  "I pass on a lot of teen roles that get sent to me because a lot of the time it doesn't feel real. It's sugar-coated. There's no depth to it.": "Dylan",
  "I started a MySpace teen lit discussion group and invited people to join.": "Sarah",
  "I watch a lot of teen TV and read a lot of YA novels. I also talk to teens whenever I can. There are cultural differences between when I was a teen and now, but emotions - anger, angst, love - are the same.": "Sarah",
  "Maybe that's the whole teen oeuvre, you know covering people in disgusting bodily fluids and whatnot.": "Rider",
  "My high school years were fun and frustrating, typical of the teen years. The most important accomplishment was meeting my wife, Ruth.": "Alan",
  "I'm pretty sure this is it for the teen movie thing. It's so frustrating to read when you get to page 20 and you're like, Oy! It's the same thing again!": "Marla",
  "I love being a part of Aqua Teen.": "Dana",
  "I've always enjoyed the teen angst thing. I had a lot of teen angst as I was growing up, so I think I have a lot to say about it through characters before I have to move on.": "Magda",
  "Just because you have teenagers in a movie doesn't make it a teen movie.": "Brendan",
  "Being a teen is past for me. Worrying about the world and my place in it is not.": "Ally",
  "I could have been on a path that led to different, more traditional teen romance, and 'Nip/Tuck' shook me loose from any generalization I might have been forced into. It helped me understand I wanted to take on things that were edgier, more challenging and riskier.": "Seth",
  "There's a theory about fame: the moment it strikes, it arrests development. Michael Jackson remained suspended in childhood, enjoying sleepovers and funfairs; Winona Ryder, an errant teen who dabbled in shoplifting and experimented with pills; George Clooney, a 30-year-old commitment-phobe, never quite ready yet to settle down.": "Jemima",
  "It's always good to get feedback from people. I've been fortunate that all the fans, and especially fans of 'Teen Wolf,' have been really gracious.": "Sinqua",
  "Of course Stephen King doesn't believe in teen novels. I've started to suspect he doesn't even believe in teenagers.": "Robin",
  "Teen fiction should be about teenagers - no matter how many arguments there are about what YA lit should be, this seems like the one thing we can all agree on.": "Robin",
  "When I turned thirteen and took a typing class, with typical early teen enthusiasm and total lack of critical ability, I started sending my stuff to publishers once I'd babysat long enough to earn the postage.": "Sherwood",
  "Teenagers today are more free to be themselves and to accept themselves.": "John",
  "I think if we were going to worry about teen pregnancy being glamorized, we should worry about shows like 'Teen Mom'. If people are going to want to have children at a young age because they see it on TV, I think that depends on the type of person you're dealing with.": "Chelsea",
  "As a unique person, I was bullied badly as a teen.": "Lady",
  "When I was 14, I came very close to becoming a gay teen suicide 'statistic,' but I then turned to music, my piano, my loved ones, and discovered that it does in fact get better.": "Blake",
  "I don't really think I feel pressured to become a teen sensation because that's not really my goal in life. It's not really about being star, being popular or having lots of girls. It's really about continuing to be able to act and have fun, and do what I like to do.": "Chris",
  "I do a lot of teen shows and voice over work for animation, so when I got the part in 'The Number 23,' it was really cool because now I get to be in a movie with Jim Carrey. Acting in this movie was really a learning experience for me.": "Paul",
  "I actually hope people don't react to 'Impossible' in a way where they think it's terribly retro. The plot needed to do what it needed to do. But I'm a little surprised to find myself looking a little bit like an advocate of teen marriage. It takes some exceptional circumstances for that to be a reasonable idea.": "Nancy",
  "'Catcher in the Rye.' I feel like any brooding teen loves that book.": "Justice",
  "When I got near teen age, I was so happy with my friends and the African-American culture that I couldn't imagine not being part of it.": "Johnny",
  "When I was a freshman, I didn't have that much time for extra-curriculars, so I didn't do any theater stuff. Actually, I didn't do it with my school. I did theater with this thing called Teen Source.": "Shanley",
  "I progressed through so many different styles of music through my teen years, both as a player and a vocalist, particularly the jazz and pop of the early 20th Century.": "Jeff",
  "Maturity is only a short break in adolescence.": "Jules",
  "My own experience being bullied - it made me a more compassionate person. It made me more sympathetic to the adolescent experience.": "Carolyn",
  "My writing books with positive gay characters has come more out of anger than anything else: anger at not having been able to find honest, accurate books about people like myself as a teen, books that show we're as diverse as straight people and that we can lead happy, healthy, productive lives just as straight people can.": "Nancy",
  "Teenage girls read in packs. It's true today, and it was true when I was a teen growing up in a small town in northeast Oklahoma.": "Ally",
  "A departure from the movie with Michael J. Fox, 'Teen Wolf' tells the story of how a group of angsty teens deal with werewolves, their supernatural kin and the world of trouble that comes with it, all while trying to still live their lives.": "Keahu",
  "It hasn't been until the last couple years that I've started playing close to my age. But it's fun playing the younger roles because it takes you back to the teen years.": "Kerr",
  "This is actually something no one knows, but my mom was really the one who created the entire style for 'Teen Witch.' I'm dead serious. She was super involved, and is super creative, so I wore a lot of my actual clothes in the movie. Truly, Louise was my mom's vision. She really created an iconic character.": "Robyn",
  "Because of people like that guy in San Francisco who told me it changed his life, 'Teen Witch' is my most favorite thing I've ever done. I see how happy it makes people, and that makes me happy. The great thing is that no one realized it was going to become all these things when we were making it. We thought we were making a very serious movie.": "Robyn",
  "My younger sister and younger brother are huge 'Teen Witch' fans.": "Robyn",
  "This is actually something no one knows, but my mom was really the one who created the entire style for 'Teen Witch.' I'm dead serious.": "Robyn",
  "I think teen girls will like 'Geek Charming' because they really focus on the 'populars' and nerdy people and people who are in between the nerds and between the populars. So it really hits every category of what girls are going through in high school.": "Lili",
  "There's an indie movie I did called 'Fat Kid Rules the World,' which was based on a teen book, and it's a fabulous story, and hopefully it'll go to theaters because it is an amazing story.": "Lili",
  "'Pretty Little Liars,' you know, it's a teen show that grew to be something bigger. I think you had girls from ages 7 to, like, 20 watching the show, and that was the predominant audience. Then it grew to be for girls, boys, men, women, people who are 7 to 35. I think that's crazy.": "Aeriel",
  "The 'Teen Wolf' fans are so great.": "Charlie",
  "I was a big fan of black gospel. As a kid, there were black groups I sang with from my teen years to my early 20s.": "Cory",
  "Music is probably the only real magic I have encountered in my life. There's not some trick involved with it. It's pure and it's real. It moves, it heals, it communicates and does all these incredible things.": "Tom",
  "Music is a moral law. It gives soul to the universe, wings to the mind, flight to the imagination, and charm and gaiety to life and to everything.": "Plato",
  "To me there is no picture so beautiful as smiling, bright-eyed, happy children; no music so sweet as their clear and ringing laughter.": "P.",
  "Music is a higher revelation than all wisdom and philosophy.": "Ludwig",
  "I think music in itself is healing. It's an explosive expression of humanity. It's something we are all touched by. No matter what culture we're from, everyone loves music.": "Billy",
  "The true beauty of music is that it connects people. It carries a message, and we, the musicians, are the messengers.": "Roy",
  "Sometimes, being different feels a lot like being alone. But with that being said, being true to that and being true to my standards and my way of doing things in my art and my music, everything that has made me feel very different... in the end, it has made me the happiest.": "Lindsey",
  "If you are a chef, no matter how good a chef you are, it's not good cooking for yourself; the joy is in cooking for others - it's the same with music.": "will.i.am",
  "Music, at its essence, is what gives us memories. And the longer a song has existed in our lives, the more memories we have of it.": "Stevie",
  "Some people ask the secret of our long marriage. We take time to go to a restaurant two times a week. A little candlelight, dinner, soft music and dancing. She goes Tuesdays, I go Fridays.": "Henny",
  "Music is the movement of sound to reach the soul for the education of its virtue.": "Plato",
  "Music washes away from the soul the dust of everyday life.": "Berthold",
  "Music should strike fire from the heart of man, and bring tears from the eyes of woman.": "Ludwig",
  "Life is one grand, sweet song, so start the music.": "Ronald",
  "The dance can reveal everything mysterious that is hidden in music, and it has the additional merit of being human and palpable. Dancing is poetry with arms and legs.": "Charles",
  "Without music, life is a journey through a desert.": "Pat",
  "Music is one of the most powerful things the world has to offer. No matter what race or religion or nationality or sexual orientation or gender that you are, it has the power to unite us.": "Lady",
  "Mathematics is the music of reason.": "James",
  "Words make you think a thought. Music makes you feel a feeling. A song makes you feel a thought.": "E.",
  "Music is therapy. Music moves people. It connects people in ways that no other medium can. It pulls heart strings. It acts as medicine.": "Macklemore",
  "Music is the mediator between the spiritual and the sensual life.": "Ludwig",
  "The world is full of poetry. The air is living with its spirit; and the waves dance to the music of its melodies, and sparkle in its brightness.": "James",
  "I enjoy being happy every day, and hopefully you can hear my happiness in my music. Life is beautiful.": "Christina",
  "Complete strangers can stand silent next to each other in an elevator and not even look each other in the eye. But at a concert, those same strangers could find themselves dancing and singing together like best friends. That's the power of music.": "LZ",
  "There's just a completely different vibe at festivals. Everyone gets to hang out and enjoy their favorite music all day. I really do try and play as many festivals as possible!": "Kygo",
  "Beautiful music is the art of the prophets that can calm the agitations of the soul it is one of the most magnificent and delightful presents God has given us. ": "Martin",
  "There is geometry in the humming of the strings, there is music in the spacing of the spheres.": "Pythagoras",
  "I call architecture frozen music.": "Johann",
  "Arts education is a big part of building a 21st century creative mind, and I think that we have let way too many kids lose their way by not drawing in their young minds with music, dance, painting and the other various ways we can express those things we do not have words for.": "Heather",
  "Music drives you. It wakes you up, it gets you pumping. And, at the end of the day, the correct tune will chill you down.": "Dimebag",
  "For me, singing sad songs often has a way of healing a situation. It gets the hurt out in the open into the light, out of the darkness.": "Reba",
  "Music is life itself. What would this world be without good music? No matter what kind it is.": "Louis",
  "Musicians don't retire they stop when there's no more music in them. ": "Louis",
  "Close friends contribute to our personal growth. They also contribute to our personal pleasure, making the music sound sweeter, the wine taste richer, the laughter ring louder because they are there.": "Judith",
  "I was raised in a very humble environment, and I was always taught to be humble to the things that are happening in my life because they're blessings. They're blessings in every way. Whether you're able to help someone get through a tough time in their life through your music or through comedy, or whatever it is, you're just a channel.": "Justin",
  "Music has healing power. It has the ability to take people out of themselves for a few hours.": "Elton",
  "As you begin to realize that every different type of music, everybody's individual music, has its own rhythm, life, language and heritage, you realize how life changes, and you learn how to be more open and adaptive to what is around us.": "Yo-Yo",
  "I try to apply colors like words that shape poems, like notes that shape music.": "Joan",
  "If people take anything from my music, it should be motivation to know that anything is possible as long as you keep working at it and don't back down.": "Eminem",
  "I'm not a pretty princess, and I'm aware of that, so I like music that is really intense, really bold, and characters that in a way almost have a dark side and are kind of evil because, for me, that's when I feel my strongest and fiercest, when I'm not necessarily the good girl.": "Ashley",
  "Sometimes I feel like rap music is almost the key to stopping racism.": "Eminem",
  "I will never forget experiencing Venice for the first time. It feels like you are transported to another time - the art, music, food and pure romance in the air is like no other place.": "Elizabeth",
  "Rock and roll music, if you like it, if you feel it, you can't help but move to it. That's what happens to me. I can't help it.'": "Elvis",
  "I need to listen to chill music when I'm driving. It prevents road rage.": "Aaron",

  "Music is the art of the prophets and the gift of God.": "Martin",

  "Hip-hop is the streets. Hip-hop is a couple of elements that it comes from back in the days... that feel of music with urgency that speaks to you. It speaks to your livelihood and it's not compromised. It's blunt. It's raw, straight off the street - from the beat to the voice to the words.": "Nas",
  "Music doesn't lie. If there is something to be changed in this world, then it can only happen through music.": "Jimi",
  "When I die, I want people to play my music, go wild and freak out and do anything they want to do.": "Jimi",

  "I love music. It's freedom, a way to deal with pent-up frustration.": "Ice",

  "Tones sound, and roar and storm about me until I have set them down in notes.": "Ludwig",
  "I was born with music inside me. Music was one of my parts. Like my ribs, my kidneys, my liver, my heart. Like my blood. It was a force already within me when I arrived on the scene. It was a necessity for me - like food or water.": "Ray",
  "Like sunshine, music is a powerful force that can instantly and almost chemically change your entire mood.": "Michael",
  "There is nothing stable in the world uproar's your only music. ": "John",
  "Hawaii is paradise. It sounds cheesy to say it, but there's music in the air there.": "Bruno",
  "Music should probably provide answers in terms of lyrical content, and giving people a sense of togetherness and oneness, as opposed to being alone in their thoughts and dilemmas or regrets or happiness or whatever.": "Peabo",
  "That's why this generation is the least racist generation ever. You see it all the time. Go to any club. People are intermingling, hanging out, having fun, enjoying the same music. Hip-hop is not just in the Bronx anymore. It's worldwide. Everywhere you go, people are listening to hip-hop and partying together. Hip-hop has done that.": "Jay-Z",
  "Those who decide to use leisure as a means of mental development, who love good music, good books, good pictures, good plays, good company, good conversation - what are they? They are the happiest people in the world.": "William",
  "My body is damaged from music in two ways. I have a red irritation in my stomach. It's psychosomatic, caused by all the anger and the screaming. I have scoliosis, where the curvature of your spine is bent, and the weight of my guitar has made it worse. I'm always in pain, and that adds to the anger in our music.": "Kurt",
  "Of all the music that reached farthest into heaven, it is the beating of a loving heart.": "Henry",
  "Music is an expression of individuality; it's how you see the world. All art is, for that matter. You take how you experience the world, interpret it, and send it out there - express it - whether it's sculpture, dance or singing.": "David",
  "Music comes to me more readily than words.": "Ludwig",
  "Being in Blur has allowed me to travel and hear the music that's being made all over the world.": "Damon",
  "I feel like skateboarding is as much of a sport as a lifestyle, and an art form, so there's so much that that transcends in terms of music, fashion, and entertainment.": "Tony",
  "A film is - or should be - more like music than like fiction. It should be a progression of moods and feelings. The theme, what's behind the emotion, the meaning, all that comes later.": "Stanley",
  "To me, movies and music go hand in hand. When I'm writing a script, one of the first things I do is find the music I'm going to play for the opening sequence.": "Quentin",
  "Music inflames temperament.": "Jim",
  "My music is the spiritual expression of what I am - my faith, my knowledge, my being.": "John",
  "Cinematography is infinite in its possibilities... much more so than music or language.": "Conrad",
  "Fun can happen on the interior. Nobody knows about it, but there are fireworks going on inside your spirit when you hear a great orchestra playing great music.": "David",
  "I don't care what people think of me, unless they think I'm mean or something, but I don't care if they think I'm like someone else because I know I'm not - I'm a total weirdo. I'm not selling a dream; I'm not selling fame like it is some sort of fantastic thing. I'm just trying to sell music and get on with my real life.": "Sia",
  "Film is one of the three universal languages, the other two: mathematics and music.": "Frank",
  "On the other hand, what I like my music to do to me is awaken the ghosts inside of me. Not the demons, you understand, but the ghosts.": "David",
  "Music is moonlight in the gloomy night of life.": "Jean",
  "The wise musicians are those who play what they can master.": "Duke",
  "Basically, radio hasn't changed over the years. Despite all the technical improvements, it still boils down to a man or a woman and a microphone, playing music, sharing stories, talking about issues - communicating with an audience.": "Casey",
  "Music is the harmonious voice of creation an echo of the invisible world. ": "Giuseppe",
  "Music is everybody's possession. It's only publishers who think that people own it.": "John",
  "The spiral in a snail's shell is the same mathematically as the spiral in the Milky Way galaxy, and it's also the same mathematically as the spirals in our DNA. It's the same ratio that you'll find in very basic music that transcends cultures all over the world.": "Joseph",

  "Music is my religion.": "Jimi",
  "People haven't always been there for me, but music always has.": "Taylor",

  "In string theory, all particles are vibrations on a tiny rubber band; physics is the harmonies on the string; chemistry is the melodies we play on vibrating strings; the universe is a symphony of strings, and the 'Mind of God' is cosmic music resonating in 11-dimensional hyperspace.": "Michio",
  "I basically taught myself how to DJ, but I've been inspired by DJs throughout my whole career. I have some good friends that would hook us up with music. You learn some little things here and there from each DJ and you just take it and put your own style into to it.": "Pauly",
  "There's nothing better than live music. It's raw energy, and raw energy feeds the soul.": "Dhani",
  "Music is the best way for me to say I love you.": "Mireille",
  "Music washes away the dust of every day life.": "Art",
  "A lot of music is mathematics. It's balance.": "Mel",
  "Gospel music to me has always been a balm for the soul. It has been able to usher in the spirit, usher in worship, true worship and praise, healing. I find the music to be very good at healing and the passion, you know, which is a testimony being told in song.": "Kim",
  "People today are still living off the table scraps of the sixties. They are still being passed around - the music and the ideas.": "Bob",

  "My music fights against the system that teaches to live and die.": "Bob",
  "Military justice is to justice what military music is to music.": "Groucho",
  "I liberate minds with my music. That's more important than liberating a few people from apartheid or whatever.": "Kanye",
  "The history of the music industry is inevitably also the story of the development of technology. From the player piano to the vinyl disc, from reel-to-reel tape to the cassette, from the CD to the digital download, these formats and devices changed not only the way music was consumed, but the very way artists created it.": "Edgar",
  "I found that dance, music, and literature is how I made sense of the world... it pushed me to think of things bigger than life's daily routines... to think beyond what is immediate or convenient.": "Mikhail",

  "Jazz music is to be played sweet, soft, plenty rhythm.": "Jelly",
  "Music is the emotional life of most people.": "Leonard",
  "You have to open your mind. I like the ability to express myself in a deep way. It's the closest music to our humanity - it's like a folk music that rises up out of a culture.": "Sonny",
  "I think the feelings in my music were suggested to me before I even had the ability to play music.": "John",
  "Yoga is almost like music in a way there's no end to it. ": "Sting",
  "You are the music while the music lasts.": "T.",
  "It's funny how the music industry is enraged about the Internet and the way things are copied without being paid for. But you know why people steal the music? Because they can't afford the music.": "Tom",
  "If you don't die of thirst, there are blessings in the desert. You can be pulled into limitlessness, which we all yearn for, or you can do the beauty of minutiae, the scrimshaw of tiny and precise. The sky is your ocean, and the crystal silence will uplift you like great gospel music, or Neil Young.": "Anne",
  "Bluegrass has brought more people together and made more friends than any music in the world. You meet people at festivals and renew acquaintances year after year.": "Bill",
  "Music is therapy for me. It's my outlet for every negative thing I've ever been through. It lets me turn something bad into something beautiful.": "Amy",

  "It's very strange how electronic music formatted itself and forgot that its roots are about the surprise, freedom, and the acceptance of every race, gender, and style of music into this big party. Instead, it started to become this electronic lifestyle which also involved the glorification of technology.": "Thomas",
  "If you talk bad about country music, it's like saying bad things about my momma. Them's fightin' words.": "Dolly",

  "Where there is devotional music, God is always at hand with His gracious presence.": "Johann",
  "Whether looking at pop music, hip-hop or R&B, it's rare to find an artist who hasn't been touched or affected by the power and soul of gospel music. In fact, many of today's popular artists such as Whitney Houston, John Legend, and Katy Perry started their careers in the church choir.": "Marvin",
  "All music is escapism for me, but I like the way that, on a good night, that sense of escapism can be shared.": "Jamie",
  "Music is your own experience, your own thoughts, your wisdom. If you don't live it, it won't come out of your horn. They teach you there's a boundary line to music. But, man, there's no boundary line to art.": "Charlie",
  "Music became a healer for me. And I learned to listen with all my being. I found that it could wipe away all the emotions of fear and confusion relating to my family.": "Eric",
  "Music can name the unnameable and communicate the unknowable.": "Leonard",
  "Music is a safe kind of high.": "Jimi",
  "I think every revolutionary act is an act of love. Every song that I've written, it is because of my desire to use music as a way to empower and re-humanize people who are living in a dehumanizing setting. The song is in order to better the human condition.": "Zack",
  "It is so important for people at a young age to be invited to embrace classical music and opera.": "Luciano",
  "I have been able to tap into all the negative things that can happen to me throughout my life by numbing myself to the pain so to speak and kind of being able to vent it through my music.": "Chester",
  "Things can be really empty in this world, and I don't just mean the music world. It can become a very meaningless place if you don't really understand: 'who am I? Why am I here? What am I doing?' To feel fulfilment and have a deeper level of understanding, personally, that is the most important thing.": "Alicia",
  "I don't come from a film background. I haven't learned anything about films or film-making. But I have a thirst to know everything about my profession. I want to learn about cinematography, about editing, about music recordings, about post-production. So when people in the know talk, I willingly listen.": "Priyanka",
  "I don't listen to a lot of new stuff. I just like the old stuff. It's all quite dramatic and atmospheric. You'd have an entire story in song. I never listen to, like, white music - I couldn't sing you a Zeppelin or Floyd song.": "Amy",
  "Perhaps of all the most basic elements of music, rhythm most directly affects our central nervous system.": "George",
  "I need drama in my life to keep making music.": "Eminem",
  "Music is the voice that tells us that the human race is greater than it knows.": "Napoleon",

  "Mozart's music is so pure and beautiful that I see it as a reflection of the inner beauty of the universe.": "Albert",
  "It was my 16th birthday - my mom and dad gave me my Goya classical guitar that day. I sat down, wrote this song, and I just knew that that was the only thing I could ever really do - write songs and sing them to people.": "Stevie",
  "Soul music is true to its name. It's music that connects to your soul, your spirit. When music resonates with people's spirit like that, when people can emotionally connect with something or it helps to heal them, transform them, that never goes out of style. People will always need something to relate to.": "Andra",
  "I have never denied my background or my culture. I have taught my child to embrace her Mexican heritage, to love my first language, Spanish, to learn about Mexican history, music, folk art, food, and even the Mexican candy I grew up with.": "Salma",
  "Just when you think we're living in a little bit of a divided world, music brings us together.": "Luis",
  "Jazz is a white term to define black people. My music is black classical music.": "Nina",
  "For my birthday this year, my girlfriends - who knew I'd just inherited my dad's turntable - gave me a carton of albums like 'Blue Kentucky Girl,' by Emmylou Harris, and 'Off the Wall,' by Michael Jackson. It's all stuff we grew up with. I mean, you can't have a music collection without Prince's 'Purple Rain' - it just can't be done!": "Connie",
  "Opera is the ultimate art form. It has singing and music and drama and dance and emotion and story.": "Diane",
  "I would go to sleep with headphones on. My mom and pop - they would have music loud enough to shake the walls.": "Dr.",
  "Disco is music for dancing, and people will always want to dance.": "Giorgio",
  "I would love to continue in music, with writing... but I am not the kind of person who will hang around if I start to become irrelevant. If that happens, I will bow down gracefully, raise my kids, and have a garden. And I am going to let my hair go gray when I am older. I don't need to be blonde when I'm 60!": "Taylor",
  "I think I first realized I wanted to be in country music and be an artist when I was 10. And I started dragging my parents to festivals, and fairs, and karaoke contests, and I did that for about a year before I came to Nashville for the first time. I was 11 and I had this demo CD of me singing Dixie Chicks and Leanne Rimes songs.": "Taylor",
  "I definitely try to be myself and not try to imitate other performers. That's why I got my music degree. I wanted to be prepared and not be a 'product.' I want people to know that I'm not only a singer but a musician as well. I studied guitar, piano, and composition. I believe that it's just about being myself on and off stage.": "Luis",
  "The standardization of world culture, with local popular or traditional forms driven out or dumbed down to make way for American television, American music, food, clothes and films, has been seen by many as the very heart of globalization.": "Fredric",
  "Of all noises, I think music is the least disagreeable.": "Samuel",
  "A big part of making music is the discovery aspect, is the surprise aspect. That's why I think I'll always love sampling. Because it involves combining the music fandom: collecting, searching, discovering music history, and artifacts of recording that you may not have known existed and you just kind of unlock parts of your brain, you know?": "Gotye",
  "The idea of music is to liberate the listener and lead him to a frame where he feels he is elevated.": "A.",
  "Filmmaking is a very complex form - ya know, acting, lighting, screenwriting, storytelling, music, editing - all these things have to come together.": "Jay",
  "Music is the medicine of the mind.": "John",
  "There are more love songs than anything else. If songs could make you do something we'd all love one another.": "Frank",
  "My music had roots which I'd dug up from my own childhood, musical roots buried in the darkest soil.": "Ray",
  "What is a poet? An unhappy person who conceals profound anguish in his heart but whose lips are so formed that as sighs and cries pass over them they sound like beautiful music.": "Soren",
  "Rock music is not meant to be perfect.": "Ozzy",
  "Music is my life, it is a reflection of what I go through.": "Lenny",
  "I'm very easily distracted unless I have music on. Listening to music while I brainstorm makes me think of scenes that would fit the mood of the music I'm playing.": "Maggie",
  "When wheat is ripening properly, when the wind is blowing across the field, you can hear the beards of the wheat rubbing together. They sound like the pine needles in a forest. It is a sweet, whispering music that once you hear, you never forget.": "Norman",
  "Film music should have the same relationship to the film drama that somebody's piano playing in my living room has on the book I am reading.": "Igor",
  "Music is a language, you see, a universal language.": "Sun",
  "I definitely shut down sometimes. I always just go into my own little cocoon and write, and I surround myself with as much music as possible. The last girlfriend I had, when we broke up, I remember being in a room for days on days on days with my music cranked up, playing songs like Kanye's '808's & Heartbreak.' That playlist just was long!": "Tristan",
  "Music does a lot of things for a lot of people. It's transporting, for sure. It can take you right back, years back, to the very moment certain things happened in your life. It's uplifting, it's encouraging, it's strengthening.": "Aretha",
  "I've been designing since I was 8. I started sketching dresses I could wear when skating. I was always involved in all aspects of skating, not just the technique, the choreography, the music, but the visual aspects, too - what I should wear.": "Vera",
  "Tintinnabulation is an area I sometimes wander into when I am searching for answers - in my life, my music, my work. In my dark hours, I have the certain feeling that everything outside this one thing has no meaning.": "Arvo",
  "He who joyfully marches to music in rank and file has already earned my contempt. He has been given a large brain by mistake, since for him the spinal cord would suffice.": "Albert",
  "You have the sun, you have the moon, you have the air that you breathe - and you have the Rolling Stones!": "Keith",
  "I don't care much about music. What I like is sounds.": "Dizzy",
  "When people hear good music, it makes them homesick for something they never had, and never will have.": "E.",
  "As long as my music is real, it's no limit to how many ears I can grab.": "Kendrick",
  "When you go to a great concert, you feel this arc, almost like the music of a well-chosen set takes you on this trip through emotions and through various forms of intellectual engagement.": "John",
  "I love music of all kinds, but there's no greater music than the sound of my grandchildren laughing; my kids, too.": "Sylvia",
  "All that stuff about heavy metal and hard rock, I don't subscribe to any of that. It's all just music. I mean, the heavy metal from the Seventies sounds nothing like the stuff from the Eighties, and that sounds nothing like the stuff from the Nineties. Who's to say what is and isn't a certain type of music?": "Ozzy",
  "I listen to all types of different music. I go to different festivals. I'm around music.": "Rico",
  "Classical music requires an immense amount of concentration, and I don't know if I would've been that committed to that particular life.": "Questlove",
  "As a DJ, people expect a certain sound and a certain danceability for the music. As a producer, I really like to let go of any rules that may exist.": "Armin",
  "I think country music is popular - has been popular and will always be popular because I think a lot of real people singing about a lot of real stuff about real people. And it's simple enough for people to understand it. And we kind of roll with the punches.": "Dolly",
  "I'm happy to be on a winning team. My individual success, that lasts for a short period of time. The success of being a part of the South, of Atlanta, which is now the hot bed of music, that's what's gonna last the longest. The fact that I contributed to planting our flag and moving music to my city, that's what I'm most proud of.": "T.I.",
  "Stockholm is unique in that it's built on islands and surrounded by water, so you get this enormous sense of freedom. It's got everything you could possibly need - everything New York or London has but without all the people and traffic. It's also become a very creative city, not only for music but also for fashion and computer games.": "Bjorn",
  "Making words rhyme for a living is one of the great joys of my life... That's a superpower I've been very conscious of developing. I started at the same level as everybody else, and then I just listened to more music and talked to myself until it was an actual superpower I could pull out on special occasions.": "Lin-Manuel",
  "We need to take music out of the ivory tower - both for musicians and for the public. Otherwise, classical music will not survive the 21st century.": "Daniel",
  "I am a person who thinks about the music first in trying to achieve something musically valid.": "Sonny",
  "Soul music is timeless.": "Alicia",
  "You can't fake this music. You might be a great singer or a great musician but, in the need, that's got nothing to do with it. It's how you connect to the songs and to the history behind them.": "Etta",
  "Music is really driving my whole life.": "Ariana",
  "The paradox is that I have no love for myself as a human being, but I have immense pride in the music I make, and I believe it has an important place. Others do, too, and the thousands of people with Morrissey tattoos certainly proves something.": "Morrissey",
  "Soul music is about longevity and reaching and touching people on a human level - and that's never going to get lost.": "Jill",
  "My best hostess tip is to have good food and really good music!": "Jennifer",
  "Food is one part of the experience. And it has to be somewhere between 50 to 60 percent of the dining experience. But the rest counts as well: The mood, the atmosphere, the music, the feeling, the design, the harmony between what you have on the plate and what surrounds the plate.": "Alain",
  "It's very easy for people to put out music.": "Charlie",
  "I have a sweet tooth for song and music. This is my Polish sin.": "Pope",

  "It is not the money but the self-respect and wanting to create good music.": "Barry",
  "The century of airplanes has a right to its own music.": "Claude",
  "That's my fun time so, to me, doing my homework, studying on what I do, watching the movies, listening to music, all that inspires me so I focus a lot on that and practice.": "Christina",
  "If you look at music, you see theme, variation, you see symmetry, asymmetry, you see structure, and these are related to skills in the real world.": "Dave",
  "A good compromise, a good piece of legislation, is like a good sentence; or a good piece of music. Everybody can recognize it. They say, 'Huh. It works. It makes sense.'": "Barack",
  "This land is your land and this land is my land, sure, but the world is run by those that never listen to music anyway.": "Bob",
  "I think older people can appreciate my music because I really show my heart when I sing, and it's not corny. I think I can grow as an artist, and my fans will grow with me.": "Justin",
  "The basis of our partnership strategy and our partnership approach: We build the social technology. They provide the music.": "Mark",
  "Music has always been my protection against the world, from a very young age. I feel safe inside of a jam.": "Trey",
  "I'm not a lyric writer to make statements. What I enjoy doing is making paintings with lyrics, creating colorful images. I think that's more what entertainment and music should be.": "Chris",
  "I try to greet my friends with a drink in my hand, a warm smile on my face, and great music in the background, because that's what gets a dinner party off to a fun start.": "Ina",
  "A nation that has no music and no fairytales is a tragedy.": "Ai",
  "When you write a play, you work out like a musician on a piece of music. You find all the rhythms and the melody and the harmonies and take them as they come.": "Sam",
  "There's something missing in the music industry today... and it's music. Songs you hear don't last, it's just product fed to you by the industry.": "Jimmy",
  "I have absorbed my life now. I am ready for my music to unfold. I know time flies, but before the end of this year, the album will be out. Even if it kills me.": "Neneh",
  "Musicians should not play music. Music should play musicians.": "Henry",
  "People don't appreciate music any more. They don't adore it. They don't buy vinyl and just love it. They love their laptops like their best friend, but they don't love a record for its sound quality and its artwork.": "Laura",
  "Nevertheless the passions, whether violent or not, should never be so expressed as to reach the point of causing disgust; and music, even in situations of the greatest horror, should never be painful to the ear but should flatter and charm it, and thereby always remain music.": "Wolfgang",
  "We'd like to think that our music will always be bigger than any one of our individual personalities.": "Chester",
  "Rock music should be gross: that's the fun of it. It gets up and drops its trousers.": "Bruce",
  "I don't know, my music has always just come from where the wind blew me. Like where I'm at during a particular moment in time.": "Tom",
  "How you act, walk, look and talk is all part of Hip Hop culture. And the music is colorless. Hip Hop music is made from Black, brown, yellow, red and white.": "Afrika",
  "Lean your body forward slightly to support the guitar against your chest, for the poetry of the music should resound in your heart.": "Andres",
  "It's very easy to be cynical about the hall of fame. But on the other hand, it's really a beautiful thing for someone like me. I dedicated my entire life to this music.": "Tom",
  "With so many ways to communicate at our disposal, we must not forget the transformative power of a live music experience and genuine human exchange.": "Jon",
  "Personally, I just think rap music is the best thing out there, period. If you look at my deck in my car radio, you're always going to find a hip-hop tape; that's all I buy, that's all I live, that's all I listen to, that's all I love.": "Eminem",
  "How to play music may be known. At the commencement of the piece, all the parts should sound together. As it proceeds, they should be in harmony while severally distinct and flowing without break, and thus on to the conclusion.": "Confucius",
  "We should make decisions in life with our hearts, not our brains, not only in music but in daily life.": "Andre",
  "There is a sound that comes from gospel music that doesn't come from anything else. It is a sound of peace. It is a sound of, 'I'm going to make it through all of this.'": "Yolanda",
  "I think in London - and I don't wanna offend anybody in America, but this is a real statement - they still have the right approach to making music. In the U.S., people see it as a way to make money; they see it as a means to get out. It's a hustle, which is great - any way you can provide for your family that's legal is fantastic.": "Jay-Z",
  "My liberty is about living. It's about spreading more love. Even though I was always a peaceful, loving individual, my music sometimes didn't reflect that. But now it's different. My music is reflecting the way I feel.": "Snoop",
  "Music is essentially an emotional language, so you want to feel something from the relationships and build music based on those feelings.": "Howard",
  "I try to make music with emotion and integrity. And authenticity. You can feel when something's authentic, and you can feel when it's not: you know when someone's trying to make the club record, or trying to make the girl record, or trying to make the thug record. It's none of that. It's just my emotions.": "Jay-Z",
  "I suffer from deep depression, so my only release is music.": "Kevin",
  "For me, music and life are all about style.": "Miles",
  "Music's been around a long time, and there's going to be music long after Ray Charles is dead. I just want to make my mark, leave something musically good behind. If it's a big record, that's the frosting on the cake, but music's the main meal.": "Ray",
  "You walk off the plane in Rio, and your blood temperature goes up. The feel of the wind on your face, the water on your skin, the taste of the food, the music, the sexuality; Brazilians are very comfortable in their sexuality.": "Amy",
  "Music is my main goal, but I'm not going to rush a record out. There are so many actors who have come out with albums these days. I don't want to do it because it's the thing to do. I want to wait until the time is right.": "River",
  "For me, music making is the most joyful activity possible, the most perfect expression of any emotion.": "Luciano",
  "The Internet is both great and terrible. As a source of information, a tool for delivering music and art, it's great. But spamming ads and piracy of music is terrible. It's stealing.": "Gary",
  "I grew up around salsa, merengue, bachata, bass music, freestyle, hip-hop, techno, house, rave.": "Pitbull",

  "Music, in performance, is a type of sculpture. The air in the performance is sculpted into something.": "Frank",

  "I don't make music for eyes. I make music for ears.": "Adele",
  "Blues is my life. It's a true feeling that comes from the heart, not something that just comes out of my mouth. Blues is what I love, and blues is what I always do.": "Koko",
  "This will be our reply to violence: to make music more intensely, more beautifully, more devotedly than ever before.": "Leonard",
  "A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to be ultimately at peace with himself.": "Abraham",
  "The type of music I make, it's not just straight-up rapping. There's emotion in it. That's why people feel each song differently. I get all my vibes from rock music, you know? All my melodies and all that.": "Lil",
  "The blues. It runs through all American music. Somebody bending the note. The other is the two-beat groove. It's in New Orleans music, it's in jazz, it's in country music, it's in gospel.": "Wynton",
  "Good fashion is like rock music: all anarchy and revolt.": "Ann",
  "The ecstatic insanity of romantic pursuit can be so enhanced by music that entire romantic conquests, victories and ruinous, crushing defeats can be tied to songs to such a degree that it's almost unbearable to listen to them again, as they bring back the memories so vividly.": "Henry",
  "Feelings such as loneliness, longing or love are sometimes hard to put into words; maybe that's why we all love music, because it resonates with something we can't share.": "Agnes",
  "People speculate on your personal life all the time anyway. So I just think it's important to keep my private life private and my public persona more into music, you know?": "Prince",
  "Through literacy you can begin to see the universe. Through music you can reach anybody. Between the two there is you, unstoppable.": "Grace",
  "Hip-Hop isn't just music, it is also a spiritual movement of the blacks! You can't just call Hip-Hop a trend!": "Lauryn",
  "I know what I've done for music, but don't call me a legend. Just call me Miles Davis.": "Miles",
  "Motown was about music for all people - white and black, blue and green, cops and the robbers. I was reluctant to have our music alienate anyone.": "Berry",
  "When I think of music, I think of music in its totality, complete. From the lowest blues to the highest symphony, you know, so what I'd like to do is exemplify each style of as many periods as I can possibly do.": "Donny",
  "I'm inspired by artists and musicians. There are so many wonderful and talented people in the world. I love discovering new music, new writers, or new art.": "Alicia",
  "Our world is enriched when coders and marketers dazzle us with smartphones and tablets, but, by themselves, they are just slabs. It is the music, essays, entertainment and provocations that they access, spawned by the humanities, that animate them - and us.": "Nicholas",
  "Beethoven can write music, thank God, but he can do nothing else on earth.": "Ludwig",
  "May not music be described as the mathematics of the sense, mathematics as music of the reason? The musician feels mathematics, the mathematician thinks music: music the dream, mathematics the working life.": "James",
  "The end of all good music is to affect the soul.": "Claudio",
  "Dre was one of my heros in the music industry. If he's not down for his homeboys, I don't wanna be a part of him or around him.": "Tupac",
  "All art constantly aspires towards the condition of music.": "Walter",
  "Some people create with words or with music or with a brush and paints. I like to make something beautiful when I run. I like to make people stop and say, 'I've never seen anyone run like that before.' It's more than just a race, it's a style. It's doing something better than anyone else. It's being creative.": "Steve",
  "Music is gathering. Taking our scattered thoughts and senses and coalescing us back into our core. Music is powerful. The first few chords can change us where no self-help books can.": "Jane",
  "New Orleans is unlike any city in America. Its cultural diversity is woven into the food, the music, the architecture - even the local superstitions. It's a sensory experience on all levels and there's a story lurking around every corner.": "Ruta",
  "The flame that is naturally clear always gives the most light and heat. If I could blend my talent for poetry and music into one, the light would burn still clearer, and I might go far.": "Robert",
  "If something happened where I couldn't write music anymore, it would kill me. It's not just a job. It's not just a hobby. It's why I get up in the morning.": "Hans",
  "Heartbreak was the impetus to me writing poems and music in the first place. Over the years, I had my heart broken so badly that if I didn't find a way to get all the pain out, I was going to lose my mind. I was crazy! Like, wanting to slash tires and smash car windows. Crazy! I was so hurt that I had to write.": "Jill",
  "If you ever go to a music session, you'll notice that the musicians can sit down and start playing right away, and everyone knows what to do. Of course they're reading it, but the conductor can tweak little things, and you can take that back to directing motion pictures.": "Clint",
  "In Jamaica, them always have throwback riddims, recycled old beats, and the hardcore reggae scene is always present. You have faster stuff like the more commercialized stuff, but you always have that segment of music that is always from the core, from the original root of it.": "Damian",
  "One of my favorite places I've visited is Havana, Cuba. On my way home from Costa Rica, I did a week in Havana. The colors, the music, the beautiful men and the cars! I love vintage and antique cars and own a couple myself.": "Megalyn",
  "I'm a DJ who makes dance music who got to play with Sting.": "Afrojack",
  "Oratory is the masterful art. Poetry, painting, music, sculpture, architecture please, thrill, inspire - but oratory rules. The orator dominates those who hear him, convinces their reason, controls their judgment, compels their action. For the time being, he is master.": "David",
  "For me, I actually come from an electronic dance music background: house music, electro house, trance music, even. When I was coming out of school, basically, I discovered Brain Fever, Flying Lotus, J Dilla and all that. That was when I got excited about hip-hop and when the Flume project started.": "Flume",
  "I completely love playing and designing games and always will. I am so into games that I listen to game music all day. That may sound strange, but you can guarantee I'm a hardcore gamer and would never let you down by designing a crappy title.": "John",
  "It takes a real soldier to stay in the music industry and live off the things that have been put before me and be able to survive all this time because it has not been easy.": "Chubby",
  "Disco music in the '70s was just a call to go wild and party and dance with no thought or conscience or regard for tomorrow.": "Martha",
  "Nothing pleases me more than to go into a room and come out with a piece of music.": "Paul",
  "I wonder if anyone else has an ear so tuned and sharpened as I have, to detect the music, not of the spheres, but of earth, subtleties of major and minor chord that the wind strikes upon the tree branches. Have you ever heard the earth breathe?": "Kate",
  "Rock and Roll: Music for the neck downwards.": "Keith",
  "The power of music in Spanish is so strong, that I couldn't stay away from it any longer.": "Enrique",
  "I think of a piece of music as something that comes alive when it is being performed, and I feel that my role in the transmission of music is to be its best advocate at that moment.": "Yo-Yo",
  "Jazz isn't dead yet. It's the underpinning of everything in this country. Whether it's a Broadway show, or fusion, or right on through classical music, if it's coming out of the U.S., it's not going to survive unless it's got some jazz influence.": "Dave",
  "There was nothing more I wanted to do than to see my dad react well to my music. I still do. I send him my demos all the time.": "Dan",
  "I'm not a fan of anybody music who I feel like a sucka. I don't listen to you. They play you in the club, you can have the #1 jam, but if I know your character, how can I listen to your music?": "Gucci",
  "The best music happens when you have a personal connection to it. That same philosophy can extend to the instrument you hold in your hands: if a guitar means something special, you're bound to do great things with it.": "Frank",
  "I love all kinds of art. I mean, I love sketching and acting and music.": "Amandla",
  "I used to do crazy things that people would bail me out of, and I'm just grateful that I survived. But the music got very lost; I didn't know where I was going, and I didn't really care. I was more into just having a good time, and I think it showed.": "Eric",
  "A lot of people ask me, 'How did you have the courage to walk up to record labels when you were 12 or 13 and jump right into the music industry?' It's because I knew I could never feel the kind of rejection that I felt in middle school. Because in the music industry, if they're gonna say no to you, at least they're gonna be polite about it.": "Taylor",
  "The star thing I can live with. The music I can't live without. And that's how it lays out for me, you know. I got as big an ego and enjoy the attention.": "Bruce",
  "I think people are tired of fake music, man. And there's a lot of it. Technology has reached the point where any boob can walk into a studio and with a little AutoTuning you can have a hit song. I think it's pathetic.": "Corey",
  "Country music has to evolve in order to survive.": "Blake",
  "The martial music of every sideburned delinquent on the face of the earth.": "Frank",
  "Music conveys moods and images. Even in opera, where plots deal with the structure of destiny, it's music, not words, that provides power.": "Marcel",
  "When you work you are a flute through whose heart the whispering of the hours turns to music. Which of you would be a reed, dumb and silent, when all else sings together in unison?": "Khalil",
  "Music was invented to confirm human loneliness.": "Lawrence",
  "The opera is to music what a bawdy house is to a cathedral.": "H.",
  "Music is given to us with the sole purpose of establishing an order in things, including, and particularly, the coordination between man and time.": "Igor",
  "Music, I feel, must be emotional first and intellectual second.": "Maurice",
  "I dare suggest that the composer would do himself and his music an immediate and eventual service by total, resolute and voluntary withdrawal from this public world to one of private performance and electronic media.": "Milton",
  "It's so wonderful... if your whole day is rotten, once they start the music, it seems to melt away.": "Donald",
  "The ideal situation would be to bypass all of the drama and mayhem and just get the music right to the people. I'm confident that we'll eventually figure it out.": "Debbie",
  "I would like a man now who is rich, and who can give me a boat - a sailboat. I want to own it and let him pay for it. My first love is the sea and water, not music. Music is second.": "Nina",
  "Music is a lady that I still love because she gives me the air that I breathe. We need all sorts of nourishment. And music satisfies and nourishes the hunger within ourselves for connection and harmony.": "Cat",
  "You've seen one of the our gigs you've seen 'em all. But if you're into the music, you'll know that we played better the night before or we can play better.": "Liam",
  "Although technical discussions are interesting to composers, I suspect that the truly magical and spiritual powers of music arise from deeper levels of our psyche.": "George",
  "There's so much beautiful music in the world, and the kids are getting robbed.": "Billy",
  "Hunting, fishing, drawing, and music occupied my every moment. Cares I knew not, and cared naught about them.": "John",
  "All old music was modern once, and much more of the music of yesterday already sounds more old-fashioned than works which were written three centuries ago.": "Peter",
  "There's nothing to compare to live music, there just isn't anything.": "Gloria",
  "I have music inside me and I'm very lucky to be able to play music and that's the way that I try to do it.": "Charlie",
  "So I think it was a good thing It was a little surreal watching Leo scream 'I'm not going to die today!' with our music playing - that was the last thing on my mind when I wrote the song.": "Jon",
  "I take a baths all the time. I'll put on some music and burn some incense and just sit in the tub and think, Wow, life is great right now.": "Brian",
  "I don't listen to my own music at home.": "Celine",
  "There are only two things worth aiming for, good music and a clean conscience.": "Paul",
  "What I am looking for... is an immobile movement, something which would be the equivalent of what is called the eloquence of silence, or what St. John of the Cross, I think it was, described with the term 'mute music'.": "Joan",
  "I mean, if you turn on the radio, love is 90 percent of the music.": "Enrique",
  "Coldplay are just four friends trying to make great music.": "Will",
  "The saxophone is a very interesting machine, but I'm more interested in music.": "Steve",
  "I've never believed that pop music is escapist trash. There's always a darkness in it, even amidst great pop music.": "Thom",
  "My early childhood memories center around this typical American country store and life in a small American town, including 4th of July celebrations marked by fireworks and patriotic music played from a pavilion bandstand.": "Frederick",
  "My horizon on humanity is enlarged by reading the writers of poems, seeing a painting, listening to some music, some opera, which has nothing at all to do with a volatile human condition or struggle or whatever. It enriches me as a human being.": "Wole",
  "The character of instrumental music... lets the emotions radiate and shine in their own character without presuming to display them as real or imaginary representations.": "Franz",
  "I may be helping to bring harmony between people through my music.": "Nat",
  "What does that represent? There was never any question in plastic art, in poetry, in music, of representing anything. It is a matter of making something beautiful, moving, or dramatic - this is by no means the same thing.": "Fernand",
  "What's really good is African drum music.": "Fiona",
  "I write the vocals last, because I wanted to invent the music first and push the music to the level that I had to compete against it.": "Axl",
  "There's a sadness to the human condition that I think music is good for. It gives a counterpoint to the visual beauty, and adds depth to pictures that they wouldn't have if the music wasn't there.": "Mike",
  "When I was a teenager, I began to settle into school because I'd discovered the extracurricular activities that interested me: music and theater.": "Morgan",
  "The Bee Gees who are brilliant, I just love great music.": "Michael",
  "I want to run for the Senate from Tennessee. Not now, but when I'm 50, when music dies down a little bit. I know lots of artists and actors have those delusions of grandeur, but ever since I was a kid, it's been of interest to me.": "Tim",
  "I was king of the mountain for a long time, well, I don't want that no more. I like to perform every once in a while for people who want to see me, and cut albums of music that is what I'm really about.": "Waylon",
  "I think you have to keep a childlike quality to play music or make a record.": "Beck",
  "It's the first time I have returned to my roots - like going back to be a trio. The fans really wanted me to go back on stage and do the Supremes music, so I went about trying to make it happen. We'll go on tour in the summer.": "Diana",
  "Punk is not just the sound, the music. Punk is a lifestyle.": "Billie",
  "It is piracy, not overt online music stores, which is our main competitor.": "Steve",
  "Boy bands should be exploded from a great height. They're just pretty people singing music written by others.": "Eddie",
  "Music is my life, professionally, for nearly 60 years. To be recognized by the academy is still the highest honor.": "Ray",
  "Music must take rank as the highest of the fine arts - as the one which, more than any other, ministers to the human spirit.": "Herbert",
  "Those who seek to satisfy the mind of man by hampering it with ceremonies and music and affecting charity and devotion have lost their original nature.": "Zhuangzi",
  "When you play music with someone who has a heart rather than playing with someone who is just doing it for money or is cynical it makes all the difference.": "Greg",
  "Those who have virtue always in their mouths, and neglect it in practice, are like a harp, which emits a sound pleasing to others, while itself is insensible of the music.": "Diogenes",
  "Style has always been very important to us. We grew up in the '70s. Music was glam rock, punk rock and a very stylish movement.": "Nick",
  "I think one of my favorite things to do is just lock myself up in a small room and listen to music and watch films for a day. Also I just like seeing my friends. We have pizza parties which means I get four friends round, we eat a pizza and we're really lazy and we play PlayStation.": "Daniel",
  "But with rap music - not just N.W.A. - but rap music in general, seeing these artists wearing these team logos all the time started bringing a synergy and energy about having to rep your city, your team, everywhere and all the time.": "Ice",
  "Hip-hop's always reached out to kids. If you look at the last 10 big albums it might seem ironic. But when I look at the history of this music it's always had a lot of positivity.": "LL",
  "As long as your intention is pure, and you know what you're in it for, then you're alright. And I'm in it because I enjoy it. I take it seriously... real seriously. I mean I could sit and talk all day about the music.": "Trey",
  "I'm not trying to pull the rug out from under anybody, but the music really does tell you where to go.": "Trey",
  "Music comes from a place we don't know.": "Chris",
  "I was a fan of heavy music - first metal, then punk, then hip hop.": "Tom",
  "To really be tortured by a song, it needs to be more than just something you don't like or don't get; it has to make your skin crawl by getting under it. Strangely, that last clause could describe provocative or daring music, as well.": "Carrie",
  "Ironically, being a coach on 'The Voice' and spending time with those kids, Xenia and Dia especially, I learned a lot about myself. It reminded me how lucky I am that this happened for me, and it kind of lit the spark inside me again for my love of music.": "Blake",
  "I want my music to do the explaining.": "Demi",
  "I feel like music can affect you in so many ways. When you hear a song with a happy melody, it can change your mood; it can change your day.": "Kygo",
  "Music is part of us, and either ennobles or degrades our behavior.": "Boethius",
  "I dabbled in things like Howlin' Wolf, Cream and Led Zeppelin, but when I heard Son House and Robert Johnson, it blew my mind. It was something I'd been missing my whole life. That music made me discard everything else and just get down to the soul and honesty of the blues.": "Jack",
  "There is hardly any money interest in art, and music will be there when money is gone.": "Duke",
  "There is two kinds of music, the good, and the bad. I play the good kind.": "Louis",
  "I was a very interested arts student, I was always into that part of school and when I got into high school I went into architectural drafting. It gave me an understanding of how to build things and it's really helped me put things in perspective. With my music and my movies, to me it's all art.": "Ice",
  "I can easily say I've done everything I've wanted in music.": "Phil",
  "Music is what I love to do it's in my veins. ": "Demi",
  "Music is the wine which inspires one to new generative processes, and I am Bacchus who presses out this glorious wine for mankind and makes them spiritually drunken.": "Ludwig",
  "One and the same thing can at the same time be good, bad, and indifferent, e.g., music is good to the melancholy, bad to those who mourn, and neither good nor bad to the deaf.": "Baruch",
  "If architecture is frozen music then music must be liquid architecture.": "Quincy",
  "People often complain that music is too ambiguous, that what they should think when they hear it is so unclear, whereas everyone understands words. With me, it is exactly the opposite, and not only with regard to an entire speech but also with individual words.": "Felix",
  "I do know the effect that music still has on me - I'm completely vulnerable to it. I'm seduced by it.": "Debbie",
  "I found that it wasn't so oddball to like music and poetry and visual arts, they're kindred spirits.": "J.",
  "When you write, it's making a certain kind of music in your head. There's a rhythm to it, a pulse, and on the whole, I'm writing to that drum rather than the psychological process.": "Tom",
  "Music is love in search of a word.": "Sidney",
  "I've always felt music is the only way to give an instantaneous moment the feel of slow motion. To romanticise it and glorify it and give it a soundtrack and a rhythm.": "Taylor",
  "For me, a paragraph in a novel is a bit like a line in a poem. It has its own shape, its own music, its own integrity.": "Paul",
  "The best music is essentially there to provide you something to face the world with.": "Bruce",
  "Writing has laws of perspective, of light and shade just as painting does, or music. If you are born knowing them, fine. If not, learn them. Then rearrange the rules to suit yourself.": "Truman",
  "Ever since I was a kid, this was all I wanted to do. I've wanted to do music. I wanted to sing. It's all I know.": "Bruno",
  "I would like to be known as an 'artist'. Whether that be music, acting, sketching, cooking, whatever. I'm interested in all of those things.": "Mark",
  "Mozart's music is like an X-ray of your soul - it shows what is there, and what isn't.": "Isaac",
  "Faith is reason plus revelation, and the revelation part requires one to think with the spirit as well as with the mind. You have to hear the music, not just read the notes on the page.": "Francis",
  "Amazingly, I've been sort of an anomaly in the music industry. I feel like I've been able to exist as kind of a throwback artist.": "Jewel",
  "If I'm not working on music, I'm usually with my friends playing FIFA. We just kick back - I'm proper chilled.": "Stormzy",
  "I treat every album as a new beginning, so I'm asking myself, 'What is pop music now? What are people consuming?' and I take these things into effect.": "Luis",
  "No two people on earth are alike, and it's got to be that way in music or it isn't music.": "Billie",
  "I feel like good music comes and goes in waves.": "Santigold",
  "I don't live for the accolades. I'm more so about the music. Making it, and putting it out. Those are the two best feelings.": "J.",
  "There's more to life than listening to rock music.": "Frank",
  "When I was a teeny little girl, I was in dancing school, and I sang. We had to put a dance to a song, so I went to the 10-cent store one day and looked at all the sheet music. It was all laid out, and I picked 'Life Is Just a Bowl of Cherries.'": "Doris",
  "The rhetoric is the key to the character. It's the verbal music of the piece.": "Peter",
  "The aggressive side of me comes across in my music, but I'm just a sweet girl.": "Pink",
  "Music happens to be an art form that transcends language.": "Herbie",
  "I know that I'm here because of the grace of God. But I also know that I've been given this second chance for a specific reason, and that is to bring love to the world again through the voice of my music, and I'm so honored to be able to do it. I'm so blessed that God has chosen me to do that.": "El",
  "You have to be careful not to make music something you don't want to do. Which happens. I've gotten off the road and been like, 'I hate it. I hate singing, I hate playing guitar.' Six days later, I'm in my bedroom singing at the top of my lungs because I love it so much.": "Shawn",
  "With the White Stripes we were trying to trick people into not realising we were playing the blues. We did not want to come off like white kids trying to play black music from 100 years ago so a great way to distract them was by dressing in red, white and black.": "Jack",
  "My debut album, 'Forget the World,' is all about not listening to the negativity around you and to continue to do what you love, no matter what people think. I love what I do. Dance music is my passion, my life. There is no greater feeling than being one with my fans, partying to the music we love.": "Afrojack",
  "I haven't traveled in Africa nearly as much as I'd like to. I've been there a few times, and I'd like to learn more about the various cultures in Africa. But that's the basis point of where all of the music that I love is based upon, from Africa to Cuba to Puerto Rico to South America.": "Chick",
  "There are many singers who have got an exceptional talent, but spend their lives singing in local trains or hotels. Does the country even know who they are? Music in India is restricted only to Bollywood. Whoever manages to make a mark there is remembered. The ones who fail to reach and make it big there are forgotten.": "Sonu",
  "Music is something that should speak for itself, straight from the heart. It took me a long time to understand that.": "Damon",
  "All music is folk music. I ain't never heard a horse sing a song.": "Louis",
  "I had spent many years pursuing excellence, because that is what classical music is all about... Now it was dedicated to freedom, and that was far more important.": "Nina",
  "I don't want to be the cliche American Idol dude. I want to be different, you know - that's the whole goal, me and music. It's about being yourself and being unique.": "Paul",
  "I discovered after going to music festivals that I am a rock fan. I love the guitars, the phrasing, and the abandon of rock fans.": "Beyonce",
  "Obviously, the cinematography of films is art, just as a still shot can be art. If I'm watching a Wes Anderson movie, the colour palettes alone, and the way they're painted, could be art. With music, you're a little bit limited, of course, because it's only audio.": "Frank",
  "Pop music, disco music, and heavy metal music is about shutting out the tensions of life, putting it away.": "Peter",
  "To me, the greatest pleasure of writing is not what it's about, but the inner music that words make.": "Truman",
  "I went to see 'Phantom of the Opera' with my grandma and my mom when I was very little. The stage, the voice, the music... Composer Andrew Lloyd Webber has been a massive inspiration to me for some time - the storytelling, that deliciously somber undertone in his music.": "Lady",
  "I love to have a bath with beautiful, relaxing music on and have no rush to do anything. It's a wonderful indulgence, and it helps me to calm down and stop my mind running overtime.": "Kylie",
  "'Cat?' 'Cat' can be anybody from the guy in the gutter to a lawyer, doctor, the biggest man to the lowest man, but if he's in there with a good heart and enjoy the same music together, he's a cat.": "Louis",
  "I have three siblings. My sister makes music. My older brother is a classical conductor, and my younger brother is a mixing engineer.": "Lisa",
  "Any real record person knows that the number one most powerful marketing tool when it comes to music is repetition.": "Nile",
  "I love to read. I love to stretch. In the morning, I get up, and if I'm not in a hurry, I will lie on the floor on a rug, look through some books and magazines, and maybe listen to music and try to do stretching exercises to tune up.": "Jackson",
  "Country music is the people's music. It just speaks about real life and about truth and it tells things how they really are.": "Faith",
  "If I hadn't had music in my life, it's quite possible I'd be dead and I'd much rather be alive.": "James",
  "But I've been freestyling and messing around with rhyming since I was 13. That's when I really started listening to hip-hop music.": "John",
  "A great song is a great song, whether it's on vinyl or CD or cassette or reel to reel or mp3. Then again, that might be an overly optimistic view, but I do think that great music will transcend the medium in which it is delivered.": "Moby",
  "Music is a thing that changes people's lives. It has the capacity to make young people's lives better.": "Noel",
  "I'm free from holding personal anger because I can express what I want through my music.": "Yoko",
  "Going to college and studying music is not a bad idea at all. I don't know if you can go to college and be taught heart.": "Blake",
  "I love singing jazz. I don't like the idea that classical music should be over here and jazz should be someplace else. It's all wonderful, and we should be open to enjoying it all.": "Jessye",
  "Is Wagner a human being at all? Is he not rather a disease? He contaminates everything he touches - he has made music sick.": "Friedrich",
  "Only in country music can you compare an old pickup truck and an old guitar to your wife and turn it into a love song... Thank God for country music.": "Dierks",
  "There are times pop music is the end result when I'm in the studio, but I don't really go in and say, 'Today I am going to make a pop song,' but it can happen.": "Post",
  "I could compare my music to white light which contains all colours. Only a prism can divide the colours and make them appear this prism could be the spirit of the listener. ": "Arvo",
  "The best, most beautiful, and most perfect way that we have of expressing a sweet concord of mind to each other is by music.": "Jonathan",
  "Music is what I breathe, what I love to do. It keeps me alive.": "Miley",
  "It's all about music, because music is basically what's... been my avenue out of maybe being involved in things I shouldn't be.": "Pitbull",
  "I see music as one language. If one musical form eats its own tail, it dies. So it needs to be a mongrel, it needs to be hybridised.": "Sting",
  "Same with anyone who's been flying for years and loves it still... we're part of a world we deeply love. Just as musicians feel about scores and melodies, dancers about the steps and flow of music, so we're one with the principle of flight, the magic of being aloft in the wind!": "Richard",
  "I became inspired while I was listening to music on the radio. I felt the music in my head sounded better, so I turned off the radio and scribbled it down on a piece of paper. I remember that it was in May. People liked that song. They said it was beautiful. I felt overjoyed.": "Bhumibol",
  "The truest expression of a people is in its dances and its music. Bodies never lie.": "Agnes",
  "Music, Rock and Roll music especially, is such a generational thing. Each generation must have their own music, I had my own in my generation, you have yours, everyone I know has their own generation.": "Ronnie",
  "Music at times is more like perfume than mathematics.": "Gabriel",
  "He has Van Gogh's ear for music.": "Billy",
  "Everywhere in the world, music enhances a hall, with one exception: Carnegie Hall enhances the music.": "Isaac",
  "I love being in public places, but I can't stand long, drawn-out music festivals.": "Lamorne",
  "I don't feel guilty about the music I love. If you feel guilty about something you dig, then you should stop feeling guilty about it. One of my favorite albums to this day is the 10th anniversary ensemble cast of 'Les Miserables,' the ultimate cast recording, and it is still something I love listening to top to bottom.": "Corey",
  "I like music that's more offensive. I like it to sound like nails on a blackboard, get me wild.": "Iggy",
  "The music industry can make you feel like a prostitute.": "Jonathan",
  "Well, we like to let down our hair and pep it up at the dances, but we keep it slower when we broadcast. We have to please everybody, and that softer music appeals to the larger amount of people. It's like eating too much cake. You have to have your steak too.": "Vaughn",
  "My music, I feel, has always been experimental, but it had got to a point where I felt disconnected from it completely. I didn't want to be a Clark Kent/Superman: I couldn't really say, 'Well, B.o.B's the old me, and Bobby Ray's the new me.' I had to just make a point.": "B.o.B",
  "You know, I do music. If you look under the hood of the industry I'm in, it's all based on technology. From radio to phonographs to CDs, it's all technology. Microphones, reel-to-reels, cameras, editing, chips, it's all technology.": "will.i.am",
  "When I hear music that parents hate, or older musicians hate, I know that's the new music. When I hear older people saying, 'I hate Rap or Techno' I rush to it.": "George",
  "I want to be ripped apart by music. I want it to be something that feeds and replenishes, or that totally sucks the life out of you. I want to be dashed against the rocks.": "Jeff",
  "I do so much music that it's like a fog, and I can't even remember all of it.": "Yelawolf",
  "I began observing, making paintings of my surroundings, taking a vow of silence, listening, composing music, writing, and making time for formal education. Then I started telling stories.": "John",
  "Sonnymoon and Quadrants are a couple of bands that really inspire me in terms of the melodics of things and certain tones and just what feels good. It takes me back to the type of music that I grew up on in my household. We played a lot of gangsta rap, but we also played a lot of oldies, and I think that mix is part of what inspires my sound.": "Kendrick",
  "I made numerous attempts to find a way to do it all, to be a creative singer, songwriter, producer, and to be the mother, daughter, sister, lover, wife. And the thing about music is, with me, that she's a harsh mistress. She does not come to me in the midst of stress.": "Anita",
  "I find that music makes people just sit and listen, firstly. Then, they seem to interpret their own emotions with the music and it makes them ponder their own life a lot. And then they start to question: Am I happy in my work? Am I happy in my relationships? What am I striving for?": "Enya",
  "The 'Carousel' overture has always been one of my all-time favorite pieces of music.": "Kelli",
  "I would like to see more African-American singers as part of our opera companies. If you take music and the arts out of the public schools, then you're going to lose a lot of people that you might have discovered were talented, very early.": "Jessye",
  "I love to act and put on a show, but you're playing a character all the time. For music, it's really just me being myself.": "Tinashe",
  "The language of film is further and further away from the language of theater and is closer to music. It's abstract but still narrative.": "Emmanuel",
  "The world of classical music is so fascinating. It's a world that encompasses people from everywhere and erases the basic restraints of nationality everyone is united by this common language of music. ": "Gael",
  "I didn't know that there were many rules in music when I first started writing.": "Tyler",
  "If you took away all pain, if everyone lived forever, everything would be bland, flat and boring; there would be no reason for art, music, newspapers, love because we would all be in a mono state of happiness.": "Matt",
  "The way you pronounce words the Puerto Rico way, it's not really global for music. Colombians speak some of the best Spanish in the world. So having a Colombian next to me every time I write makes my music more international.": "Nicky",
  "Getting to make the music, and having a good time doing it, is the most important thing to us.": "Isaac",
  "It is so characteristic, that just when the mechanics of reproduction are so vastly improved, there are fewer and fewer people who know how the music should be played.": "Ludwig",
  "The principle of the endless melody is the perpetual becoming of a music that never had any reason for starting, any more than it has any reason for ending.": "Igor",
  "I'm not trying to overcome my father or fill his shoes or reach any kind of level that he did. We're talking about a Mozart of rock music.": "Sean",
  "But however measurable, there is much more life in music than mathematics or logic ever dreamed of.": "Gabriel",
  "No one had ever told me that whites were supposed to sing one kind of music and blacks another - I sang what I liked in the only voice I had.": "Charley",
  "The reflection of the world is blues, that's where that part of the music is at. Then you got this other kind of music that's tryin' to come around.": "Jimi",
  "The movie that's had the most effect on me is Jaws. To this day when I'm in the ocean, I'm hearing that music.": "Judd",
  "The only thing that I miss lately in all music is somebody that will put out a melody that you can whistle. It doesn't seem like there's anything happening like that.": "Merle",
  "I painted the picture, and in the colors the rhythm of the music quivers. I painted the colors I saw.": "Edvard",
  "I want to make music that will make the blood surge in your veins, music that will get people up and dance.": "Alex",
  "I was influenced when I was younger by the cartoon movies that Disney put out, like Cinderella and what not. I watched those movies over and over when I was younger and the music is ingrained into my head. Nowadays, I'm still humming the tunes. It taught me the fundamentals.": "Zac",
  "People always accuse me of being motivational in a way, like it was a bad thing, but that's just how I was raised. My mom raised me in a positive environment, with lots of love in my heart, and that reflects in my music.": "Lenny",
  "I'm really an inner spirit that only makes itself known through the music. A lot of people think I'm an introvert, or quiet and moody. I've even heard some people say that there's a certain mystery or darkness about me. I'm not that way. I'm just really into what I do.": "Faith",
  "Trance is a very emotional and uplifting form of dance music. It appeals to many people in this way having such a strong connection with emotions. It makes people happy and ready to party.": "Tiesto",
  "A name doesn't make the music. It's just called that to differentiate it from other types of music.": "Art",
  "Until I realized that rock music was my connection to the rest of the human race, I felt like I was dying, for some reason, and I didn't know why.": "Bruce",
  "DJs are in incredible competition, musically. And they are the most musically creative and sensitive people in all the music charts. I am amazed how they are.": "Yoko",
  "Music is a whole oasis in my head. The creation process is so personal and fulfilling.": "River",
  "Music is the tool to express life - and all that makes a difference.": "Herbie",
  "I do listen to other music though, and try to pick up what is good.": "Nusrat",
  "But in the next world I shan't be doing music, with all the striving and disappointments. I shall be being it.": "Ralph",
  "No good opera plot can be sensible, for people do not sing when they are feeling sensible.": "W.",
  "You know, all my songs are relatives, brothers, sisters, cousins.": "David",
  "R&B is the one thing that has influenced every kind of music. Every artist that there is, from those that are sung the most to Adele - you know, she was so influenced by so many R&B artists and soul music - it's clear in her writing that that's where it comes from.": "Babyface",
  "Love cannot express the idea of music, while music may give an idea of love.": "Hector",
  "For me, the backdrop of half the experiences of life includes music.": "Amy",
  "Half the battle is selling music, not singing it. It's the image, not what you sing.": "Rod",
  "But recently I began to feel that maybe I wouldn't be able to do what I want to do and need to do with American musicians, who are imprisoned behind these bars; music's got these bars and measures you know.": "Sun",
  "The music industry is saying, This is the format, and if you'll fit into this format, you can be on radio, and if radio will play you, MTV will expose you, and MTV will expose you, we'll sell records.": "Nikki",
  "I hate most of what constitutes rock music, which is basically middle-aged crap.": "Sting",
  "Most people wouldn't know music if it came up and bit them on the ass.": "Frank",
  "What is this? It's music to get a brain seizure by.": "Ozzy",
  "There are certain things in which mediocrity is not to be endured, such as poetry, music, painting, public speaking.": "Jean",
  "Music, as many people have said, is the universal language. Of course points are made which make you think about things, but ultimately it makes you feel. And that's why people remember more songs that have meant something during their life than films. They start to define periods in your life, and that's kind of the beauty of it.": "Scott",
  "My whole thing is not just to play music for people, but to make them part of the evening.": "Marvin",
  "Before breaking into music, I had various jobs: forklift driver, driving a courier. But I was forced into working rather than doing it off my own bat because that was my dad's way: you got a job and paid your way.": "Gary",
  "I start really missing London when I go away. I have a little flat, but very central. I live above a pub and you'd think it'd be a nightmare, but I like hearing the music and it's quite comforting.": "Ellie",
  "Now is now, and I live everything one day at a time. The fact that I'm still on the planet and able to still make music is such a miracle.": "Ronnie",
  "If you invent something, you're doing a creative act. It's like writing a novel or composing music. You put your heart and soul into it, and money. It's years of your life, it's your house remortgaged, huge emotional investment and financial investment.": "James",
  "I'm not necessarily that big of a clubbing junkie, but I really like dance music as a genre.": "Mika",
  "I don't need an award to inspire me to keep making music.": "Jake",
  "I find a therapy in playing music, in many different ways.": "Dave",
  "We're all just animals. That's all we are, and everything else is just an elaborate justification of our instincts. That's where music comes from. And romantic poetry. And bad novels.": "Elvis",
  "The music industry is dominated by guys. I work with men 98 percent of the time - producers, arrangers, musicians, engineers.": "Shakira",
  "Everyone one-on-one will be completely honest about the music that they listen to. But then you get into a group situation, and then it's the cool/uncool debate. I have really done my very best to reinforce the very fact that your heart knows better than your head does what you like when it comes to music and what not.": "Corey",
  "I always tell the fans, 'Screw it! Like what you like. Listen to what you want.' Insisting that one type of music is better than the next is snobbery, and I have no time for that. Check out all the music that's out there. There's great stuff you're probably missing.": "Corey",
  "In country music, one of the ways we may have gone wrong in the past is trying to be politically correct all the time.": "Blake",
  "As humans, we have the tendency to call on God only when we think that we're in dire straits as opposed to cultivating a real relationship with Him every day. And that's what my music tries to convey to all the listeners - try to cultivate it every day.": "Yolanda",
  "If you believe in what you do and you really want to be in music, just stick at it. It's always a learning process. Enjoy it because I think making music is a privilege, really. In an ideal world, it should also always be fun. As much as possible, make it fun.": "Kate",
  "Life seems terrible and disappointing, so you need to find something you need to make you stick around. Music that makes me happiest is the saddest music, with the most emotional feel.": "Josh",
  "It's hard to dance to really fast music. All you can do is pump your fist to it, and after a while, you're going to have a seizure.": "Kiesza",
  "My mother was American, and my father was from the Caribbean, and there was a big open door into the world of humanity and music.": "Taj",
  "Making music is an emotional thing. And when you're on a video shoot with 50 people there, you have to somehow, in a non-emotional way, say what you want and not feel guilty for it. And that takes growing up and that takes... not caring how people perceive you as much. And it just takes experience, I think.": "Jillian",
  "From the first album, Led Zeppelin was always going to be a totally new approach from what had gone before - whether it was approaching the blues or folk music like 'Babe I'm Gonna Leave You': nothing existed like that.": "Jimmy",
  "When I began making electronic music, the only thing I was thinking about was creating music that I really liked. I didn't think about what effect it would have; I was busy doing it.": "Jean-Michel",
  "I love a lot of different styles, but my heart belongs in electronic music.": "John",
  "I can't create music if I'm wearing a mask and not being myself, and that was the problem with The Czars.": "John",
  "A song without music is a lot like H2 without the O.": "Ira",
  "Music and silence combine strongly because music is done with silence, and silence is full of music.": "Marcel",
  "For the introduction of a new kind of music must be shunned as imperiling the whole state since styles of music are never disturbed without affecting the most important political institutions. ": "Plato",
  "The music industry is a strange combination of having real and intangible assets: pop bands are brand names in themselves, and at a given stage in their careers their name alone can practically gaurantee hit records.": "Richard",
  "There's no religion but sex and music.": "Sting",
  "Music makes me high on stage, and that's the truth. It's like being almost addicted to music.": "Jimi",
  "I see architecture not as Gropius did, as a moral venture, as truth, but as invention, in the same way that poetry or music or painting is invention.": "Michael",
  "I love music passionately. And because I love it I try to free it from barren traditions that stifle it.": "Claude",
  "I firmly disbelieve that one has to be a tortured soul to write good music.": "P.",
  "It's nice to be able to backtrack and not be embarrassed by the music you used to listen to.": "Will",
  "I'm saddened to see that everyone's pitched out the baby with the bath, in that we say that it can't be one or the other, it could be both. I mean, just because we listen to classical music doesn't mean that we can't listen to jazz.": "Don",
  "Change is always happening. That's one of the wonderful things about jazz music.": "Maynard",
  "The tango is really a combination of many cultures, though it eventually became the national music of Argentina.": "Yo-Yo",
  "Playing sport was somewhat frivolous, but I liked it. I rebelled a little bit, and wouldn't go to music lessons and things like that, but I would go and play ball. My parents learned to love it because they saw how much I got out of it.": "Mike",
  "We do play to our audience. It's very important. You can't create music in a vacuum.": "Brian",
  "The beautiful thing about hip-hop is it's like an audio collage. You can take any form of music and do it in a hip-hop way and it'll be a hip-hop song. That's the only music you can do that with.": "Talib",
  "One of the interesting things here is that the people who should be shaping the future are politicians. But the political framework itself is so dead and closed that people look to other sources, like artists, because art and music allow people a certain freedom.": "Thom",
  "I don't like to talk about things where you're going to gt one side or the other unhappy. My music has no politics.": "Loretta",
  "I do promotion when it is necessary, but I always want to get back to the music.": "Enya",
  "If you pour some music on whatever's wrong, it'll sure help out.": "Levon",
  "Music - that's been my education. There's not a day that goes by that I take it for granted.": "Billie",
  "I like music because it's the only invisible art form.": "Sean",
  "People think our music's very aggressive or angry or whatever, and it's just the opposite, really... I like laughing. And I like being really calm before a show, and smiley.": "Serj",
  "If the pressure is getting to you, whistle. In a barely audible way. It's the best way I know of to let go of tension. Music gets your mind off the situation, and the act of whistling melts the tension out of your body.": "Fuzzy",
  "It was amazing and inspiring to see so many people come together through music to aid the great state of Vermont.": "Trey",
  "There are a lot of influences from different countries in my music. For example, I chose the guitar in my music, I think that it is a feminine instrument, so when I do not sing, the music expresses my voice.": "Paulina",
  "As a woman, you spend so much time either cooking or getting ready to go somewhere. I like to have music when I'm doing either of these things.": "Zoe",
  "I believe that music is another form of news. Music is another form of journalism to me so I have to cover all the areas with my album.": "Lil",
  "Many people die with their music still in them. Why is this so? Too often it is because they are always getting ready to live. Before they know it, time runs out.": "Oliver",
  "Develop interest in life as you see it; in people, things, literature, music - the world is so rich, simply throbbing with rich treasures, beautiful souls and interesting people. Forget yourself.": "Henry",
  "Medicine to produce health must examine disease; and music, to create harmony must investigate discord.": "Plutarch",
  "A lot of pop music is about stealing pocket money from children.": "Ian",
  "I was about sixteen when I discovered that music could get you laid, so I got into music boy, didn't matter what you looked like either, you could be a geeky looking guy but if you played music, whoa, you'd get the girls.": "Tommy",
  "As Erykah Badu, it has nothing to do with me, the way I look, my hair wrap, my style, it's about you and what you feel for my music. If I can make you feel like the way that people who influenced me made me feel, that's completion.": "Erykah",
  "I mean, just because you're a musician doesn't mean all your ideas are about music. So every once in a while I get an idea about plumbing, I get an idea about city government, and they come the way they come.": "Jerry",
  "Music is always a commentary on society.": "Frank",
  "I believe music should reflect yourself in some way and not just yourself at the given time. I feel that when you die or when you're going, someone's supposed to listen to that music and know everything about you. And I just try to get that across.": "Lil",
  "I love electronic music, and I love drum and bass.": "Fred",
  "In its beginnings, music was merely chamber music, meant to be listened to in a small space by a small audience.": "Gustav",

  "Music is the soundtrack of your life.": "Dick",
  "Every song is like a painting.": "Dick",
  "The advice I am giving always to all my students is above all to study the music profoundly... music is like the ocean, and the instruments are little or bigger islands, very beautiful for the flowers and trees.": "Andres",
  "I need music. It's like my heartbeat, so to speak. It keeps me going no matter what's going on - bad games, press, whatever!": "LeBron",
  "The tuba is certainly the most intestinal of instruments, the very lower bowel of music.": "Peter",
  "I alone of English writers have consciously set myself to make music out of what I may call the sound of sense.": "Robert",
  "My loathings are simple: stupidity, oppression, crime, cruelty, soft music.": "Vladimir",
  "When a singer truly feels and experiences what the music is all about, the words will automatically ring true.": "Montserrat",
  "There are so many opportunities in life, that the loss of two or three capabilities is not necessarily debilitating. A handicap can give you the opportunity to focus more on art, writing, or music.": "Jim",
  "To be alive, to be able to see, to walk, to have houses, music, paintings - it's all a miracle. I have adopted the technique of living life miracle to miracle.": "Arthur",
  "A verbal art like poetry is reflective; it stops to think. Music is immediate, it goes on to become.": "W.",
  "To know how to suggest is the great art of teaching. To attain it we must be able to guess what will interest; we must learn to read the childish soul as we might a piece of music. Then, by simply changing the key, we keep up the attraction and vary the song.": "Henri",

  "Country music is three chords and the truth.": "Harlan",

  "When they look back on me I want 'em to remember me not for all my wives, although I've had a few, and certainly not for any mansions or high livin' money I made and spent. I want 'em to remember me simply for my music.": "Jerry",
  "There was one man who was interested in the color of music, the connection between light and music, and that was Einstein.": "Leon",
  "In serial music, the series itself is seldom audible... What I'm interested in is a compositional process and a sounding music that are one in the same thing.": "Steve",
  "I discovered that the most interesting music of all was made by simply lining the loops in unison, and letting them slowly shift out of phase with other.": "Steve",
  "Rock n' Roll came from the slaves singing gospel in the fields. Their lives were hell and they used music to lift out of it, to take them away. That's what rock n' roll should do - take you to a better place.": "Meat",
  "My dad wanted me to play when I was a kid, so I learned to play the guitar. I pursued a career in music because I love it so much and I enjoy what it does to those who hear it.": "Randy",
  "I cannot conceive of music that expresses absolutely nothing.": "Bela",
  "I was never worried that synthesizers would replace musicians. First of all, you have to be a musician in order to make music with a synthesizer.": "Robert",
  "Good rock music always tends to be around.": "Dave",
  "My free time at home is usually spent emailing, listening to music, reading and talking on the phone. I wish I was on the phone less, but I have been fortunate to stay in touch with so many incredible friends.": "Steve",

  "Music is the expression of the movement of the waters, the play of curves described by changing breezes.": "Claude",
  "It's about the music and that's it. I'm not an entertainer. But I do entertain people, see what I mean?": "Liam",
  "Music is one of those things that is constantly going in my head all the time. It's sort of like the evolution and creation of doing food, or my philosophy about wine. It's always beating in my head, so it keeps the spirit moving.": "Emeril",
  "Yes, there are times when I get extremely depressed and how I sublimate those feelings is through music.": "Peter",
  "Unfortunately, the young generation, who I believe have their own place in the sun like I had mine; but I wish it was possible there were other ways to have them understand this music was here before they came, and the reason that it was here.": "Ruth",
  "I have been tied up with music for about as long as I can remember. By the time I was four I was picking out little tunes my mother played on the reed organ in the living-room.": "Mary",
  "If you already have a piece of music ingrained in your body, why would you not play it?": "Keith",
  "I can write music but I'm not much for words.": "Jim",
  "I am musical and I enjoy theatre, but I never wanted to just do theatre. I always wanted to go into film. I love film. I loved growing up in the theatre, but I always wanted to do film all along. But, I still pursue music separately.": "Sabrina",

  "They told me that they are starting a classic label, and wanted me to be the first artist. So I signed, and am producing myself, and writing my own music, but I'm their first artist on their classic label. And I have creative control.": "Teena",
  "When I was younger, I was in love with everything about the British Isles, from British folklore to Celtic music. That was always where my passions were as a young girl, and so I studied folklore as a college student in England and Ireland.": "Terri",
  "We just make music. For I never stop working.": "Dennis",
  "Instrumental music can spread the international language.": "Herb",
  "Music has always been transnational; people pick up whatever interests them, and certainly a lot of classical music has absorbed influences from all over the world.": "Yo-Yo",
  "The real reason we ended up getting into that type of music was our dad worked for an oil company so we spent a year overseas when we were young kids. Because of that, it was all Spanish TV and radio so we ended up having these '50s and '60s tapes, tapes of that music.": "Zac",
  "Like Jermaine was saying, it's a beautiful day, and we're just glad all of this is behind us. We can go on with our lives. And Michael can go on with his life and do what he does best, and that's making good music, making his fans happy, people happy all over the world.": "Tito",

  "My opinion is that music is music. As long as you approach doing a remix with truth, I don't see the dance remixes being any different than an hip-hop remix- it's really a different version of the song.": "Deborah",

  "If a professional musician in a symphony orchestra is playing Beethoven. But this particular orchestra have played this particular chestnut so many times, they can play it in their sleep. Does the genius remain present in the music or not?": "Robert",

  "My head works in music, so there's always music there.": "Ben",
  "So, when you divide the world into music lovers, music fans and then those people who are just very casual about their music, it's wallpaper to them, it's elevator music, it's just the thing that's playing in the background that helps them through their day.": "Michael",
  "Beyond a certain point, the music isn't mine anymore. It's yours.": "Phil",

  "Don't make music for some vast, unseen audience or market or ratings share or even for something as tangible as money. Though it's crucial to make a living, that shouldn't be your inspiration. Do it for yourself.": "Billy",
  "I grew up listening to a lot of soul music, and a lot of folk music.": "Katey",

  "I'm quite into listening to music and not doing anything else.": "Jonny",
  "There is a lot of work just in terms of traveling and logistics and people and gear and all that kind of stuff. But I never really have problems playing music. That never seems like work.": "James",
  "Well, because music is my life and music is not work for me.": "Gunther",
  "I'm a big collector of vinyl - I have a record room in my house - and I've always had a huge soundtrack album collection. So what I do, as I'm writing a movie, is go through all those songs, trying to find good songs for fights, or good pieces of music to layer into the film.": "Quentin",
  "No, I do a bunch of things to entertain myself. I paint, I make music, I take photographs.": "Charlie",
  "The only things Mick and I disagree about is the band, the music and what we do.": "Keith",
  "Drums just always sounded like the most fun part of that good music for me.": "Levon",
  "My dad took me to all the best rock and punk shows when I was growing up and music has always been a part of my life. So I'm very interested in the music scene and I suppose that's why I've ended up going out with musicians. Dave Pirner is still one of my best friends.": "Winona",
  "I think that is what film and art and music do they can work as a map of sorts for your feelings. ": "Bruce",
  "I'm one of those firm believers that good music will prevail.": "Pras",
  "I do like what Alicia Keys and John Legend are doing. With their music, you keep your clothes on.": "Ben",
  "I wasn't interested in writing music that wasn't beautiful for me to listen to.": "Joanna",
  "Black music has increased my enjoyment of what I do. It has increased my range, my ability to reach into myself and accept myself.": "Michael",
  "For a person as obsessed with music as I am, I always hear a song in the back of my head, all the time, and that usually is my own tune. I've done that all my life.": "Bjork",
  "Music is harmony, harmony is perfection, perfection is our dream, and our dream is heaven.": "Henri",
  "Rock and roll music - the music of freedom frightens people and unleashes all manner of conservative defense mechanisms.": "Salman",
  "When music fails to agree to the ear, to soothe the ear and the heart and the senses, then it has missed the point.": "Maria",
  "Conductors' careers are made for the most part with 'Romantic' music. 'Classic' music eliminates the conductor we do not remember him in it. ": "Igor",
  "Music creates order out of chaos: for rhythm imposes unanimity upon the divergent, melody imposes continuity upon the disjointed, and harmony imposes compatibility upon the incongruous.": "Yehudi",
  "Music exists for the purpose of growing an admirable heart.": "Shinichi",
  "Napster hijacked our music without asking. They never sought our permission. Our catalog of music simply became available as free downloads on the Napster system.": "Lars",
  "When we made that album with Gary Moore, I was still kind of searching for the right direction for myself. Although the music is quite good the direction was like a box of fireworks that caught light all at the same time.": "Greg",
  "Dance with a girl three times, and if you like the light of her eye and the tone of voice with which she, breathless, answers your little questions about horseflesh and music about affairs masculine and feminine, then take the leap in the dark.": "Anthony",
  "It's about giving the people what they want. So many people have told me that they've made love to my records so what I've delivered this time is an album about sex. Pretty much every song has that theme. Straight no chasers, it's booty music!": "Tyrese",
  "I'd love to do my own music for sure. I'd love to have a band.": "Selena",
  "Music is in my DNA!": "Rihanna",
  "I like having my hair and face done, but I'm not going to lose weight because someone tells me to. I make music to be a musician not to be on the cover of Playboy.": "Adele",
  "I really started writing music to challenge myself, to see what I could write.": "Amy",
  "Thirty-three-years-old, still creating art. It's rage, it's creativity, it's pain, it's hurt, but it's the opportunity to still have my voice get out there through music.": "Kanye",
  "I feel like I was the only person who was capable of making this type of music in this type of way. I don't rap like nobody, I don't try to sound like nobody.": "Mos",
  "I just want to sing, I want to work on my music, I want to make my movies, that's all I want to do.": "Marc",
  "That type of autograph, pictures and apparel thievery was not part of what I grew up with. I loved the artists and their music. I would be thrilled to meet them, but the thought of getting a scribble or stealing an article of clothing never occurred or appealed to me.": "Davey",
  "I am into nature and seeing whales. I went whale-watching, and I was really looking forward to that, but when you see it on TV and you see other programs do it, you're seeing close-ups of these massive creatures, and the music that's added gives you a certain feeling.": "Karl",
  "My first real foreign holiday was my honeymoon 20 years ago, and we went to Bali. It was particularly special for that reason, I enjoyed it very much - I had packed music scores and a practice drum pad, suspecting that I would be completely bored, but actually they remained in my case.": "Evelyn",
  "I became a set designer for opera. I'm a great opera buff, I love classical music, and I needed a time-out.": "Maurice",
  "You know, for most of its life bluegrass has had this stigma of being all straw hats and hay bales and not necessarily the most sophisticated form of music. Yet you can't help responding to its honesty. It's music that finds its way deep into your soul because it's strings vibrating against wood and nothing else.": "Alison",
  "The fact that we elected Obama was a sign that the black struggle inherent in the blues and so much of the music I have loved can triumph.": "Jack",
  "I read a lot; fiction and non-fiction are the mediums I find most edifying and inspiring. I watch movies and listen to music and take lots and lots of walks. Nature is a nice reset button for me, it's how I get a lot of thinking done.": "Carrie",
  "My aim is just to make good music every single time.": "Lil",
  "Music is my hustle.": "Pitbull",
  "When I got into music, I wanted to learn guitar just enough to be able to write songs. I wanted to be able to express myself.": "Chris",
  "Our job as producers is to make the music sound as good as possible.": "David",
  "Nobody was listening when I learned how to play music. But there's something about being on stage, talking to the audience, looking at them and smiling, that's always been difficult for me. I'm a lot more comfortable now, but there are still moments of awkwardness.": "Norah",
  "I had to resign myself, many years ago, that I'm not too articulate when it comes to explaining how I feel about things. But my music does it for me, it really does.": "David",
  "This music is forever for me. It's the stage thing, that rush moment that you live for. It never lasts, but that's what you live for.": "Bruce",
  "Music should be your escape.": "Missy",
  "I've programmed myself musically to come up with love-feeling tracks that are romantic, sexy, but classy, all in one. And that's the challenge. Once I create that music, then the lyrical content starts to come - you know, the stories and things like that.": "R.",
  "I didn't want to go out and change anything. I just wanted to make the music that was part of my background, which was rock and blues and hip-hop.": "Kid",
  "We were raised in an Italian-American household, although we didn't speak Italian in the house. We were very proud of being Italian, and had Italian music, ate Italian food.": "Francis",
  "What is music. A passion for colonies not a love of country.": "Gertrude",
  "To have someone to relate to and hopefully enjoy the music and get a positive message out of it, to make the best music that we possibly could, those were the goals.": "Janet",
  "I don't know anything about music. In my line you don't have to.": "Elvis",
  "I love all music. Right now I am loving Josh Grobin and Kelly Clarkson.": "Kaley",
  "It's true, there's a lot of melancholy in my music. I don't know why, I'm not a melancholy person. I've always been drawn to it. Ever since I was a kid, if I had an album I would play the ballads on repeat.": "Norah",
  "Music is the best means we have of digesting time.": "W.",
  "If anyone can figure out how to balance my celebrity and my dual careers in music and film, it's me. I don't feel frightened; I feel challenged.": "Jennifer",
  "Mathematics is, as it were, a sensuous logic, and relates to philosophy as do the arts, music, and plastic art to poetry.": "Karl",
  "I think often sadness is a great place to get songs from.": "Sarah",
  "I got obsessed with classical music, I got obsessed with Chopin, with playing the piano.": "Gary",
  "Basically, I started singing when I started talking. Music has just been my saving grace my whole life.": "Mariah",
  "I believe 100 percent in the power and importance of music.": "James",
  "The calm mind allows one to connect with the inner self, the Soul, the very source of our being. That's where the music lives. That's where my music comes from.": "Clarence",
  "I'm not giving up my history and what I've done in my music because I love it and I'm very proud of it. I just want to open it up for more people.": "LL",
  "Hopefully my music is medicine, some type of antidote for something or some kind of explanation or just to feel good.": "Erykah",
  "One of the hardest things about writing lyrics is to make the lyrics sit on the music in such a way that you're not aware there was a writer there.": "Stephen",
  "It was stumbling on to really the bible of the blues, you know, and a very powerful drug to be introduced to us and I absorbed it totally, and it changed my complete outlook on music.": "Eric",
  "I've always loved music, but I never really played anything. After 'Walk the Line' and learning to play guitar, and having that sense of performing, I think that certainly opened the door for me, for music.": "Joaquin",
  "I think all music is a gift from God.": "Pharrell",
  "I love making music, though. I love playing.": "Pharrell",
  "Classical music is the kind we keep thinking will turn into a tune.": "Kin",
  "There are better ways we can transform this virulent hatred - by living our ideals, the Peace Corps, exchange students, teachers, exporting our music, poetry, blue jeans.": "Helen",
  "Please write music like Wagner, only louder.": "Samuel",
  "This music won't do. There's not enough sarcasm in it.": "Samuel",
  "I listen to music for emotion and I get zero emotion from rap.": "Sebastian",
  "I love hip hop music, I make hip hop music.": "Charlie",
  "Do I think all contemporary Christian music is good? No.": "Amy",
  "I'd rather let the music speak for itself.": "Serj",
  "Who hears music feels his solitude peopled at once.": "Robert",
  "The problem for me, still today, is that I write purely with one dramatic structure and that is the rite of passage. I'm not really skilled in any other. Rock and roll itself can be described as music to accompany the rite of passage.": "Pete",
  "I have terrible hearing trouble. I have unwittingly helped to invent and refine a type of music that makes its principal proponents deaf.": "Pete",
  "You can't stay the same. If you're a musician and a singer, you have to change, that's the way it works.": "Van",
  "I don't feel comfortable doing interviews. My profession is music, and writing songs. That's what I do. I like to do it, but I hate to talk about it.": "Van",
  "The '60s was one of the first times the power of music was used by a generation to bind them together.": "Neil",
  "My darlings, if I can't write dark, epic music, I can't live!": "Amy",
  "I believe that music is a force in itself. It is there and it needs an outlet, a medium. In a way, we are just the medium.": "Maynard",
  "If I could believe the Quakers banned music because church music is so damn bad, I should view them with approval.": "Ezra",
  "I don't need anybody to market or promote me. If people don't want to hear this music, then it's not for them. You cannot please everybody.": "Lauryn",
  "I think it takes a lot of trickery to keep up with the media and its perception of you. I don't know if I have it in me most of the time to care. The music is made first, and the interviews or photos to keep it alive come later as a necessary evil, I suppose.": "Jack",
  "I have taken taking my music to labels for years, and everyone just thought it was creepy. They thought the images with the music were weird and verging on psychotic.": "Lana",
  "Songs used to be short, then they became longer, and now they're getting shorter. But otherwise, music is about a beat and a message. If the beat gets to the audience, and the message touches them, you've got a hit.": "Casey",
  "I don't like rap music at all. I don't think it's music. It's just a beat and rapping.": "Nina",
  "I don't know why, it's the same reason why you like some music and you don't like others. There's something about it that you like. Ultimately I don't find it's in my best interests to try and analyze it, since it's fundamentally emotional.": "Jerry",
  "I think the world is very much embracing this whole concept of musicians going out and playing their instruments and playing music for music as opposed to music that has something to do with some form of image or imagery.": "Les",
  "We all love musical architecture there's no doubt about that. ": "Levon",
  "Music really is our daily medicine.": "Evelyn",
  "Nobody will ever take Maurice's place, and he'll go on with us and he'll go on our music. He'll go on with us as the Bee Gees, and Maurice will always be with us.": "Robin",
  "The more a race is governed by its passions, the less it has acquired the habit of cautious and reasoned argument, the more intense will be its love of music.": "Stendhal",
  "The Wedding March always reminds me of the music played when soldiers go into battle.": "Heinrich",
  "The real art of conducting consists in transitions.": "Gustav",
  "I asked my daughter when she was 16, What's the buzz on the street with the kids? She's going, to be honest, Dad, most of my friends aren't into Kiss. But they've all been told that it's the greatest show on Earth.": "Ace",
  "I don't like painting flowers in my music. I like painting guts and pain.": "Jonathan",
  "Music is the fourth great material want, first food, then clothes, then shelter, then music.": "Christian",
  "I suppose, counting back, if the Beatles had been influenced by music in the same length of time ago - you'd have to put that into better English for me, thank you - they would have been like a banjo orchestra. They would have been doing show tunes.": "Jonny",
  "The whole rise of new adult contemporary music and smooth jazz was a nice surprise.": "Kenny",
  "I grew up listening to spiritual music, Blind Willie Johnson and folk.": "Ben",
  "My health is wonderful. I work out. I'm working. Playing music. I have a beautiful wife, a nice home, a nice car, I got money in the bank. I got three beautiful dogs that love me. Like I said, I'm blessed. I survived.": "Steven",
  "Music is wonderful. Especially if there's some kind of content to it.": "Debbie",
  "I don't see it in terms of changing things, but rather using language and music as weapons for fighting a mainstream media which is predominately right wing, and loyal to the political framework and its corporate interests.": "Thom",
  "It was all about music, about getting your friends to come and see you play. I don't see that same intimacy happening very much today.": "Layne",
  "I didn't think we would ever make enough money to pay rent by playing music.": "Gregg",
  "I try to make sure that the Buddhism is more or less implicit in the music rather than explicit.": "Duncan",
  "Over the years, music put a weapon in my hand and words in my mouth, it backed me up and shielded me, it shook me and scared me and showed me the way; music opened me up to living and being and feeling.": "Carrie",
  "I listen to all kinds of music - new music, old music, music of my colleagues, everything.": "Gyorgy",
  "I'm 19, I'm a girl, I'm very young, I like all sorts of different things, I like all sorts of different styles of music, I like all sorts of different styles of clothes, I like all sorts of different colors of hair.": "Joss",
  "Music is a great energizer. It's a language everybody knows.": "Bill",
  "You can never get silence anywhere nowadays, have you noticed?": "Bryan",
  "Secretly, I wanted to look like Jimi Hendrix, but I could never quite pull it off.": "Bryan",
  "But when you get music and words together, that can be a very powerful thing.": "Bryan",
  "Sometimes before we make a record I go back and listen to a few. It's equally humbling and uplifting.": "Michael",
  "I like the fact that music is more abstract.": "Bryan",
  "I was really lucky that I came to puberty at a time when music and politics were completely intertwined.": "Bob",
  "Pop changes week to week, month to month. But great music is like literature.": "Ravi",
  "My father used to sing to me in my mother's womb. I think I can name about any tune in two beats.": "Yancy",
  "What I try to impart to a musician is to really try to practice the instrument in a really sincere way. Learn as much about music as you possibly can. Learn composition. Study to try to create compositions of your own and put your own personal touch on your music.": "Roscoe",
  "I mix up all styles on my albums because that is what music is about now.": "David",
  "I played, like, a year of piano until I learned the 'Pink Panther' theme. That was my goal. Once I was good enough, I quit. Now my music has to have some rock.": "Jack",
  "It is the element I miss in electronic music - no performance, no loving immersion. Maybe that is why I was never particularly drawn to electronic music.": "Lukas",
  "I'm always going to get more of a charge playing Chicago than I will Duluth or some place like that. Just because of the history and the people there are way more knowledgeable than a lot of other cities. It's an amazing music scene with some great bands and great musicians.": "Matt",
  "The people who know nothing about music are the ones always talking about it.": "Nat",
  "We learned pretty early on in this band that you can't have snobbery in music.": "Mike",
  "What makes my approach special is that I do different things. I do jazz, blues, country music and so forth. I do them all, like a good utility man.": "Ray",
  "Learning to read music in Braille and play by ear helped me develop a damn good memory.": "Ray",
  "Music's staying power is a function of how timeless the lyrics, song and production are.": "Gary",
  "I've been writing Indian music for a while. Indian music is about Mother Earth, and mine is no exception.": "Jimmy",
  "I'm not really interested in music. Music is just a means of creating a magical state.": "Robert",
  "If an apprentice does not hear what a master hears, is then that quality not present in the music? Yes and no. In the world in which the apprentice lives no.": "Robert",
  "This band is a real collaboration, and I'm greatful to anybody who can appreciate our music. It doesn't have to be a certain kind of fan or person or anything. I think there's a little bit of something for everybody on this record.": "Krist",
  "Times were changing. Clothes were changing. Morals were changing. We went from romantic loves songs like I used to do to rock 'n roll. Now that has changed to rap. So, there's always a new generation with new music.": "Bobby",
  "The music of the Gypsies belongs in the sphere of improvisation rather than in any other, without which it would have no power to exist.": "Franz",
  "It is essential to do everything possible to attract young people to opera so they can see that it is not some antiquated art form but a repository of the most glorious music and drama that man has created.": "Bruce",
  "I wake up in the morning, I do a little stretching exercises, pick up the horn and play.": "Herb",
  "I was growing up listening to Queen. Freddie Mercury threw those incredible melodies into his songs.": "Gary",
  "When the music and the characters are flawlessly synchronized, the opera develops an emotional force that movies and plays cannot match.": "Bruce",
  "I like when guests come over early and we chop veggies and talk and play music.": "John",
  "My music is so often like a lullaby I write to myself to make sense of things I can't tie together, or things I've lost, or things I'll never have.": "Stephan",
  "I think the problem starts with the general appreciation of the music in the larger society.": "Sonny",
  "I think its so cool that you can pick up the guitar and create something that didn't exist 5 minutes ago. You can write something that no ones ever heard before. You have music at your fingertips.": "Michelle",
  "We live in a connected world now. Some find that frightening. If people are downloading our music, they're listening to it. The internet is like radio for us.": "Jeff",
  "Stop trying to treat music like it's a tennis shoe, something to be branded. If the music industry wants to save money, they should take a look at some of their six-figure executive expense accounts. All those lawsuits can't be cheap, either.": "Jeff",
  "Music is very spiritual, it has the power to bring people together.": "Edgar",
  "We are just fans of music, we are not fans of a specific kind of music. We just happen to be a rock band. Until we explain ourselves, sometimes people don't understand why we limit ourselves to just being a rock band. It's because that is what we like doing.": "Joe",
  "I guess a good song is a good song is a good song, ya know.": "George",
  "At the age when Bengali youth almost inevitably writes poetry, I was listening to European classical music.": "Satyajit",
  "For over ten years or so game music has developed into a very large market.": "Nobuo",
  "Every music - except dance music, which is for dancing, I suppose - is for the spirit of the human being, and not for the body.": "Klaus",
  "Music enriches people's lives in the same way paintings and literature do. Everybody deserves that.": "Victoria",
  "The music is a personal expression, like art. It is something that you like doing that comes from within, and is an expression that comes from God. That is why artists are beautiful and why people who copy are not really artistic.": "Michael",
  "When today's generation reads Jack's books or they listen to the music created by some of us, I believe that they see there is a different way of approaching today's life and today's sometimes seeming hopelessness that can provide answers.": "David",
  "There's nothing like a good cheating song to make me want to run home to be with my wife.": "Steven",
  "I feel very blessed we can still have a career making music.": "Mike",
  "I was always drawn to Broadway musicals, and obviously composers like Gershwin, Rodgers, Berlin and Porter were writing music that I found wildly impressive.": "Marvin",
  "There's only two kinds of music I don't like... Country and Western.": "Bobby",
  "Music is always changing and the changes are unpredictable.": "Billy",
  "Every now and then, a lot of bands doing the same kind of music will organically sprout up at once.": "Kathy",
  "The market didn't define the music the music defined the market. ": "Charlie",
  "When we were shooting in Shreveport, me and a couple of friends went down to Lafayette, because they had a big Zydeco music festival down there. We spent two days dancing to Zydeco music, eating fried alligator... It was one of the craziest festivals I've ever been to in my life, but I loved it.": "Alexander",
  "Any good music must be an innovation.": "Les",
  "I feel most comfortable keeping versatile when it comes to music genres.": "Thia",
  "Music continues to remind me that its boundaries are limitless.": "Haley",
  "There's nothing like music to relieve the soul and uplift it.": "Mickey",
  "I thought the '60s was the most exciting time and the most vital music, and we were really together as one mind then. Then afterwards, the songs and the bad drugs, that took its toll.": "Mickey",
  "I love music so much I love what I do. I work very hard at being the best musician I can be because I love it.": "Diana",
  "Music can also be a sensual pleasure, like eating food or sex. But its highest vibration for me is that point of taking us to a real understanding of something in our nature which we can very rarely get at. It is a spiritual state of oneness.": "Terry",
  "I enjoy trying to inspire myself. I enjoy the artistic side of everything. Music, art, fashion, everything. I just like to be on the cutting edge of it. I'm into designing houses and interior design. I like change. I like creating things out of nothing.": "Chris",
  "True music must repeat the thought and inspirations of the people and the time.": "George",
  "It's amazing to hear, as a voice matures and then starts to decline, what kind of emotion is still conveyed by a really good vocalist.": "Tom",
  "You just pick up a chord, go twang, and you're got music.": "Sid",
  "When we separate music from life we get art.": "John",
  "There's a lot of music that sounds like it's literally computer-generated, totally divorced from a guy sitting down at an instrument.": "Aimee",
  "I find Indian music very funky. I mean it's very soulful, with their own kind of blues. But it's the only other school on the planet that develops improvisation to the high degree that you find in jazz music. So we have a lot of common ground.": "Mahavishnu",
  "Drugs, sex, booze, all the stuff that we wanted to do. The problem was that we didn't want to learn the top 40 'cause most of the music was awful and we had this other idea about what we wanted to do.": "Wayne",
  "I have tried to make the music a bit easier for them to understand.": "Nusrat",
  "I look at you and I write down what I hear.": "Virgil",
  "You can have music and it will stand alone by itself, but you can't have a movie without it.": "Jerry",
  "All music is beautiful.": "Billy",
  "I was bred and raised in a multi-cultural music background.": "Coco",
  "I would ditch school if my CD was scratched up or I couldn't get batteries. I wasn't trying to get on the bus and not be listening to music.": "Schoolboy",
  "Sometimes I'll have sections that I'm not quite sure how they fit in the puzzle of a tune, they'll get moved around; what I think was originally a verse ends up becoming the chorus, or what's an intro gets dropped as a hook, things get shifted around a lot.": "Gotye",
  "A good country song takes a page out of somebody's life and puts it to music.": "Conway",
  "I think it is the weak and the young and the minorities that you need to look after to get a healthy creative environment - to get a lot of choices, a lot of different styles of music, a lot experimental stuff that everyone else feeds off.": "Peter",
  "Do not take up music unless you would rather die than not do so.": "Nadia",
  "The whole problem can be stated quite simply by asking, 'Is there a meaning to music?' My answer would be, 'Yes.' And 'Can you state in so many words what the meaning is?' My answer to that would be, 'No.'": "Aaron",
  "If a literary man puts together two words about music, one of them will be wrong.": "Aaron",
  "Music's not like becoming a doctor, who can walk into a community and find people who need him.": "Charlie",
  "You have the ability to write melodies and to put lyrics that mean something: to speak about life and what people are going through in their every day ups and downs, the good times and the bad times. Country music has always talked about life, I think; that's what I've always loved about it.": "Jimi",
  "Composers shouldn't think too much - it interferes with their plagiarism.": "Howard",
  "In America, life is introverted, self-absorbed - and so is their music.": "Chris"
