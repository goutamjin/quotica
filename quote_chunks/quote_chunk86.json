Another time, Athena and Poseidon competed to be the patron god for the city of Athens. Your dad created some stupid saltwater spring for his gift. My mom created the olive tree.

Did I fight a lot with Thalia, since she was a daughter of Zeus? (I didn't answer that one.) If Annabeth's mother was Athena, the goddess of wisdom, then why didn't Annabeth know better than to fall off a cliff? (I tried not to strangle Nico for asking that one.) Was Annabeth my girlfriend? (At this point, I was ready to stick the kid in a meat-flavored sack and throw him to the wolves.)": "Rick",
  "As for my brothers,\" Zeus said, \"we are thankful\"-he cleared his throat like the words were hard to get out-\"erm, thankful for the aid of Hades.\"The lord of the dead nodded. He had a smug look on his face, but I figure he'd earned the right.

  "Correct.\" Kekrops sounded bitter, like he regretted his decision. \"My people were the original Athenians--the gemini.\"\"Like your zodiac sign?\" Percy asked. \"I'm a Leo.\"\"No, stupid,\" Leo said. \"I'm a Leo. You're a Percy.": "Rick",
  "Argh!\" Thalia pushed me, and a shock went through my body that blew me backward ten feet into the water. Some of the campers gasped. A couple of the Hunters stifled laughs.\"Sorry!\" Thalia said, turning pale. \"I didn't mean to\u2014\"Anger roared in my ears. A wave erupted from the creek, blasting into Thalia's face and dousing her from head to toe.I stood up. \"Yeah,\" I growled. \"I didn't mean to, either.\"Thalia was breathing heavily.\"Enough!\" Chiron ordered.But Thalia held out her spear. \"You want some, Seaweed Brain?\"Somehow, it was okay when Annabeth called me that \u2014 at least, I'd gotten used to it \u2014 but hearing it from Thalia was not cool.\"Bring it on, Pinecone Face!": "Rick",

  "For a long time,\u2019 Nico said, \u2018I had a crush on you. I just wanted you to know.\u2019 Percy looked at Nico. Then at Annabeth, as if to check that he\u2019d heard correctly. Then back at Nico. \u2018You \u2013\u2019 \u2018Yeah,\u2019 Nico said. \u2018You\u2019re a great person. But I\u2019m over that.

I mean, I see now \u2026 you\u2019re cute, but you\u2019re not my type.\u2019 \u2018I\u2019m not your type \u2026 Wait. So \u2013\u2019 \u2018See you around, Percy,\u2019 Nico said.": "Rick",
  "You must forge your own path for it to mean anything.": "Rick",
  "Hoover Dam,\" Thalia said. \"It's huge.\"We stood at the river's edge, looking up at a curve of concrete that loomed between the cliffs. People were walking along the top of the dam. They were so tiny they looked like fleas.The naiads had left with a lot of grumbling\u2014not in words I could understand, but it was obvious they hated this dam blocking up their nice river. Our canoes floated back downstream, swirling in the wake from the dam's discharge vents.\"Seven hundred feet tall,\" I said. \"Built in the 1930s.\"\"Five million cubic acres of water,\" Thalia said.Graver sighed. \"Largest construction project in the United States.\"Zoe stared at us. \"How do you know all that?\"\"Annabeth,\" I said. \"She liked architecture.\"\"She was nuts about monuments,\" Thalia said.\"Spouted facts all the time.\" Grover sniffled. \"So annoying.\"\"I wish she were here,\" I said.": "Rick",
  "Percy scowled. \"I-I know you.\"Nico raised his eyebrows. \"Do you?": "Rick",
  "We need music,\" Nico said. \"How's your singing?\"\"Um, no. Can't you just, like, tell it to open? You're the son of Hades and all.\"\"It's not so easy. We need music.\"I was pretty sure if I tried to sing, all I would cause was an avalanche.": "Rick",
  "Can\u2019t this thing go any faster?\u201d Thalia demanded.Zoe glared at her. \u201cI cannot control traffic.\u201dYou both sound like my mother,\u201d I said.Shut up!\u201d they both said in union.": "Rick",
  "The cord, a familiar voice said. Remember your lifeline, dummy!Suddenly there was a tug in my lower back. The current pulled at me, but it wasn't carrying me away anymore. I imagined the string in my back keeping me tied to the shore.\"Hold on, Seaweed Brain.\" It was Annabeth's voice, much clearer now. \"You're not getting away from me that easily.\"The cord strengthened.I could see Annabeth now- standing barefoot above me on the canoe lake pier. I'd fallen out of my canoe. That was it. She was reaching out her hand to haul me up, and she was trying not to laugh. She wore her orange camp T-shirt and jeans. Her hair was tucked up in her Yankees cap, which was strange because that should have made her invisible.\"You are such an idiot sometimes.\" She smiled. \"Come on. Take my hand.\"Memories came flooding back to me- sharper and more colorful. I stopped dissolving. My name was Percy Jackson. I reached up and took Annabeth's hand.": "Rick",
  "Save yourselves!\u201d Percy warned. \u201cIt is too late for us!\u201dThen he gasped and pointed to the spot where Frank was hiding. \u201cOh, no! Frank is turning into a crazy dolphin!\u201dNothing happ": "Rick",

  "Annabeth gripped the hilt of her dagger. \u201cA bounty on our heads . . . as if we didn\u2019t attract enough monsters already.\u201d\u201cDo we get WANTED posters?\u201d Leo asked. \u201cAnd do they have our bounties, like, broken down on a price li": "Rick",
  "Grover murmured, \"Well, Percy, what have we learned today?\"That three-headed dogs prefer red rubber balls over sticks?\"No,\" Grover told me. \"We've learned that your plans really, really bite!": "Rick",
  "You speak horse?\" Hazel asked.\"Speaking to horses is a Poseidon thing,\" Percy said. \"Uh, I mean a Neptune thing.\"\"Then you and Arion should get along fine,\" Hazel said. \"He's a son of Neptune too.\"Percy turned pale. \"Excuse me?": "Rick",
  "Brother,\u201d Artemis chided. \u201cYou do not help my Hunters. You do not look at, talk to, or flirt with my Hunters. And you do not call them sweetheart.": "Rick",
  "Not knowing is half the fun,\" Aphrodite said, \"Exquisitely painful isn't it? Not being sure who you love and who loves you? Oh, you kids! It's so cute I'm going to cry!": "Rick",
  "Tyson, Frank is a descendant of Poseidon.\"\"Brother!\" Tyson crushed Frank in a hug.Percy stifled a laugh. \"Actually he's more like a great-great-...Oh, never mind. Yeah, he's your brother.\"\"Thanks.\" Frank mumbled through a mouthful of flannel.": "Rick",
  "There is always a way out for those clever enough to find it.": "Rick",
  "Percy tried to remember. He really did. For some reason, Annabeth and he had visited a spa and decided to destroy it. He couldn't imagine why. Maybe they hadn't like the deep-tissue massage? Maybe they'd gotten bad manicures?": "Rick",
  "Lots of death, huh? Personally, I'm trying to avoid lots of death, but you guys have fun!": "Rick",
  "What if we promoted, like, Adidas shoes?\u2019 Percy wondered. \u2018Would that make Nike mad enough to show up?\" Leo smiled nervously. Maybe he and Percy did share something else \u2013 a stupid sense of humour. \"Yeah, I bet that would totally be against her sponsorship deal. THOSE ARE NOT THE OFFICIAL SHOES OF THE OLYMPICS! YOU WILL DIE NOW!": "Rick",
  "She looked at me, like she was drinking in the fact that I was still here. And I realized I was doing the same thing. The world was collapsing, and the only thing that really mattered to me was that she was alive.": "Rick",
  "Naturally, Coach Hedge went ballistic; but Percy found it hard to take the satyr seriously since he was barely five feet tall.\"Never in my life!\" Coach bellowed, waving his bat and knocking over a plate of apples. \"Against the rules! Irresponsible!\"\"Coach,\" Annabeth said, \"it was an accident. We were talking, and we fell asleep.\"\"Besides,\" Percy said, \"you're starting to sound like Terminus.\"Hedge narrowed his eyes. \"Is that an insult, Jackson? 'Cause I'll\u2014I'll terminus you, buddy!": "Rick",
  "Yeah, well,\u201d Nico said, \u201cnot giving people a second thought\u2026that can be dangerous.": "Rick",
  "What I did next was so impulsive and dangerous I should've been named ADHD poster child of the year.": "Rick",

  "Gabe scratched his double chin. \"Maybe if you hurry with the seven-layer dip...And maybe if the kid apologizes for interrupting my poker game.\"Maybe if I kick you in your soft spot, I thought. And make you sing Soprano for a week.": "Rick",
  "Nico strode forward. The enemy army fell back before him like he radiated death, which of course he did.Through the face guard of his skull-shaped helmet, he smiled. \"Got your message. Is it too late to join the party?\"\"Son of Hades.\" Kronos spit on the ground. \"Do you love death so much you wish to experience it?\"\"Your death,\" Nico said, \"would be great for me.\"\"I'm immortal, you fool! I have escaped Tartarus. You have no business here, and no chance to live.\"Nico drew his sword-three feet of wicked sharp Stygian iron, black as a nightmare. \"I don't agree.": "Rick",

  "Part of their problem was Percy.

Why you didn't want to talk about it.\"She took a deep breath. Then she brushed the pine needles out of her hair. \"If you tell anyone, I swear\u2014\"No, no,\" I said. \"That's cool. It's just\u2026 the daughter of Zeus, the Lord of the Sky, afraid of heights?": "Rick",

  "Images flashed through his mind. He saw Nico and his sister on a snowy mountain cliff in Maine, Percy Jackson protecting them from the manticore. Percy's sword gleamed in the dark. He'd been the first demigod Nico had ever seen in action. Later at Camp Half-Blood, Percy took Nico by the arm, promising to keep his sister Bianca safe. Nico believed him.

  "Annabeth frowned. \"That doesn't make sense. But why were you visiting --\" Her eyes widened. \"Hermes said you bear the curse of Achilles. Hestia said the same thing.

  "Grover Underwood of the satyrs!\" Dionysus called.Grover came forward nervously.\"Oh, stop chewing your shirt,\" Dionysus chided. \"Honestly, I'm not going to blast you. For your bravery and sacrifice, blah, blah, blah, and since we have an unfortunate vacancy, the gods have seen fit to name you a member of the Council of Cloven Elders.\"Grover collapsed on the spot.\"Oh, wonderful,\" Dionysus sighed, as several naiads came forward to help Grover. \"Well, when he wakes up, someone tell him that he will no longer be an outcast, and that all satyrs, naiads, and other spirits of nature will henceforth treat him as a lord of the Wild, with all rights, privileges, and honors, blah, blah, blah. Now please, drag him off before he wakes up and starts groveling.\"\"FOOOOOD,\" Grover moaned, as the nature spirits carried him away.I figured he'd be okay.

  "Your head is full of kelp.": "Rick",
  "If I had my way,\" Dionysus said, \"I would cause your molecules to erupt in flames. We'd sweep up the ashes and be done with a lot of trouble. But Chiron seems to feel this would be against my mission at this cursed camp: to keep you little brats safe from harm.\"\"Spontaneous combustion is a form of harm, Mr. D,\" Chiron put in.\"Nonsense,\" Dionysus said. \"Boy wouldn't feel a thing. Nevertheless, I've agreed to restrain myself. I'm thinking of turning you into a dolphin instead, sending you back to your father.": "Rick",
  "Very slowly, using only two fingers, Annabeth drew her dagger. Instead of dropping it, she tossed it as far as she could into the water.Octavian made a squeaking sound. \u201cWhat was that for?

His fiery armor was so bright it was hard to look at, and his matching Ray-Bans and perfect smile made him look like a male model for battle gear. \"God of medicine, at your service.\"He passed his hand over Annabeth's face and spoke an incantation. Immediately the bruises faded. Her cuts and scars disappeared. Her arm straightened, and she sighed in her sleep.Apollo grinned. \"She'll be fine in a few minutes.

  "Right before the game, she strolled up to me. \"Hey, Seaweed Brain.\"\"Will you stop calling me that?\"She knows I hate that name, mostly because I never have a good comeback.

  "Terminus sniffed. \u201cI guard borders. I don\u2019t kill giants. It\u2019s not in my job description.": "Rick",
  "There was Tyson moving into the Poseidon cabin, giggling to himself every fifteen seconds and saying, \"Percy is my brother?\" like he'd just won the lottery.Aw, Tyson,\" I'd say. \"It's not that simple.": "Rick",
  "Yay!' he said. 'Now we can eat peanut butter sandwiches and ride fish ponies! We can fight monsters and see Annabeth and make things go BOOM!": "Rick",
  "One down,\" Beckendorf said. \"About five thousand to go.\" He tossed me a jar of thick green liquid\u2014Greek fire, one of the most dangerous magical substances in the world. Then he threw me another essential tool of demigod heroes\u2014duct tape": "Rick",
  "There's no point in defending camp if you guys die. All our friends are here.": "Rick",
  "Juniper: Are you guys busy? Percy: Well, we\u2019re in the middle of this game against a bunch of monsters and we\u2019re trying not to die. Annabeth: We\u2019re not busy. ": "Rick",
  "Fish Ponies! I put them on the ceiling!\" -Tyson": "Rick",
  "Bianca, camp is cool! It's got a pegasus stable and a sword-fighting arena and\u2026 I mean, what do you get by joining the Hunters?\"To begin with,\" Zoe said, \"immortality.\"I stared at her, then at Artemis. \"She's kidding, right?\"Zoe rarely kids about anything,\" Artemis said. \"My Hunters follow me on my adventures. They are my maidservants, my companions, my sisters-in-arms. Once they swear loyalty to me, they are indeed immortal\u2026 unless they fall in battle, which is unlikely. Or break their oath.\"What oath?\" I said.To foreswear romantic love forever,\" Artemis said. To never grow up, never get married. To be a maiden eternally.\"Like you?\"The goddess nodded.I tried to imagine what she was saying. Being immortal. Hanging out with only middle-school girls forever. I couldn't get my mind around it.": "Rick",
  "The jogger sighed. He pulled out his phone and my eyes got big, because it glowed with a bluish light. When he extended the antenna, two creatures began writhing around it-green snakes, no bigger than earthworms.The jogger didn't seem to notice. He checked his LCD display and cursed. \"I've got to take this. Just a sec ...\" Then into the phone: \"Hello?\" He listened. The mini-snakes writhed up and down the antenna right next to his ear.Yeah,\" the jogger said. \"Listen-I know, but... I don't care if he is chained to a rock with vultures pecking at his liver, if he doesn't have a tracking number, we can't locate his package....A gift to humankind, great... You know how many of those we deliver-Oh, never mind. Listen, just refer him to Eris in customer service. I gotta go.": "Rick",
  "I see you like to study,\u201d I said. \u201cWell done.\u201dPercy snorted. \u201cI hate to study. I\u2019ve been guaranteed admission with a full scholarship to New Rome University, but they\u2019re still requiring me to pass all my high school courses and score well on the SAT. Can you believe that? Not to mention I have to pass the DSTOMP.\u201d\u201cThe what?\u201d Meg asked.\u201cAn exam for Roman demigods,\u201d I told her. \u201cThe Demigod Standard Test of Mad Powers.\u201dPercy frowned. \u201cThat\u2019s what it stands for?\u201d\u201cI should know. I wrote the music and poetry analysis sections.\u201d\u201cI will never forgive you for that,\u201d Percy said.": "Rick",
  "That's us,\" he said. \"Those five nuts right there.\"\"Which one is me?\" I asked.\"The little deformed one,\" Zoe suggested.\"Oh, shut up.": "Rick",
  "Snake people do not drink milk,\" Kekrops said. \"We are lactose intolerant reptiles.\"\"Me too!\" Frank said. \"I mean . . . lactose intolerant. Not a reptile. Though I can be a reptile sometimes-": "Rick",
  "I hoped I wasn't blushing. It was bad enough I had to depend on my mom to drive me to my battles.": "Rick",
  "then things got even stranger.Mr. Brunner, who'd been out in front of the museum a minute before, wheeled his chair into the doorway of the gallery, holding a pen in his hand. \"What ho, Percy!\" he shouted, and tossed the pen through the air.Mrs. Dodds lunged at me.With a yelp, I dodged and felt talons slash the air next to my ear. I snatched the ballpoint pen out of the air, but when it hit my hand, it wasn't a pen anymore. It was a sword-Mr. Brunner's bronze sword, which he always used on tourement day.Mrs. Dodds spun toward me with a murderous look in her eyes.My knees were jelly. My hands were shaking so bad I almost dropped the sword.She snarled, \"Die, honey!\"And she flew straight at me.Absolute terror ran through my body. I did the only thing that came naturally:I swung the sword.The metal blade hit her shoulder and passed through her body as if she were made made of water. Hisss!Mrs. Dodds was a sand castle in a power fan. She exploded into yellow powder, vaporized on the spot, leaving nothing but the smell of sulfur and a dying screech and a chill of evil in the air, as if those two glowing red eyes were still watching me.": "Rick",
  "We only came close to dying six or seven times which I thought was pretty good. A minute later Annabeth hit a slippery patch of moss and her foot slipped. Fortunately she found something else to put it against. Unfortunately that something was my face.": "Rick",
  "Nico clenched his sword. Sharing his secret crush hadn\u2019t been the worst of it. Eventually he might have done that, in his own time, in his own way. But being forced to talk about Percy, being bullied and harassed and strong-armed simply for Cupid\u2019s amusement \u2026 Tendrils of darkness were now spreading out from his feet, killing all the weeds between the cobblestones. Nico tried to rein in his anger.": "Rick",
  "And I was holding someone who was destined to be my best friend, or possibly my worst enemy.": "Rick",
  "Getting eaten by a giant crocodile was bad enough.The kid with the glowing sword only made my day worse.": "Rick",
  "The way to beat Luke,\" he said. \"If I'm right, it's the only way you'll stand a chance.\"I took a deep breath. \"Okay. I'm listening.\"Nico glanced inside my room. His eyebrows furrowed.\"Is that...is that blue birthday cake?\"He sounded hungry, maybe a little wistful. I wondered if the poor kid had ever had a birthday party, or if he'd ever even been invited to one.:Come inside for cake and ice cream,\" I said. \"It sounds like we've got a lot to talk about.": "Rick",
  "Whoa,\" said Nico as he climbed off the bus. \"Is that a climbing wall?\"\"Yeah,\" I (Percy) said.\"Why is there lava pouring down it?\"\"Little extra challenge...\" - Percy": "Rick",
  "But Annabeth just smiled and put us in jail. As she was heading back to the front line, she turned and winked. \"See you at the fireworks?\"She didn't even wait for my answer before darting off into the woods.I looked at Beckendorf. \"Did she just...ask me out?\"He shrugged, completely disgusted. \"Who knows with girls? Give me a haywire dragon, any day.\"So we sat together and waited while the girls won the game.": "Rick",
  "Blood trickled from the corner of her (Annabeth) mouth. She croaked, \"Family, Luke. You promised.\"Luke stared at the knife in Annabeth's hand, the blood on her face. \"Promise.\" Then he gasped like he couldn't get air. \"Annabeth . . .\" But it wasn't the Titan's voice. It was Luke's. He stumbled forward like he couldn't control his own body. \"You're bleeding. . . .\" He gasped again.\"He's changing. Help. He's . . . he's almost ready. He won't need my body anymore. Please\u2014\"\"The knife, Percy,\" Annabeth muttered. Her breath was shallow. \"Hero . . . cursed blade . . .\"Luke turned and collapsed, clutching his ruined hands.\"Please, Percy . . .\"Luke seemed to know what I was thinking. He moistened his lips. \"You can't . . . can't do it yourself. He'll break my control. He'll defend himself. Only my hand. I know where. I can . . . can keep him controlled.\"I raised the knife to strike. Then I looked at Annabeth, at Grover. And I finally understood what she'd been trying to tell me. You are not the hero, Rachel had said. It will affect what you do. The line from the great prophecy echoed in my head: A hero's soul, cursed blade shall reap. My whole world tipped upside down,and I gave the knife to Luke.I watched as Luke grasped the hilt he stabbed himself": "Rick",
  "The thing about plummetting downhill at fifty miles an hour on a snack platter - if you realize it's a bad idea when you're halfway down, it's too late.": "Rick",
  "So,\" Annabeth said, \"are you going to argue about me coming along?\"\"Nah. You'd just beat me up.\" Percy said.She managed a laugh, which was good to hear": "Rick",
  "Seven half-bloods shall answer the callTo storm or fire the world must fallAn oath to keep with a final breathand foes bear arms to the doors of death": "Rick",
  "Stop!\" he yelled at the others. \"Multigrain fighting is not allowed!": "Rick",
  "Poseidon grinned. \"You're doing well with those new cabins, by the way. I suppose this means I can claim all those other sons and daughters of mine and send you some siblings next summer.\"\"Ha-ha.\"Poseidon reeled in his empty line.I shifted my feet. \"Um, you were kidding, right?\"Poseidon gave me one of his inside-joke winks, and I still didn't know whether he was serious or not. ": "Rick",
  "your loved ones have been used to lure you into Kronos's traps. Your fatal flaw is personal loyalty Percy. You do not know when it is time to cut your losses. To save a friend you would sacrifice the world.": "Rick",
  "I stared at her. Maybe I wasn't the brightest guy in the world when it came to girls, but I was pretty sure Rachel had just dumped me, which was lame considering we'd never even been together.": "Rick",
  "I love New York. You can pop out of the Underworld in Central Park, hail a taxi, head down Fifth Avenue with a giant hellhound loping along behind you, and nobody even looks at you funny.Of course, the Mist helped. People probably couldn't see Mrs. O'Leary, or maybe they thought she was a large,loud,very friendly truck.": "Rick",
  "He slung off his backpack. He'd managed to grab a lot of supplies at the Napa Bargain Mart: a portable GPS, duct tape, lighter, superglue, water bottle, camping roll, a Comfy Panda Pillow Pet (as seen on TV), and a Swiss army knife\u2014pretty much every tool a modern demigod could want.": "Rick",
  "Nico, you can do this,\" Jason said. \"It might be embarrassing, but it's for the scepter.\"Nico didn't look convinced. In fact he looked like he was going to be sick. But he squared his shoulders and nodded. \"You're right. I- I'm not afraid of a love god.\"Favonius beamed. \"Excellent! Would you like a snack before you go?": "Rick",
  "Question (from a reader) : Will the Wise Goddess Athena overthrow Zeus and become the ruler of Olympus?Athena's answer : What an interesting idea . . . No, just kidding, Dad. Put away the lightning bolt.": "Rick",
  "I sat up in bed. \"What did he say?\"Tyson groaned, still half asleep. He was lying facedown on the couch, his feet so far over the edge they were in the bathroom. \"The happy man said...bowling practice?\"I hoped he was right, but then there was an urgent knock on the suite's interior door. Annabeth stuck her head in--her blonde hair in a rat's nest. \"DISEMBOWLING practice?": "Rick",
  "I turned and faced the Olympians.\"We need a shroud,\" I announced, my voice cracking. \"A shroud for the son of Hermes.": "Rick",
  "Percy\u2019d heard stories about amputees who had phantom pains where their missing legsand arms used to be. That\u2019s how his mindfelt\u2014like his missing memories were aching.": "Rick",
  "I slashed a wide arc with Riptide and vaporized the entire front row of monsters.Back off!\u201d I yelled at the rest, trying to sound fierce. Behind them stood their instructor\u2014a six-foot-tall telekhine with Doberman fangs snarling at me. I did my best to stare him": "Rick",
  "Poseidon held out his arms and gave me a hug. I realized, a little embarrassed, that I'd never actually hugged my dad before. He was warm\u2014like a regular human\u2014and he smelled of a salty beach and fresh sea air.": "Rick",
  "Earthshaker, Stormbreaker, Father of Horses. Hail, Perseus Jackson, Son of the Sea God": "Rick",
  "I lost hope when I saw the horses\u2019 teeth.As I got closer to the fence, I held my shirt over my nose to block the smell. One stallion waded through the muck and whinnied angrily at me. He bared his teeth, which were pointed like a bear\u2019s.I tried to talk to him in my mind. I can do that with most h": "Rick",
  "Tyson was still staring at Chiron in amazement. He whimpered like he wanted to pat Chiron's flank but was afraid to come closer. \"Pony?": "Rick",
  "You promised you would protect her Nico said. He might as well have stabbed me with a rusty dagger.It would've hurt less than reminding me of my promise.": "Rick",
  "Percy grunted. \u2018Probably something to do with that creep Octavian. Maybe he was so bad at telling the future that he broke Apollo\u2019s powers.": "Rick",
  "Percy: \u201cYou asked Poseidon for\u2026 me?\u201d Tyson: \"For a friend, young cyclopes grow up alone on the streets, learns to make things out of scraps. Learn to survive.\" Percy: \u201cBut that\u2019s so cruel!\u201d Tyson: \u201cMakes us appreciate blessings, not be greedy and mean and fat like Polyphemus. But I got scared. Monsters chased me so much, clawed me sometimes--\" Percy: \u201cThe scars on your back?\u201d Tyson: \u201cSphinx on Seventy-second Street. Big Bully. I prayed to Daddy for help. Soon the people at Meriwether found me. Mey you. Biggest blessing ever. Sorry I said Poseidon was mean. He sent me a brother.": "Rick",
  "That is correct,\" Zeus said. \"The blood of Olympus was spilled. She is fully conscious.\"\"Oh, come on!\" Percy complained. \"I get a little nosebleed and I wake up the entire earth? That's not fair!": "Rick",
  "So I took her hand, and I don't know what everybody else heard, but to me it sounded like a slow dance: a little sad, but maybe a little hopeful, too.": "Rick",
  "He was making a brave attempt, but Jason could see the sadness lingering in his eyes. Something had happened to him... something to do with Calypso.": "Rick",
  "Percy Jackson,\" Hermes said, \"because you have taken on the curse of Achilles, I must spare you. You are in the hands of the Fates now. But you will never speak to me like that again. You have no idea how much I have sacrificed, how much\u2014\"His voice broke, and he shrank back to human size. \"My son, my greatest pride . . . my poor May . . .\"He sounded so devastated I didn't know what to say. One minute he was ready to vaporize us. Now he looked like he needed a hug.": "Rick",
  "I should throw you off this building minus the flying horse and see how heroic you sound on the way down.": "Rick",
  "Then something occurred to me.\"Get closer,\" I told Blackjack.He whinnied in protest.\"Just within shouting distance,\" I said. \"I need to talk to the statue.\"Now I'm sure you've lost it, boss, Blackjack said": "Rick",
  "If my mom told one more story about how cute I looked in the bathtub when I was three years old I was going to burrow into the snow and freeze myself to death.": "Rick",
  "Your former friend Luke \" Poseidon corrected. \"He once promised things like that. He was Hermes's pride and joy. Just bear that in mind Percy. Even the bravest can fall.": "Rick",
  "You're cute when you're worried, your eyebrows get all scrunched together.": "Rick",
  "My only thought was to keep him away from Annabeth.": "Rick",
  "Paul patted Mrs. O'Leary's snout. The living room shook \u2014BOOM, BOOM, BOOM\u2014which either meant a SWAT team was breaking down the door or Mrs. O'Leary was wagging her tail.I couldn't help but smile.": "Rick",
  "Annabeth Thalia and I hadn't seen each other in months but between the blizzard and the thought of what we were about to do we were too nervous to talk much. Except for my mom. She talks more when she's nervous. By the time we finally got to Westover Hall it was getting dark and she'd told Annabeth and Thalia every embarrassing baby story there was to tell about me.": "Rick",
  "Grover started to sniffle and I figured if I didn't cheer him up he'd either start bawling or chewing up my mattress. He tends to eat household objects whenever he gets upset.": "Rick",
  "Maybe it's okay to still be a kid every once in a while.": "Rick",
  "Beckendorf closed eyes tight and brought his hand up to his watch.from that distance, the explosion shook the world. Heat seared the back of my head. The Princess Andromeda blew up from both sides, a massive fireball ofgreen flame roiling into the dark sky, consuming everything....I stared out the window into deep blue water. Beckendorf was supposed to go to college in the fall. He had a girlfriend, lots of friends, his whole life ahead of him. He couldn't be gone.": "Rick",
  "You said your mom is the goddess of balance,\" I reminded him. \"The minor gods deserve better, Ethan, but total destruction isn't balance. Kronos doesn't build. He only destroys.": "Rick",
  "The Minotaur unstrapped his axe and swung it around. It was beautiful in a harsh I\u2019m~going~togut~you~like~a~fish kind of way. Each of its twin blades was shaped like an omega: \u03a9\u2014the last letter of the Greek alphabet. Maybe that was because the axe would be the last thing his victims ever saw": "Rick",
  "I was flying right toward him (the pig) at the speed of demigod-smashing.": "Rick",
  "It was almost enough to make me turn vegetarian, except for the pesky fact that I loved cheeseburgers.": "Rick",
  "Street performances?\"\"A little singing. A little martial arts. Some interpretive dance.\"\"Wow.\"\"I know! The Portuguese have taste.": "Nico",
  "No,\" Frank said. \"I'm only a centurion.\"Jason cursed in Latin. \"He means he can't control a whole legion. He's not of high enough rank.\"Nico swung back his black sword at another gryphon. \"Well, then, promote him!": "Rick",
  "He scowled at Jason. \"And please, I don't like being touched. Don't ever grab me again.": "Rick",
  "If you look at it from any other side, it looks like a pile of enormous deer droppings, but Chiron wouldn't let us call the place the Poop Pile, especially after it had been named for Zeus, who doesn't have much of a sense of humor.": "Rick",
  "No,\" I said. \"I choose the prophecy. It will be about me.\"\"Why are you saying that?\" she cried. \"You want to be responsible for the whole world?\"It was the last thing I wanted, but I didn't say that. I knew I had to step up and claim it.\"I can't let Nico be in any more danger,\" I said. \"I owe that much to his sister. I\u2026let themboth down. I'm not going to let that poor kid suffer any more.": "Rick",
  "Bob says hello,\" he told the stars.": "Rick",
  "The truth hit him. Jason wasn't quite Roman anymore. His time at Camp Half-Blood had changed him. Reyna had recognized that. Apparently, so did the undead legionnaires. If Jason no longer gave off the right sort of vibe, or aura of a Roman leader...": "Rick",
  "Correct.\" Kekrops sounded bitter, like he regretted his decision. \"My people were the original Athenians--the gemini.\"\"Like your zodiac sign?\" Percy asked. \"I'm a Leo.\"\"No, stupid. \"I'm a Leo. You're a Percy.": "Rick",
  "We heard the army before we saw it.The noise was like a cannon barrage combined with a football stadium crowd- like every Patriots fan in New England was charging us with bazookas.": "Rick",
  "Seriously, who curses you with their dying breath and says, I hope your eye twitches!": "Rick",
  "Percy hefted a bronze grenade. \u2018I hope you labelled these right.\u2019 He yelled, \u2018Die, Romans!\u2019 and lobbed the grenade over the wall.": "Rick",
  "Annabeth shook her head. \"All these years sneaking around, and we could've just been ourse": "Rick",
  "We were ten feet away when we triggered the First Law of Percy Jackson": "Rick",
  "Percy's ears turned as pink as Alex's jeans. \"Anyway, maybe we've been looking at this all wrong. I've been tying to teach you sea skills. But the most important thing is to use whatever you've got to hand - your team, your wits, the enemy's own magical stuff.\"\"And there's no way to plan for that,\" I said.\"Exactly!\" Percy said. \"My work here is done!\"Annabeth frowned. \"Percy, you're saying the best plan is no plan. As a child of Athena, I can't really endorse that.": "Rick",
  "But I suppose if you're friends of Magnus's ...\" He went completely still. His runes faded. Then he leaped out of my hand and flew towards Annabeth, his blade twitching as if he was stiffing the air. \"Where is she? Where are you hiding the babe?\"Annabeth backed towards the rail. \"Whoa, there, sword. Personal space?\"\"Jack, behave,\" Alex said. \"What are you doing?\"\"She's around here somewhere,\" Jack insisted. He flew to Percy. \"Aha! What's in your pocket, sea boy?\"\"Excuse me?\" Percy looked a bit nervous about the magical sword hovering at his wais": "Rick",
  "The only strange thing about Jackson was the tattoo on the inside of his forearm - a trident as dark as seared wood, with a single line underneath and the letters": "Rick",
  "Annabeth frowned. \"Percy's sword is a": "Rick",
  "Congratulations, man. What's her name?\"\"Estelle. It was my grandmother's name. Um, on my mom's side, obviously. Not Poseidon's.\"\"I approve,\" Alex said. \"Old-fashioned and elegant. Estelle Jac": "Rick",

  "They\u2019d seen his deepest secrets. They knew who he was, what he was. But they didn\u2019t seem to care. No \u2026 they cared more. They weren\u2019t judging him. They were concerned.": "Rick",

  "Nosoi?\u201d Percy planted his feet in a fighting stance. \u201cYou know, I keep thinking, I have now killed every single thing in Greek mythology. But the list never seems to end.\u201d\u201cYou haven\u2019t killed me yet,\u201d I noted.\u201cDon\u2019t tempt me.": "Rick",
  "You\u2019re gonna be like Aquaman?\u201d she asked. \u201cGet the fish to fight for you?\u201d\u201cThanks,\u201d Percy said. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard enough Aquaman jokes for one lifetime.": "Rick",

Immediately we\u2019ll notice that we are being followed. Then we\u2019ll end up in a big battle that totals my family car and probably destroys the whole freeway. Then we\u2019ll have to run all the way to camp.\u201dMeg\u2019s eyes widened. \u201cYou can tell the future?\u201d\"Don\u2019t need to.\u201d Percy changed lanes to one that was crawling slightly less slowly. \u201cI\u2019ve just done this a lot.": "Rick",

It tasted almost as good as ambrosia nachos. \u201cYou will have immortal fame for this, Sally Jackson!": "Rick",
  "But Percy Jackson has always been reliable. You have nothing to fear. Besides, he likes me. I taught him everything he knows.\u201dShe frowned. \u201cYou did?\u201dI found her innocence somewhat charming. So many obvious things she did not know. \u201cOf course. Now let\u2019s go up.": "Rick",
  "This brings to mind an expression I coined ages ago: A peach a day keeps the plague spirits away!'Percy sneezed. 'I though it was apples and doctors.'The karpos hissed.'Or peaches,' Percy said. 'Peaches work too.''Peaches,' agrees the karpos.Percy wiped his nose. 'Not criticizing, but why is her grooting?": "Rick",
  "You do understand that I must find a way to return to Olympus,\u201d I said. \u201cThis will probably involve many harrowing trials with a high chance of death. Can you turn down such glory?\u201d\u201cYeah, I\u2019m pretty sure I can. Sorry.\u201dI pursed my lips. It always disappointed me when mortals put themselves first and failed to see the big picture\u2014the importance of putting me first\u2014but I had to remind myself that this young man had helped me out on many previous occasions": "Rick",

I guess we both knew it. Still, I felt like somebody was poking my heart with a cold metal rod.\"How did you know?\" \"Know what?\" I looked around to make sure we were alone. Then I leaned in close and whispered: \"My Achilles spot. If you hadn't taken that knife, I would've died.\"She got a faraway look in her eyes. Her breath smelled like grapes, maybe from the nectar. \"I don't know, Percy. I just had this feeling you were in danger. Where... where is the spot?\"I wasn't supposed to tell anyone. But this was Annabeth. If I couldn't trust her, I couldn't trust anyone. \"The small of my back.\"She lifted her hand. \"Where? Here?\"She put her hand on my spine, and my skin tingled. I moved her fingers to the one spot that grounded me to my mortal life. A thousand volts of electricity seemed to arc through my body. \"You saved me.\" I said. \"Thanks.\" She removed her hand, but I kept holding it. \"So you owe me,\" she said weakly. \"What else is new?": "Rick",
  "Like your zodiac sign?' Percy asked. 'I'm a Leo.''No, stupid,' Leo said. 'I'm a Leo. You're a Percy.": "Rick",
  "Percy stared at his jelly donut. He had a rocky history with Nico di Angelo. The guy had once tricked him into visiting Hades's palace, and Percy had ended up in a cell. But most of the time, Nico sided with the good guys.

  "Percy pulled Annabeth close and kissed her... long enough for it to get really awkward for Piper, though she said nothing. She thought about the old rule of Aphrodite's cabin: that to be recognized as a daughter of the love goddess, you had to break someone's heart. Piper had long ago decided to change that rule. Percy and Annabeth were a perfect example of why. You should have to make someone's heart whole. That was a much better test.When Percy pulled away, Annabeth looked like a fish gasping for air.'The Rivalry end here,' Percy said. 'I love you, Wise Girl.": "Rick",
  "All aboard for one last trip.": "Rick",
  "Nico di Angelo ran up to me with a big grin on his face.\"Percy, this is awesome!\" His blue-feathered bronze helmet was falling in his eyes, and his breastplate was about six sizes too big. I wondered if there was any way I'd looked that ridiculous when I'd first arrived.": "Rick",

  "Yeah, you bet Romani.' Percy bared his forearm and showed them the brand he'd got at Camp Jupiter- the SPQR mark, with the trident of Neptune. 'You mix Greek and Roman, and you know what you get? You get BAM!' He stomped his foot, and the empousai scrambled back. One fell off the boulder where she'd been perched.": "Rick",
  "I (Percy) set Nico on guard duty with Beckendorf and the Stoll brothers, figuring he'd be safely out of the way....\"What's happening?\" Nico demanded, trying to climb up next to me.": "Rick",

  "What if we promoted, like, Adidas shoes?\u2019 Percy wondered. \u2018Would that make Nike mad enough to show up?'Leo smiled nervously.

  "As soon as the rocky coast line of the island came into view, I ordered one of the ropes to wrap around Annabeth's waist, tying her to the foremast. \"Don't untie me,\" she said, \"no matter what happens or how much I plead. I'll want to go straight over the edge and drown myself.\" \"Are you trying to tempt me?\"\"Ha-ha.": "Rick",

Frank had turned -clothes, backpack, and all- into a koi the size of a teen-aged boy.\"dude.\" Percy sent his thoughts through the water, the way he spoke to other sea creatures. \"A goldfish?\"Frank's voice came back to him: \"I freaked. We were talking about goldfish, so it was on my mind. Sue me.": "Rick",

  "Then Leo realized something was blocking the middle of his view. Something large and fuzzy, and so close, Leo had to cross his eyes to see it properly. It was a large, ugly face. \"Holy mother!\" he yelped. The face backed away and came into focus. Staring down at him was a beard man in grimy blue coveralls. His face was lumpy and covered with welts, as if he'd been stung by a million bees, or dragged across gravel. Possibly both. \"Humph.\" the man said. \"Holy father, boy. I should think ou know the difference by now.": "Rick",

  "The driver got out smiling. He looked about seventeen or eighteen, and for a second, I had the uneasy feeling it was Luke, my old enemy. This guy had the same sandy hair and outdoorsy good looks. But it wasn't Luke. His smile was brighter and more playful. (Luke didn't do much more than scowl and sneer these days.) The Maserati driver wore jeans and loafers and a sleeveless T-shirt.\"Wow\" Thalia muttered. Apollo Is hot.\"\"He's the sun god,\" I said.\"That's not what I meant.": "Rick",
  "The goddess smiled. \"You are a good hero, Percy Jackson. Not too proud. I like that. But you have much to learn. When Dionysus was made a god, I gave up my throne for him. It was the only way to avoid a civil war among the gods.\"\"It unbalanced the Council,\" I remembered. \"Suddenly there were seven guys and five girls.\"Hestia shrugged. \"It was the best solution, not a perfect one. Now I tend the fire. I fade slowly into the background. No one will ever write epic poems about the deeds of Hestia. Most demigods don't even stop to talk to me. But that is no matter.

  "She led him past the engine room, which looked like a very dangerous, mechanized jungle gym, with pipes and pistons and tubes jutting from a central bronze sphere.

  "Percy looked at Coach Hedge and Frank. \u201cA trap?\u201d\u201cProbably,\u201d Frank said. \u201cShe\u2019s not mortal,\u201d Hedge said, sniffing the air. \u201cProbably some kind of goat-eating, demigod-destroying fiend from Tartarus.\u201d\u201cNo doubt,\u201d Percy agreed. \u201cAwesome.\u201d Hedge grinned. \u201cLet\u2019s go.": "Rick",
  "You both passed out,\u201d Percy said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why, but Ella told me not to worry about it. She said you were\u2026sharing?\u201d\u201cSharing,\u201d Ella agreed. She crouched in the stern, preening her wing feathers with her teeth, which didn\u2019t look like a very effective form of personal hygiene. She spit out some red fluff. \u201cSharing is good. No more blackouts. Biggest American blackout, August 14, 2003. Hazel shared. No more blackouts.\u201dPercy scratched his head. \u201cYeah\u2026we\u2019ve been having conversations like that all night. I still don\u2019t know what she\u2019s talking about.": "Rick",
  "Frank tugged again with no luck. Even Hazel was trying not to laugh.Frank grimaced with concentration. Suddenly, he disappeared. On the deck where he\u2019d been standing, a green iguana crouched next to an empty set of Chinese handcuffs.\u201cWell done, Frank Zhang,\u201d Leo said dryly, doing his impression of Chiron the centaur. \u201cThat is exactly how people beat Chinese handcuffs. They turn into iguanas.": "Rick",
  "Percy and Reyna occupied matching praeters' chairs on the dais, which made Percy self-conscious. It wasn't easy looking dignified wearing a bedsheet and a purple cape. \"The camp is safe,\" Octavian continued. \" I'll be the first to congragulate our heroes for bringing back the legion's eagle and so much Imperial gold! Truly we have been blessed with good fortune. But why do more? Why tempt fate?\" \"I'm glad you asked.\" Percy stood, taking the question as an opening.

  "I looked at the campers, all of them grim and determined. I tried not to feel like this was the last time I'd ever see them all together. 'You're the greatest heroes of this millennium,' I told them. 'It doesn't matter how many monsters come at you. Fight bravely, and we will win.' I raised Riptide and shouted, 'FOR OLYMPUS!'

Of something meant to be. The feeling brings tears to my eyes. Perhaps we can take a step forward together.\u201cHi,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m Daniel.\u201d \u201cHi,\u201d I reply. \u201cI\u2019m June.": "Marie",

  "God saw Hansen tighten his chokehold on Day and he could see his lover fighting to breathe. Day\u2019s ears and neck were bright red. His lips were turning a darker color as his body was deprived of oxygen. Hansen pressed the barrel in deeper and yelled.\u201cTwo minutes and fifteen seconds before I get to zero and I provide the great state of Georgia the luxury of one less narc.\u201dGod\u2019s mind exploded at the thought of not having Day in a world he lived in. He looked into his partner\u2019s glistening eyes and saw he was turning blue and possibly getting ready to faint. Day was still looking at him, looking into God\u2019s green eyes.No, no, no! He\u2019s saying good-bye.God closed his eyes and released a loud, gut-wrenching growl cutting off the SWAT leader\u2019s negotiations.\u201cGodfrey, get yourself under control,\u201d his captain said while grabbing for him.God jerked himself away from the hold and stepped forward, his angry eyes boring into Hansen\u2019s dark ones. Hansen stared at him as if God was crazy. Little did he know God was at that moment.\u201cGodfrey, get back here and stand down. That\u2019s an order, Detective!\u201d his captain barked.God\u2019s large hands clenched at his sides fighting not to pull out his weapons. He ground his teeth together so hard his jaw ached.\u201cDo you have any idea of the shit storm you\u2019re about to bring down on your life,\u201d God spoke with a menacing snarl while his large frame shook with fury. \u201cIn your arms you hold the only thing in this world that means anything to me. The man that you are pointing a gun at is my only purpose for living. You are threating to kill the only person in this world that gives a fuck about me.\u201dGod took two more steps forward and was vaguely aware of the complete silence surrounding him. Hansen\u2019s finger hovered shakily over the trigger as he took two large steps back with Day still tight against his chest.God growled again and he saw a shade of fear ghost over Hansen\u2019s sweaty face.\u201cIf you kill that man, I swear on everything that is holy, I will track you to the ends of the earth, killing and destroying any and everything you hold dear. I will take everything from you and leave you alive to suffer through it. I will bestow upon you the same misery that you have given to me.\u201dHansen shook his head and inched closer to the door behind him.\u201cStay back,\u201d he yelled again but this time the demand lacked the courage and venom he exhibited before.\u201cYou kill that man, and you\u2019ll have no idea of the monster you will create. Have you ever met a man with no heart\u2026no conscience\u2026no soul\u2026no purpose?\u201d God rumbled, his voice at least twelve octaves lower than the already deep baritone.God yanked his Desert Eagle from his holster in a flash and cocked the hammer back chambering the first round. Hansen stumbled back again, his eyes gone wide with fear.God\u2019s entire body instinctually flexed every muscle in his body and it felt like the large vein in his neck might rupture. His body burned like he had a sweltering fever and he knew his wrath had him a brilliant shade of red.\u201cI\u2019m asking you a goddamn question, Hansen! No soul! No conscience! I\u2019m asking you have you ever met the devil!\u201d God\u2019s thunderous voice practically rattled the glass in the hanger.\u201cIf you kill the man I love, you better make your peace with God, because I\u2019m gonna meet your soul in hell.\u201d His voice boomed.": "A.E.",
  "Baby,\u201d Day said softly, his throat still sore from being choked.God turned around slowly and faced him. Day choked up at the pained expression on his man\u2019s face. He could see that God\u2019s eyes were moist and red-rimmed. Day inched toward him and didn\u2019t stop until he was pressed against that broad chest. God\u2019s strong arms came around him and squeezed him hard. The guttural moan the man released against his temple made Day\u2019s heart seize.God pulled back and gripped a handful of Day\u2019s hair pulling so that he was looking up at him. God bent down and oh so gently grazed his soft lips across his. Day\u2019s body vibrated from the sensual feeling. God rubbed his face all over Day\u2019s as if he was marking him with his scent. God\u2019s grip tightened in his hair and he moaned again. Day could feel God\u2019s body trembling and Day didn\u2019t know at that moment if the shaking was from residual fear or need, so he didn\u2019t move as he let his lover do what he needed to do.God released the punishing grip and his large palms shook as they ghosted over Day\u2019s face. His chin was tilted up by firm fingers and again was blessed with feathery-soft kisses. God leaned back in and draped his arms completely around him and Day embraced him back. The soft piano from the album serenaded them and God just barely rocked their bodies back and forth in a very slow dance. Every few seconds he\u2019d stop to place kisses on his forehead before leaning back in.": "A.E.",
  "Do me a favor, Ro,\u201d Day said calmly.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d Ronowski peeked around Johnson again.\u201cJohnson won\u2019t be with you all the time. Remind me to kick your ass later,\u201d Day said.Ronowski came to stand in front of Day, looked at his watch and smirked. \u201cSure, what time works for you?\u201dDay looked at his watch too. \u201cUhhh, let\u2019s see. How\u2019s five thirty, is that good?\u201d\u201cI just remembered I\u2019m busy at five thirty.\u201d\u201cSo what time can you be there?\u201d\u201cI can do five thirty-five.\u201d\u201cDamn, that\u2019s cutting it close. I might be a little late, but wait on my ass whippin\u2019.\u201d\u201cWill you dumb asses shut up? Lord help us\u2026they\u2019ve bonded.\u201d The captain tried to suppress his laugh. \u201cGod, how the hell do you put up with Day\u2019s mouth?\u201d\u201cI got something that\u2019ll make him shut him up,\u201d God said in a deep voice.Everyone groaned and scrunched their faces up in disgust.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to hear that shit, God. Ugh,\u201d the captain said while pouring his cup of coffee.God looked at Day and saw he wasn\u2019t the slightest bit fazed and if he knew his lover\u2014which he most certainly did\u2014Day would not let him get the last word.\u201cIt\u2019s all a mind game that I play with God. He thinks he\u2019s shutting me up\u2026but when he\u2019s finished with my mouth\u2026I start talking again.\u201d Day winked.\u201cI\u2019m leaving. I should write your asses up for inappropriate conduct in front of a superior.\u201d The captain hauled ass out of the room.Johnson and Ronowski were shaking their heads too and telling Day \u201che sure knew how to clear a room.\u201d\u201cI got to get back across town,\u201d Johnson said and bent down and whispered something in Ronowski\u2019s ear that made the man turn red.God tried to pull Day away but he refused to budge. When Johnson said good-bye to them and left out the room, Day mock whispered to Ronowski. \u201cI told you. One good pounding is all you\u2014\u201d\u201cFor fucks sake, Leo,\u201d Ronowski groaned, grabbing his soda hightailing it out of there before Day could finish his sentence.": "A.E.",
  "How\u2019s it going?\u201d Day said dryly and went about setting up his coffee machine.\u201cIt\u2019s going better now that I\u2019m seeing you.\u201d Detective Johnson came over to Day and stood over him. Day had to practically reach around the tall man to start the machine. \u201cDude, want to give me a little room here.\u201d\u201cNo. I like being close to you.\u201d Detective Johnson took one long finger and slowly dragged it down the front of Day\u2019s chest.\u201cWell fuckin\u2019 unlike it.\u201d They both jumped at the sound of God\u2019s gruff voice.God walked up to Day and grabbed him by the back of his neck. He spun Day around so hard that he dropped the small packs of sugar to the floor. All he could do was hold on to God\u2019s massive biceps as he ravaged his mouth. Day let God completely control him until he was done proving his point. God released him and Day practically fell back into the counter.\u201cFuck, Cash,\u201d Day whispered, completely out of breath. After Day got his wits about him he noticed that God and Johnson were in a serious stare off over his head.Johnson broke first and looked down at Day.\u201cYou\u2019re fucking God now?\u201d Johnson asked disbelievingly.\u201cOkay, that just sounds wrong saying it like that, so I\u2019m not going to comment.\u201d Day inched away from the two giants and propped himself up on one of the break-room tables. \u201cI think I\u2019ll watch this one from the sidelines.": "A.E.",
  "God was still smiling when he went into the guest room for his suitcase. He looked in the closet and under the perfectly made bed. He even pulled out the drawers of the one armoire on the far side of the room, but couldn\u2019t find it. He was about to go back downstairs and ask Day when he turned down the long hall and walked into Day\u2019s master bedroom. His suitcase was tucked neatly in the corner. He pulled it out but immediately knew it was empty. He looked in the first dresser but those were Day\u2019s clothes. The second identical dresser was on the other side and God did a double take at his few toiletries that were neatly aligned on top. God rubbed his hand on the smooth surface and felt his heart clench at how domestic this looked.His and his dressers\u2026really.God yanked off his T-shirt and threw it in the hamper along with Day\u2019s items. He washed up quickly and went back to his dresser to put on a clean shirt. His mouth dropped when he pulled out the dresser drawer. His shirts were neatly folded and placed in an organized arrangement. God went through all five drawers. His underwear, socks, shirts, sweats, all arranged neatly and in its own place.He dropped down on the bed and thought for a minute. At first he was joking, but Day really was domesticating him. Was God ready for that? Sure he loved Day, he\u2019d take a bullet for him, but was he ready to play house? He pinched the bridge of his nose with his thumb and middle finger at the slight tension forming behind his eyes. God had been completely on his own since he was eighteen. He\u2019d never shared space with anyone\u2014hell, no one had ever wanted to.Fuck. Just last night Day was getting ready to fuck mini Justin Bieber, now he was cooking and cleaning for him and doing his damn laundry. He tried his best to shake off his anxiety. He never used the word love lightly. He meant what he\u2019d said last night. God had only loved three people his entire life and for the past four years only one of them returned that love. Should he really tuck tail and run just because this was new territory? Hell no. All he did was unpack my suitcase. No big deal. He was just being hospitable. Damn sure is better than that seedy hotel. \u201cMy boyfriend\u2019s just trying to make me comfortable.\u201d He smirked and tried the term on his tongue again. \u201cI have a boyfriend.\u201d\u201cGet your ass down here and stop overthinking shit! Dinner is getting cold!\u201d Day yelled from the bottom of the stairs.": "A.E.",
  "God came up and kissed Day on his forehead. When Day looked over at Johnson, who was still slowly sipping his soda, the guy did look lonely as hell. Before Day could say something kind, his other headache strolled in.\u201cOh hell. What the fuck is going on in here? This must be the officer\u2019s gay alliance club meeting.\u201dDay blew an exasperated breath. \u201cAnd now that you\u2019re here, Ronowski, all members are present and we can begin.\u201dDay smiled as God and Johnson practically spit their drinks out laughing.Ronowski fumed. \u201cDay, you\u2019re going to stop calling me gay! I have never been gay! I will never be gay, and I don\u2019t like anyone that is gay! So stop saying that before people start believing your bullshit!\u201dDay clapped his hands together once. \u201cOkay everyone those are the notes from last week\u2019s meeting, now on to new business.\u201d Day leveled Ronowski with a stern glare. \u201cRonowski, you are gay, man. You\u2019re tightly closeted. But you are indeed gay, ultra-gay. You\u2019re fuckin\u2019 Marvin Gay. You crash landed on Earth when your gay planet exploded.\u201d Day moved away from God and stood in front of an openmouthed Ronowski. \u201cCome out of the closet already. It\u2019s so bright and wonderful out here. Dude, I\u2019ve seen Brokeback Mountain too, don\u2019t believe that bullshit. No one cares who you fuck\u2026ya know\u2026like you tell me every. Single. Day. Of. My. Life,\u201d Day said exaggeratedly.He stepped in so close to Ronowski that he could smell the body wash he used.\u201cLet a man bang your back out one time.\u201d Day leaned in to the man\u2019s ear and felt Ronowski\u2019s body give a fierce shutter. \u201cI mean pound your ass so hard that you can\u2019t walk straight for a week, and I guarantee you, you\u2019ll want to march in the next gay pride parade, wearing nothing but a glitter jockstrap and a fuckin\u2019 hot-pink feather boa.\u201d Day stepped back and saw the beads of sweat that had popped up on Ronowski\u2019s forehead. Satisfied he\u2019d proven his point he refilled his coffee and left the break room.": "A.E.",
  "Day slammed the door behind Johnson, leaving just him and his partner in the room alone. Day hit the lights.\u201cSetting the mood, Leo?\u201d God grinned at him.\u201cI want to talk to you now.\u201d\u201cYou can\u2019t always get what you want, Leonidis,\u201d God rebutted.\u201cI want you,\u201d Day said with no hesitation.The room was deathly silent. After a few long seconds God responded simply, \u201cNo you don\u2019t.\u201d\u201cI do. Isn\u2019t it obvious?\u201d Day moved a little closer.\u201cYou don\u2019t know what the fuck you want. I\u2019ve watched you for four years, jumping from bed to bed and fucking your way through half of Atlanta. I have one emotional night and all of a sudden you want me\u2026fuck you,\u201d God said in his gruffest voice.Day\u2019s body heated instantly at the sound. He moved even closer to where God was standing on the opposite side of the table.\u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t realize I was supposed to be saving myself for marriage, and even more so, I didn\u2019t realize you were a goddamn virgin. How many women have I seen you fuck in that pussy-getting truck of yours, huh?\u201d Day lowered his voice as he stood directly in front of God. \u201cJust tell me you didn\u2019t feel what I did last night.\u201d He closed the small gap, not minding God\u2019s height at all, and looked up into electric-green eyes. \u201cTell me you don\u2019t want me too, and I\u2019ll back the fuck off.\u201dGod looked down at him and Day could see the uncertainty all over that ruggedly handsome face.\u201cShit\u2019s complicated, Leo.\u201d God\u2019s breath ghosted across his forehead.\u201cMake me understand, Cashel,\u201d Day whispered and slowly brought his hands up to rest on God\u2019s waist.": "A.E.",
  "A hot shower, and a little food might help how he felt. But he doubted anything could take away the vision he kept having of Day flying over the bed and slamming into his dresser. God squeezed his eyes shut. Fuck. I\u2019m so sorry, sweetheart.Too much happened in that room at one time. God wasn\u2019t seeing straight. Genesis was beating the hell out of him. Day had violated his trust. His hood neighbors had barged into his home and choked his baby brother. God had so much medication coursing through him, he\u2019d reacted without thinking.Now he wanted to call Day so badly, but he needed to let things cool off between them. Then he\u2019d have to figure out how he was going to make it up to him.": "A.E.",
  "What. Are. You. Doing. Here?\u201d Day snapped each word this time.\"You\u2019re not the only one that can track your lover,\u201d God said smugly while holding up his phone with the application still open.Day\u2019s mouth fell open and the shade of red he turned was priceless. He decided to get rid of their excess company and take Day back with him. God looked at Day\u2019s date and put on his best run-for-your-life face and spat menacingly. \u201cLeave. Now.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Day spoke before his date could move. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to go anywhere, Mick.\u201dGod looked back to Day and spoke in a harsh growl without moving his eyes from his partner\u2019s. \u201cMick, I say leave now. He says to stay. Whatever will you do?\u201dMick turned and ran so fast his image turned into a blur.\u201cThat takes care of that,\u201d God said.Day pushed God out of his space and turned to walk away without another word.": "A.E.",
  "Day got back into bed and fully climbed on top of him, laying his head down on his chest. God laughed. \u201cUhh, sweetheart. You going to sleep like this?\u201d\u201cYep. I\u2019ve imagined sleeping like this for years,\u201d Day said settling in comfortably.God kissed Day\u2019s forehead and wrapped his arms around him, trying to calm his mind. Please don\u2019t have a nightmare. Not tonight. Just let this night be perfect.": "A.E.",
  "Okay. Do you have something to do today?\u201d Day asked.\u201cNo. I want to go back to the hotel and change,\u201d God responded.Day thought if he should ask God about staying with him until he found another place. He didn\u2019t want to freak God out, they\u2019d just said they loved each other, but it didn\u2019t mean they were ready to pick out china. He felt God\u2019s thick fingers under his chin, pulling his face back to face him.\u201cJust ask already?\u201d God snorted a laugh.Day rolled his eyes. Sometimes he forgot how perceptive they both were. Day could pick up most of God\u2019s thoughts, just like the man could pick up his. \u201cFine.\u201d Day grumbled. \u201cDo you want to stay here with me? I\u2019m not trying to clamp a ball and chain around your ankle or anything, I just thought economically it\u2019d make more sense you know, not having to pay that kind of money for weeks when I\u2019m right here with all this extra room. Then it would be beneficial that you didn\u2019t have to travel to pick me up for work, we could split the housework too because I hate raking the leaves and you don\u2019t seem to mind. Also, I thought\u2014\u201d\u201cLeo, shut the hell up.\u201d God\u2019s eyes were wide as he stared at him.Day registered that he had rambled on, letting his nerves get the best of him while he was basically asking God to move in with him. The man was his partner but he was also so damned guarded.\u201cI could stay here with you, until I find my own place.\u201d God kissed him on the forehead and nudged him off him so he could raise up and swing his long legs over the side.": "A.E.",
  "Day climbed in first and asked. \u201cWhere\u2019s the rest of your big stuff?\u201dGod smiled. \u201cJoker brought his guys and put everything in a SWAT van and stored it in his garage. I only had like five pieces.\u201d\u201cSo he was the one you called to come to your rescue, huh?\u201d Day asked and slammed the door to the truck.\u201cHey.\u201d God turned Day\u2019s chin to face him. \u201cI swear on everything, I was miserable for those few hours and you know it.\u201dDay pffted.\u201cI tracked your ass down, didn\u2019t I?\u201d God stated.\u201cYeah, you did.\u201d Day laughed when he thought about God scaring off his boy toy. He laughed so hard that God started laughing too.": "A.E.",
  "Oh shit!\u201d Day snapped his fingers at his recollection of something very critical. Why do I always forget about this? \u201cI know exactly where he is\u2026or at least I will in a second.\u201d Day hung up without another word.He pulled up his track-your-lover app on his phone. He never did tell God how he\u2019d found him in that alley in Buckhead. It took a few seconds for the app to open fully before he saw the red dot beeping on the map of their city. You call yourself a detective, God. Pfft. He immediately called his brother back.\u201cJax, he\u2019s at the Fairfield Lodge in East Point. Please go check on him.\u201d Day didn\u2019t want to sound so pathetic. God had thrown him around and tossed him out like old luggage, but Day loved him and would never want to see God hurt or in need of help but too proud to ask for it.": "A.E.",
  "It couldn\u2019t have been that bad that he had to hurt you, Leo.\u201d\u201cOh no, it was bad. It was the fucking first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan bad, Jax.\u201d Day paced as he listened to his brother go on about God accepting responsibility for his own actions.\u201cJax, don\u2019t get me wrong, I\u2019m highly pissed off with my partner. I\u2019m pissed off to the highest of pisstivity. But I still have to know that he\u2019s okay. That crazy brother of his really landed some hard blows on him and God didn\u2019t fight back at all.\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s his baby brother. That I do get,\u201d Jax said softly. \u201cBut I can\u2019t check on him, Leo, because believe me, there is nothing here to clue me in on where he may have went.\u201d Jax paused before speaking again. \u201cI must say I\u2019m curious how he got all that heavy furniture out of here if he was in as bad a shape as you say.\u201d\u201cWell, that wouldn\u2019t be too hard to do. A lot of people owe God favors\u2014both of us actually. If God called someone for help, they\u2019d drop everything and come to help.\u201d Day took a deep breath. \u201cThe same as I would if he had called me.\u201d Day\u2019s voice was strained from the hurt in his chest and he had no doubt that Jax was picking up on it.\u201cThat asshole,\u201d Jax snapped.\u201cWhoa, big brother. Don\u2019t go cursing away your do-gooder image. You know you\u2019re not a vulgar-language type of person\u2026leave that for us heathens.\u201d Day laughed humorlessly.Day heard his brother laugh an irritated chuckle at him for trying to lighten the situation.\u201cFine. But, after he apologizes numerous times, I\u2019m going to give him a piece of my mind,\u201d Jax said.Day did smile that time. He had no doubt his brother would do just that.": "A.E.",
  "He kicked off his boots before walking through the living room. Day\u2019s house was very nice. It had been his grandmother\u2019s and she\u2019d left it for him in her will. Day made a lot of renovations on the three-bedroom, two-story home, and God found himself wishing he had a family to share that type of home with. He could see himself sitting on the large leather sofa in the den with Day snuggled up next to him. His mom baking them raisin bread and Genesis upstairs blasting his music too loud. God shook his head at the nonsense and went to find the one thing he had in his life that was real in the kitchen. Day loved him, and as far as he was concerned, that would be enough for him.": "A.E.",
  "Day had come for him. He\u2019d only missed one meeting at work and his partner\u2026his friend, had come for him. God had barely made it to the bathroom to puke after he lay in bed for hours trying to muster the strength to get up. When he fell to the floor after retching everything out of his stomach, including some of the lining, he couldn\u2019t get off the floor. He\u2019d never been so happy and so mortified at one time to see Leonidis Day.": "A.E.",
  "Are you in love with him, Leonidis?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201d Again there wasn\u2019t an ounce of hesitation, and even Day had to admit that he was shocked as shit at his confession.\u201cYou never mentioned that Cash was gay,\u201d Jax said.\u201cI know.\u201d\u201cLeo, what are you doing? Falling for a straight man, and your partner at that?\u201d His brother tried to make eye contact with him.Day finally looked into his brother\u2019s eyes, soft hazel ones that matched his own, and told him. \u201cHe loves me back. Straight, gay, bi, goddamn tranny\u2026whatever he is. That man loves me too. He just hasn\u2019t said it yet,\u201d Day took another sip, \u201cbut he will.\u201dDay was relieved his brother left that subject alone.": "A.E.",
  "It all happened within the blink of an eye. God locked Day\u2019s arms behind his back and rolled pinning him down to the mattress and baring all his weight down on him. Day\u2019s heart rate skyrocketed at the realization that God wasn\u2019t awake yet.\u201cCash, it\u2019s me! It\u2019s Leo! Wake up dammit!\u201d he shouted at God and bucked to try to free his hands that were trapped painfully behind him. His large biceps bulged and flexed with everything he had. He needed to be able to put up his guard. If God started to swing, he had to be able to block the hits.God blinked again and Day saw the reality seeping back into him. God\u2019s head jerked back and forth looking all around the dark room.\u201cCash, its Leo. Look at me. Look at me,\u201d Day said quickly.Cash turned and looked down at him and it broke his heart when God squeezed his eyes shut and let go of Day\u2019s arms. Day knew that God felt horrible, not only from the nightmare but from potentially hurting him too. Day held in his groan of pain at bringing his hands from behind his back and wrapped them protectively around God. He pulled God down to his chest.\u201cI got you, baby. It\u2019s all right, it\u2019s just a dream,\u201d Day whispered softly while stroking God everywhere that he could reach.God\u2019s heart was beating so hard Day could feel it against his own bare chest. He dug his hands in God\u2019s long hair and massaged his scalp. God squeezed him back.\u201cHe shot you. I couldn\u2019t get to you in time and he shot you,\u201d God said through ragged breaths.\u201cFuck,\u201d Day hissed and held God tight to him. \u201cNo, baby. You did get to me in time. I\u2019m right here with you. You saved me. You will always save me.\u201dDay opened his legs and let God sink in between them.\u201cDamn, I love you so fucking much,\u201d Day whispered.Day placed kisses on the side of God\u2019s face while God had his nose buried in his neck breathing him in. They lay still while both of their heart rates came back down to normal.": "A.E.",
  "They were quiet for a long time and Day felt like he could fall asleep again until God\u2019s rough voice broke into his haze.\u201cYou want to talk about it?\u201dDay took a deep breath and thought carefully about his answer. God massaged his shoulders with his strong hands and Day almost said \u201che didn\u2019t want to talk, he just wanted keep being massaged.\u201d But there was something really important he needed to say.\u201cCash. Thank you for yesterday.\u201d Day spun around in God\u2019s arms and faced him. \u201cI\u2019ve never been that scared in my life. At first I felt that if I died now, then it\u2019s okay, because I died while I was in love and I died staring into your eyes. But when you said what you said.\u201d Day placed his palm over God\u2019s heart and felt the rapid beat there and he closed his eyes. \u201cYou said you\u2019d have no soul, no conscience, and you\u2019d take your revenge. That\u2019s when I got scared.\u201dGod cast his eyes down.\u201cYou have to promise me. If anything ever happens to me that you\u2019d go on. That\u2019s the only way I\u2019d die in peace. You\u2019d live for me. That you\u2019d mourn me and then go on and love again. You\u2019ve come so far in your life. The things you\u2019ve endured and been through made you strong. Some men have gone through less and it drove them to do unthinkable things because they couldn\u2019t handle the hand life dealt them. But you lived through it and now you\u2019re a highly respected detective.\u201d Day gripped God\u2019s chin and lifted his head. He kissed him passionately. \u201cAnd you\u2019re the man I love.\u201dDay didn\u2019t need God to answer him in words, his eyes and his kiss said it all. He told Day that he\u2019d live for him.": "A.E.",
  "Wouldn\u2019t I be sick too, or people in the office,\u201d Day argued.\u201cNot really. If an adult does start to cough or get a sore throat, they most likely go to their doctor and get medicine or an antibiotic, and the symptoms go away. I will give you a couple of doses of antibiotics just in case, since you two are obviously,\u201d his brother paused and looked at him, \u201cclose.\u201d\u201cThanks, Jax,\u201d Day said, ignoring his brother\u2019s insinuation. \u201cSo he\u2019s going to be fine?": "A.E.",
  "So are you going to tell me why Ronowski pulled you into the break room when we got back today?\u201d God asked watching Day closely.Day shook his head at him, smiling wickedly. \u201cIt was about sex.\u201d\u201cNo fucking way. He came to you about sex?\u201d God said, not hiding his shock.\u201cWho else is he going to ask\u2026his priest?\u201d Day said and quickly dodged the piece of garlic bread God threw at his head.\u201cDo I want to know?\u201d God said.\u201cIt wasn\u2019t too bad. He wanted to know the best way to pleasure Johnson.\u201d Day laughed when God balled up his face and made a gagging sound.\u201cThere intimacy has been pretty one-sided from what I could understand. Ro was still pretty shy about telling me stuff, so I was mostly guessing.\u201d Day wiped his mouth with his napkin before continuing. \u201cBeing the stud that I am\u2026I gave the kid a few pointers.\u201d\u201cStud, huh?\u201d God smiled.\u201cYeah. I don\u2019t mind taking the little tike under my homosexual wing and showing him how to fly.\u201d Day grinned.\u201cYou\u2019re twisted. And isn\u2019t Ro like the same age as you,\u201d God said.Day blew an exasperated breath. \u201cRegardless of age, Cash. I have more experience. Way more. Way, way, way more experience with fucking men than anyone I\u2014\u201d\u201cI fucking got it, Leo.\u201d God scowled at him.Day laughed hysterically. \u201cI told him all about how I make you scream my name every night.\u201d Day chuckled and bolted up from his chair when God took off after him. Day ran back into the kitchen, jumping and gliding across the kitchen island on his hip and racing into the den. God was hot on his heels.\u201cI\u2019ll catch you, you quick little bastard. And when I do, I\u2019m going to show you just how loud I can make you scream,\u201d God said in his sexy rough-hewn voice.\u201cOh fuck.\u201dDay was laughing so hard he could barely just keep out of God\u2019s grip. He dodged him in the living room, leaping over the coffee table heading fast toward the stairs when he was caught around his waist with a strong arm and dragged back down the two steps he\u2019d cleared.": "A.E.",
  "Have dinner with me tonight?\u201d Day asked his voice full of emotion.\u201cYes,\u201d God answered immediately.": "A.E.",
  "Day\u2019s thoughts were interrupted when Detective Johnson strolled into the conference room and announced proudly, \u201cDetective Day, you are going to love me, handsome.\u201d\u201cOh yeah, you finally got me that date with Channing Tatum?\u201d Day quipped.Day heard God huff with annoyance, not bothering to turn around and face them.": "A.E.",
  "time flies so fast. day by day left us. with or without smiles, the new days will comes.": "Nunki",
  "This fucking city is full of nothing but thugs, money grubbing porn-bitches, and hustlers. I\u2019m calling the police.\u201d Ex fumed as he struggled to pull his cell from his pocket.If Syn weren't so damn angry it would\u2019ve been funny as shit the way the man\u2019s jaw dropped when God and Day both pulled their gold badges out from under their shirts. Day smiled that sinister grin and kneeled in front of them, speaking in an official tone, \u201c911, what is your emergency?": "A.E.",
  "Syn pulled his boxers on and quietly left the bedroom, walking angrily to the kitchen. He turned the corner and wanted to throw a shit-fit at the sight before him. Day was standing at his stove loading some type of egg dish onto a plate before turning and setting it in front of God. God folded down one side of his newspaper, peering at Syn from behind it.\u201cWell good morning, sunshine,\u201d Day said way too cheerily for five-fucking-a.m. \u201cWe brought breakfast.\u201dSyn clenched his jaw, trying not to yell at his superior officers. \u201cHave you two lost your fuckin\u2019 minds? Come on. It\u2019s, it\u2019s ... early.\u201d Syn turned his wrist, forgetting he didn\u2019t have his watch on yet. \u201cDamn, you guys are always at the office, or at a crime scene, or over fucking here at god-awful hours.\u201d\u201cOh, it\u2019s early?\u201d Day said disbelievingly. God shrugged like he hadn\u2019t realized either.\u201cSeriously. When the fuck do you guys sleep?\u201d\u201cNever,\u201d God said nonchalantly.\u201cWhen do you fuck?\u201d Syn snapped.\u201cAlways,\u201d Day quipped. \u201cJust did thirty minutes ago. Nice couch by the way, real comfy, sorry for the stain.\u201d Syn tiredly flipped Day off.\u201cDon\u2019t be pissed,\u201d Day sing-songed. \u201cA dab of Shout will get that right out.\u201dSyn rubbed angrily at his tired eyes, growling, \u201cDay.\u201d\u201cHe\u2019s not in a joking mood, sweetheart,\u201d God said from behind his paper. \u201cYou know we didn\u2019t fuck on your couch so calm the hell down. Damn you\u2019re moody in the morning. Unless ... We weren\u2019t interrupting anything, were we? So, how\u2019s porn boy?\u201d God\u2019s gruff voice filled the kitchen, making Syn cringe.\u201cFirst of all. Don\u2019t fucking call him that, ever, and damnit God. Lower your voice. Shit. He\u2019s still asleep,\u201d Syn berated his Lieutenant, who didn\u2019t look the slightest bit fazed by Syn\u2019s irritation. \u201cYou guys could let him sleep, he\u2019s had a rough night, ya know.\u201dDay leaned his chest against God\u2019s large back, draping his arms over his shoulders. \u201cOh damn, what kind of friends are we? It was rough, huh?\u201d Day looked apologetic.\u201cYes, it was, Day. He just\u2013\u201d\u201cTry water-based lube next time,\u201d Day interrupted, causing God to choke on his eggs.\u201cDay, fuck.\u201d Syn tried not to grin, but when he thought about it, it really was funny.\u201cI knew I\u2019d get you to smile. Have some breakfast Sarge, we gotta go question the crazy chicks. You know how much people feel like sharing when they\u2019ve spent a night in jail.\u201d\u201cDamn. Alright, just let me\u2013\u201d\u201cWow. Something smells great.\u201d Furi\u2019s deep voice reached them from down the hall as he made his way to the kitchen. \u201cYou cook babe? Who knew? I\u2019ll have the Gladiator portion.\u201d Furi used his best Roman accent as he sauntered into the kitchen with his hands on hips and his head high.Syn turned just as Furi noticed God and Day.\u201cOh, fuck, shit, Jesus Christ!\u201d Furi stumbled, his eyes darting wildly between all of them. \u201cDamn, I\u2019m so sorry.\u201d Furi looked at Syn trying to gauge exactly how much he\u2019d fucked up just now.Syn smiled at him and Furi immediately lost the horrified expression. Syn held his hand out and mouthed to him 'it's okay.": "A.E.",
  "Where does that door lead to?\u201d Day pointed at a door which opened out onto the dark alley.\u201cI looked it up. It appears to be a small film studio,\u201d the other officer finally stopped staring at God long enough to add to the conversation. \u201cPorn films.\u201dDay looked up in amusement. \u201cShut the fuck up.\u201dThe two cops nodded. \u201cThat\u2019s what we pulled up in the system. We went around to the front. It\u2019s locked and no one\u2019s inside. We called the number registered to the address, but got no answer.\u201d\u201cWho\u2019s the owner of the company?\u201d God asked.The officer flipped a couple pages on his notebook. \u201cIllustra is owned by Johnathan Mack. We also have a list of all the performers and staff.\u201dDay looked at God. \u201cI bet that little vixen we just apprehended has a recurring role here. Wonder what made her so mad that she wanted to kill someone as soon as she finished fucking.\u201d\u201cMaybe she didn\u2019t get to come.\u201d Ronowski chuckled, joined by several of the team members.Syn grimaced.\u201cYeah, that might make you homicidal alright,\u201d Day added. \u201cBut I wouldn\u2019t know.\u201d\u201cDay, shut the fuck up,\u201d God barked at his lover's usual inappropriateness. It seemed Day had never met a boundary he didn't stomp right over.": "A.E.",
  "Yep. We\u2019re his Lieutenants,\u201d Day answered, picking up the largest coffee cup Furi had ever seen and taking a huge gulp. \u201cYou guys had a trying evening last night, so we thought we\u2019d check in on you.\u201dSyn just nodded. \u201cHmm. Right.\u201d\u201cNice bandage.\u201d God peeked around his paper again angling his head at Syn\u2019s hand. \u201cNothing broken?\u201dSyn looked at his hand. \u201cFuri wrapped it up for me last night. Just a little torn skin, it\u2019s nothing really.\u201d\u201cHe tried to be all tough but I had to blow on it to make it feel better.\u201d Furi\u2019s teasing had Syn smiling.\u201cGlad you\u2019re okay, Syn.\u201d Day winked mischievously.Furi looked at Syn. \u201cYou just don\u2019t realize how awesome it is to have such great bosses. Came to check up on you, considerate enough to bring you breakfast, I mean just all around awesome guys.\u201d\u201cJust wait for it, Furi,\u201d Syn cut him off.\u201cWhat?\u201d Furi\u2019s brow creased in confusion.\u201cAll the warm compliments you\u2019re giving God and Day ... just wait for it.\u201dFuri looked confused. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re\u2013\u201d\u201cWhat else did you have to blow on to make feel better?\u201d Day said around a snort. \u201cReally hate to have missed that show, spanky.\u201d Day smiled broadly at Furi.Furi groaned and dropped his head as he ran both hands through his hair. \u201cYou guys watched my videos.\u201d\u201cHell yeah.\u201d Day grinned.\u201cFor evidence and research purposes only,\u201d God chimed in.\u201cFive times,\u201d Day yelled, punching God in his large bicep.\u201cOkay guys. Shut up,\" Syn huffed.\u201cI\u2019m just saying, you lucky fuck. You get to date a hot porn puppy and we can\u2019t say anything.\u201d Day stared at Furi, completely ignoring Syn\u2019s fuming.": "A.E.",
  "It's a new minute, a new hour and a new day cherish it !!!!!!!": "Bonnie",
  "Syn pulled Furi to his chest. \u201cFuri, I want you to go back through the bar and go wait at my place. I\u2019m going to have a little chat with your ex-husband,\u201d Syn said extra loudly.Furi huffed in annoyance, \u201cSyn, I took six months of self-defense courses at the YMCA this year. I can fight for myself.\u201dSyn looked at Furi like he\u2019d lost his damn mind. \u201cAt the Y? Well hell, that\u2019s great Furious. If you ever get jumped by the Village People, feel free to pull out those moves. As for now, I want you to take your karate-kicking-YMCA-going-ass back to my apartment,\u201d Syn snarled at Furi, urging him toward the door, having neither the time nor the patience to argue with his ridiculous pride. Thankfully, with one final glare Furi went back into the pub. When Syn turned back, God and Day were looking back and forth between him and his two foes.\u201cWhat\u2019s going on here, fellas?\u201d God asked casually, not acknowledging Syn.": "A.E.",
  "Syn watched Day look around at his lack of furniture ... or pictures ... or art ... or decorations ... or any other amenities that made a house a home. \u201cOh good. It looks like we didn\u2019t miss the housewarming party. Are you registered?": "A.E.",
  "Syn tightened his seat belt as God drove like a damn lunatic through the city. He was now on the interstate doing over a hundred miles an hour.\u201cIf the person\u2019s already dead, what\u2019s the damn rush, Cash?\u201d Day grumbled, obviously not liking God\u2019s driving either.God ignored his passengers and swerved over four lanes, cutting off an eighteen-wheeler and just missing the barrier as he took the exit ramp at seventy.\u201cGot a real heavy foot there, don\u2019t you Lieutenant?\u201d Syn gritted through clenched teeth.God let out a grunt as sharp green eyes caught Syn\u2019s reflection in the rearview mirror.Please just watch the fucking road.": "A.E.",
  "Our probie kicked the door in before we gave the okay. We don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to make it on the task force, Cap. He\u2019s too much of a hot-head.\u201dOh, fuck that. There was no way that they were going to pin this on him. Syn growled and took several determined steps toward Day before God was there, blocking his path.\u201cYou might want to think about your next move very carefully. Especially if it involves touching him.\u201d God\u2019s voice lowered to a frightening timbre.": "A.E.",
  "You cannot study the same day of a test, and expect to do your very best.": "Charmaine",
  "Once they were gone, Syn lifted his head to look at his Lieutenants. He knew how close he\u2019d been to putting a bullet in that bastard\u2019s head, because all he kept picturing were that man\u2019s hands wrapped around Furi\u2019s throat. Syn hadn\u2019t lost control in a long time, and he wondered what that meant. How deep did his feelings for Furi run?\u201cGo home,\u201d Day said, clasping him on the shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll handle the rogue bitch clan at the station.\u201d\u201cI can do my job, Day,\u201d Syn snapped back at his boss.\u201cWe know that. We\u2019ll let Sasha Pain; aka porn bitch sit on ice and interrogate her in the morning see if there\u2019s any connection with this ex-husband and BTNS.\u201d God gestured with his head. \u201cGo check on your man, you know that\u2019s where you want to be.\u201dSyn was taken aback. God said nothing about him dating a prior suspect in a case they were still working, or about dragging them into a back alley fight while he took his revenge. God was actually being compassionate. Well, damn. Syn was astonished to see that side of him.\u201cBesides, you won\u2019t be worth shit to me with a hard on all night.\u201dAnd he\u2019s back. Well, that compassion sure was short-lived.": "A.E.",
  "Furi walked across Syn\u2019s living room carpet for what felt like the millionth time while he waited for him to come back. How dare he order me to leave? Like I\u2019m a damn kid. Furi decided right then and there that he was going to have a talk with Syn. Furi wouldn\u2019t be his kept man or his bitch.Furi stopped mid-stride when he heard the door open and close behind Syn. All the anger and hostility he\u2019d felt while alone in Syn\u2019s place just disappeared when the ruggedly handsome man yanked his dark coat off and threw it on the couch, approaching Furi with a hungry look.\u201cDid he hurt you?\u201d Syn\u2019s voice was gravelly. He put both hands on either side of Furi\u2019s neck and lifted it gently, eyeing the slight redness there.\u201cI\u2019m fine. Despite the fact you keep having to rescue me, I\u2019m not a weakling. I can defend myself,\u201d Furi said with venom, pulling away from Syn\u2019s examination.\u201cRight. That Mr. Miyagi crash course at the Y.\u201d Syn stifled a laugh, but Furi thought it was anything but funny and he let Syn know it.\u201cDon\u2019t fucking mock me.\u201d Furi stormed past him down the hall. Syn\u2019s footsteps sounded behind him. He\u2019d just caught up with him when he opened the bathroom door.\u201cHey, hey, hey,\u201d Syn said in a whisper. \u201cI\u2019m sorry. I wasn\u2019t mocking you, I was teasing you.\u201dFuri frowned and Syn shook his head. \u201cLet me clarify. Joking after an intensely stressful situation helps to calm me. I need to come down from the high of an adrenaline rush, that\u2019s all that was.": "A.E.",
  "Syn stared into Furi\u2019s sparkling eyes. He brought one hand up and tenderly brushed Furi\u2019s cheek. \u201cCongratulations.\u201d\u201cThank you.\u201d Furi kissed his lips gently. \u201cI\u2019ll be fine. I\u2019m a big boy.\u201d\u201cI know you are.\u201d Syn winked.Furi flushed with embarrassment. \u201cShut up. Don\u2019t start something you can\u2019t finish.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll finish it later,\u201d Syn promised. His look was pure lust as he pushed his rising cock against Furi\u2019s jean-clad thigh.\u201cFuckin\u2019 right you will,\u201d Furi moaned against Syn\u2019s cheek, rocking back against him. \u201cI\u2019d fuckin\u2019 take you right now if your bosses weren\u2019t in the front room.\u201dSyn groaned.Furi gripped Syn\u2019s cock in a firm grip and stroked a couple times, wrapping his other arm around Syn\u2019s back to hold him close. He nipped at Syn\u2019s stubbled chin, peppering sweet kisses along his jaw to his ear. Furi flicked his tongue out and pulled the fleshy lobe between his soft lips. Furi\u2019s lips were pressed against his ear as he spoke in a low, sexy drawl, \u201cI\u2019d bend you over this sink and fuck you until you yelled my name and begged me not to stop.\u201d\u201cFuck,\u201d Syn moaned. Heat tore up through him at Furi\u2019s nasty words.\u201cFuck you hard, just how you like it, baby.\u201d Furi increased the speed of his stroke.\u201cOh fuck, fuck. No. Stop honey,\u201d Syn protested weakly, his balls already throbbing with the need for release.\u201cWhy?\u201d Furi hissed.\u201cBecause I fucking refuse to let Day hear me come.\u201d Syn put some room between their bodies and kept backing up until he hit the wall. He tried to control his breathing, but staring at Furi\u2019s gorgeous, flushed face didn\u2019t help.\u201cYou guys are crazy.\u201d Furi shook his head.\u201cDay\u2019s pranks have no boundaries. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if my moans are broadcasted over the loudspeaker in the office today.\u201d Syn opened the bathroom door and gestured for Furi to look out into the hallway. \u201cSee.\u201dFuri busted out laughing at Day standing there in the hallway with his cell phone in his hand, studying the non-existent art on Syn\u2019s bare wall. He whistled like he was just lounging around not looking for trouble. Syn just flipped him off and pulled Furi into his bedroom, slamming the door behind them.\u201cOh my fucking god. That shit is too funny.\u201d Furi laughed while he put a few things into his backpack.\u201cYeah, because you don\u2019t\u2019 have to deal with his silliness.\u201d Syn hurried to get dressed.": "A.E.",
  "Fuck,\u201d Syn growled. He was still thinking of solutions when he heard something scrape against his doorknob. Something metal was tampering with the lock. If he were anywhere else in the apartment he wouldn\u2019t have heard it, but he was right next to the door, so he could hear someone trying to get in. He instinctually moved to stand in front of Furi, pulling his Sig from its holster and unlocking the safety. He felt Furi tensing behind him.He could hear the tool manipulating the lock mechanism. Is this bastard really fuckin\u2019 brave enough to break into my home in broad goddamn daylight? Syn was in awe at the size of this guy\u2019s balls. The closet door was arm's length away. He yanked it open and grabbed the blanket off the top shelf, pulling his loaded twelve-gauge shotgun down just as the door eased open. All Syn could see was the tip of a black boot. Furi griped his shoulder. \u201cHey. Listen to this!\u201d Syn yelled out. He put the stock of the gun firmly against his shoulder and pulled the pump back in two extremely swift moves. The sound was extremely loud and intimidating in the quiet room, by far the scariest sound an intruder could hear.\u201cDon\u2019t shoot, Dirty Harry.\u201d The irritating chuckle that followed was unmistakable.\u201cSon of a bitch,\u201d Syn grumbled. \u201cDay, have you lost your fuckin\u2019 mind?\u201dHis Lieutenants came all the way through the door, Day laughing at the pissed look on Syn's face and Furi leaning on the wall behind him recovering from a panic attack. \u201cSyn. What the hell is going on man? Are you really gonna put a buckshot in someone you think is breakin\u2019 into your little-ass apartment? Because, you do know that that\u2019s excessive force, right?\u201d God asked, looking at him expectantly.\u201cI was just scaring them off. No one comes in after hearing that sound, trust me.\u201d Syn removed the shell and placed the gun back in the closet, covering it with the blanket. He turned to look at Furi. He looked a little pale but he was okay.Syn spun back around, \u201cDay. Knock on my damn door like a normal visitor and wait for me to say come in!\u201dDay pfftd, plopping down on the couch. \u201cYou don\u2019t invite the wind. The wind just\u2013\u201d\u201cStop saying that stupid wind bullshit. Because if your door is shut and you weather guard that bitch then the wind stays the fuck out until ... You. Open. The. Door.\u201d Syn\u2019s dark eyes bored into Day\u2019s hazel ones.God\u2019s laugh was raspy, while Day looked bewildered. \u201cBut we\u2019re family.\u201d\u201cOh for fuck\u2019s sake,\u201d Syn grumbled, he had to get going; he had no time to explain to Day about how to behave in civilized society. He turned serious eyes back on Furi. \u201cI gotta go, but I really think\u2013\u201dFuri pulled Syn to him before he could finish the sentence, kissed him hard on the mouth before turning, heading to the bedroom. \u201cJust concentrate on your job and don\u2019t take any officers away from their assignments to follow me. There could be someone out there who really needs their help.\u201dSyn didn\u2019t get to say anything else because Furi had closed the bedroom door. End of discussion.": "A.E.",

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, there was little love lost between Imperial troops and the locals who viewed each other with little short of open hostility, and often through the sighting devices attached to weaponry of various diverse descriptions.": "Christina",
  "Syn had to take his hand off Furi\u2019s thigh so he could answer his cell phone. He saw it was Day and put it on speakerphone.\u201cYeah, Day. What\u2019s the word?\u201d Syn greeted, cutting right to chase on the decision of Furi\u2019s protective order.\u201cIt\u2019s done and I had Ruxs and Green serve it this afternoon.\u201d Day\u2019s grin could be heard through the phone.Syn and Furi turned and smiled at each other, remembering how intimidating those two detectives looked. There was no way Patrick and Brenden would want to go up against them. They were the muscle of the taskforce so Syn could only imagine how they served that order. Surely Furi\u2019s ex was on the first thing smoking back to Charlotte.\u201cAsk Furi if he's gotten any phone calls from asshat today.\u201d\u201cWait how\u2019d you know he was even with me?\u201d Syn glanced a look at the phone.Day pfftd. \u201cYeah right, just ask him.\u201dFuri spoke up, his deep voice filling the small space of Syn\u2019s truck. \u201cNo I haven\u2019t. Thank you very much Day, I really appreciate your help man.\u201dDay\u2019s voice dropped a couple octaves and rumbled back through the speaker. \u201cCall me Leo, darlin. And just how appreciative are you willing to be, Furious?\u201dClick.Syn disconnected the call and tossed the phone into the console. Furi laughed so hard he had tears coming down his cheeks.": "A.E.",
  "God could no longer see the faces of the men, only red and orange hazes. He heard taunting voices in his mind spurring him on, calling him a \u201cpussy,\u201d and old, hairy hands reaching out to grab him. His gripped tightened on the punk\u2019s neck and he cocked his right arm back ready to do some serious damage.\u201cLet him go.\u201dGod shook his head at the familiar deep voice.\u201cI said, let him go now!\u201dHe felt two strong hands land on his shoulders and heat seeped its way into him from behind.\u201cPut him down, God. Right now before you kill him. Listen to my voice.\u201d Day was up on his tiptoes speaking into his ear. His breath was hot on his neck and it gave him a tingling in his spine. \u201cCashel, stop,\u201d Day whispered.God put his right arm down and released the man from his grip. He didn\u2019t wait to see the man\u2019s body drop. He spun around and looked into his friend\u2019s eyes, and was relieved when he didn\u2019t see judgment, sorrow, or pity\u2026all he saw was relief and then concern. Day grabbed him and held on to him tightly. His embrace was strong and confident\u2026exactly what God needed to feel right then.\u201cCome on, we gotta get out of here.\u201d Day gripped the back of his arm and moved them quickly out of the alley and into a waiting taxi.\u201cWait\u2026my truck.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s taken care of.\u201d Day kept him from getting out of the vehicle.\u201cWhat do you mean?\u201d\u201cI mean you owe me two hundred dollars because that\u2019s what I just paid the bartender to follow us back to my place in your truck.\u201dGod spun around and saw his huge truck\u2019s headlights behind them.\u201cYou have a stranger driving my truck\u2026my fucking guns are in there, Leo.\u201d\u201cYou should\u2019ve thought about that earlier, Cash,\u201d Day growled right back.\u201cIf you\u2019re going to lecture me, Leo\u2026fucking save it.\u201d God slid down farther and let his aching head rest on the back of the seat as the cab accelerated onto the highway.\u201cYou know me better than that, Cash. I\u2019m not going to lecture you. I\u2019m going to kick your ass,\u201d Day said matter-of-factly and turned to look out the window. Neither one said anything else the rest of the ride.": "A.E.",

The next hour dragged by, in about the same way as the hour before that. At twelve twenty-five, Commander Ortez found himself stepping out of an elevator into an equally mundane grey steel corridor on his way to the mess hall. Turning a corner, he met with a stream of crewmen milling around between shifts. Some off-duty personnel were lounging around in civvies, which consisted mostly of re-revamped 60's hippy fashions. Of all the places on the ship, the mess was the most spacious, (i.e.: it was a big mess.) The command officer\u2019s balcony overhung the rest of the crew dining area. Ortez sat at his usual place, wincing as he remembered to get someone to fix the springs in his chair. An ensign, 3rd class dressed in chef\u2019s white, served him with a plate of what either ended up feeding the chefs latest pet - or strangling it. Marnetti, Barnum and the sciences officer Commander Jaris Skotchdopole filed in, not necessarily in that order, and found seats.

Perhaps in German too, although I can't be sure: el enamoramiento--the state of falling or being in love, or perhaps infatuation. I'm referring to the noun, the concept; the adjective, the condition, are admittedly more familiar, at least in French, although not in English, but there are words that approximate that meaning ... We find a lot of people funny, people who amuse and charm us and inspire affection and even tenderness, or who please us, captivate us, and can even make us momentarily mad, we enjoy their body and their company or both those things, as is the case for me with you and as I've experienced before with other women, on other occasions, although only a few. Some become essential to us, the force of habit is very strong and ends up replacing or even supplanting almost everything else. It can supplant love, for example, but not that state of being in love, it's important to distinguish between the two things, they're easily confused, but they're not the same ...

  "To listen is very hard, because it asks of us so much interior stability that we no longer need to prove ourselves by speeches, arguments, statements, or declarations. True listeners no longer have an inner need to make their presence known. They are free to receive, to welcome, to accept.Listening is much more than allowing another to talk while waiting for a chance to respond. Listening is paying full attention to others and welcoming them into our very beings. The beauty of listening is that, those who are listened to start feeling accepted, start taking their words more seriously and discovering their own true selves. Listening is a form of spiritual hospitality by which you invite strangers to become friends, to get to know their inner selves more fully, and even to dare to be silent with you.": "Henri",

And if I may suggest it, you should listen in that way to everything \u2013 not only to what I am saying, but also to what other people are saying; to the birds, to the whistle of a locomotive, to the noise of the bus gong by. You will find that the more you listen to everything, the greater is the silence, and that silence is then not broken by noise.

  "Sometimes all that\u2019s needed to heal a wounded soul and lift a sagging spirit is one loving listener, for at its core, listening is love\u2013love that sacrifices its need to be heard in favor of hearing, a desire to lecture in favor of learning, an opportunity to show off in favor of showing compassion.

Funny, because the root of the word obey is from the French verb meaning \u201cto listen, or to give ear to.\u201d It was never intended as a militant word, but one of hearing, of understanding.

  "I went back every evening, after work, for nearly a year. I learned the meaning of the cud of a leaf and the glisten of wet pebbles, and the special significance of curves and angles. A great deal of the writing was unwritten. Plot three dots on a graph and join them; you now have a curve with certain characteristics. Extend that curve while maintaining the characteristics, and it has meaning, up where no dots were plotted.In just this way I learned to extend the curve of a grass-blade and of a protruding root, of the bent edges of wetness on a drying headstone. I quit smoking so I could sharpen my sense of smell, because the scent of earth after a rain has a clarifying effect on graveyard reading, as if the page were made whiter and the ink darker.

  "All love stories are frustration stories. As are all stories about parents and children, which are also love stories, in Freud's view, the formative love stories. To fall in love is to be reminded of a frustration that you didn't know you had (of one's formative frustrations, and of one's attempted self-cures for them); you wanted someone, you felt deprived of something, and then it seems to be there. And what is renewed in that experience is an intensity of frustration, and an intensity of satisfaction. It is as if, oddly, you were waiting for someone but you didn't know who they were until they arrived. Whether or not you were aware that there was something missing in your life, you will be when you meet the person you want. What psychoanalysis will add to this love story is that the person you fall in love with really is the man or woman of your dreams; that you have dreamed them up before you met them; not out of nothing - nothing comes of nothing - but out of prior experience, both real and wished for. You recognize them with such certainty because you already, in a certain sense, know them, and because you have quite literally been expecting them, you feel as though you have known them for ever, and yet, at the same time, they are quite foreign to you. They are familiar foreign bodies. But one things is very noticeable in this basic story; that however much you have been wanting and hoping and dreaming of meeting the person of your dreams, it is only when you meet them that you will start missing them. It seems the presence of an object is required to make its absence felt.": "Adam",

As for us, it is the unconditional acceptance of all people, the scale of our love for them. Let's treat every person as a person in his uniqueness at eye level.Love is one of the strongest feelings one can ever have. It comes over you all of a sudden and totally absorbs before you manage to realize the fact. Emotions which arise with the feeling require some way of expression.

  "Falling in love is not an act of will. It is not a conscious choice. No matter how open to or eager for it we may be, the experience may still elude us. Contrarily, the experience may capture us at times when we are definitely not seeking it, when it is inconvenient and undesirable. We are as likely to fall in love with someone with whom we are obviously ill matched as with someone more suitable. Indeed, we may not even like or admire the object of our passion, yet, try as we might, we may not be able to fall in love with a person whom we deeply respect and with whom a deep relationship would be in all ways desirable. This is not to say that the experience of falling in love is immune to discipline. Psychiatrists, for instance, frequently fall in love with their patients, just as their patients fall in love with them, yet out of duty to the patient and their role they are usually able to abort the collapse of their ego boundaries and give up the patient as a romantic object. The struggle and suffering of the discipline involved may be enormous. But discipline and will can only control the experience; they cannot create it. We can choose how to respond to the experience of falling in love, but we cannot choose the experience itself.": "M.",
  "Of all the misconceptions about love the most powerful and pervasive is the belief that \"falling in love\" is love or at least one of the manifestations of love. It is a potent misconception, because falling in love is subjectively experienced in a very powerful fashion as an experience of love. When a person falls in love what he or she certainly feels is \"I love him\" or \"I love her.\" But two problems are immediately apparent. The first is that the experience of falling in love is specifically a sex-linked erotic experience. We do not fall in love with our children even though we may love them very deeply. We do not fall in love with our friends of the same sex-unless we are homosexually oriented-even though we may care for them greatly. We fall in love only when we are consciously or unconsciously sexually motivated. The second problem is that the experience of falling in love is invariably temporary. No matter whom we fall in love with, we sooner or later fall out of love if the relationship continues long enough. This is not to say that we invariably cease loving the person with whom we fell in love. But it is to say that the feeling of ecstatic lovingness that characterizes the experience of falling in love always passes. The honeymoon always ends. The bloom of romance always fades.": "M.",
  "I think you could fall in love with anyone if you saw the parts of them that no one else gets to see. I don't know, like if you followed them around invisibly for a day and you saw them crying in their bed at night or singing to themselves as they make a sandwich or even just walking along the street and even if they were really weird and had no friends at school, I think after seeing them at their most vulnerable you wouldn't be able to help falling in love with them.": "tumblr",
  "I could fall in love with Dallas Winston,\" she said. \"I hope I never see himagain, or I will.": "S.E.",
  "If falling in love is not love, then what is it other than a temporary and partial collapse of ego boundaries? I do not know. But the sexual specificity of the phenomenon leads me to suspect that it is a genetically determined instinctual component of mating behavior. In other words, the temporary collapse of ego boundaries that constitutes falling in love is a stereotypic response of human beings to a configuration of internal sexual drives and external sexual stimuli, which serves to increase the probability of sexual pairing and bonding so as to enhance the survival of the species. Or to put it in another, rather crass way, falling in love is a trick that our genes pull on our otherwise perceptive mind to hoodwink or trap us into marriage. Frequently the trick goes awry one way or another, as when the sexual drives and stimuli are homosexual or when other forces-parental interference, mental illness, conflicting responsibilities or mature self-disciplinesupervene to prevent the bonding. On the other hand, without this trick, this illusory and inevitably temporary (it would not be practical were it not temporary) regression to infantile merging and omnipotence, many of us who are happily or unhappily married today would have retreated in whole- hearted terror from the realism of the marriage vows.": "M.",

She is not sure what he's said to his girlfriend to wangle a night away and she doesn't want to know. She would hate it if it was done to her - she has never seen herself as the kind of girl who would steal another woman's man. She and Anna have always been most disapproving about women who do that, arguing through college and beyond that there are plenty of available men out there, that it is quite unnecessary to go for those already spoken for. But she has liked Simon since day one, and he is the one who initiated this whole thing. He is the one who blew her away with a clandestine kiss just a week ago, who asked if he could come back and stay at hers afterwards; he is the one who doubtless made unconvincing excuses when he returned home the next day.

I must become a brilliant cook, I don\u2019t want to waste time seeing my friends when I could be with him, I feel no sympathy for all those people in India killed by an earthquake last night; what is the matter with me? It\u2019s a kind of hell, but you feel like your in heaven.even your body goes out of control, you can\u2019t eat, you don\u2019t sleep properly, your legs turn to jelly as your not sure where the floor is anymore. you have butterflies permanently, not only in your tummy but all over your body - your hands, your shoulders, your chest, your eyes everything\u2019s just a jangling mess of nerve endings tingling with fire. it makes you feel so alive. and yet its like being suffocated, you don\u2019t seem to be able to see or hear anything real anymore, its like people are speaking to you through treacle, and so you stay in your cosy place with him, the place that only you two understand. occasionally your forced to come up for air by your biggest enemy, Real Life, so you do the minimum then head back down under your love blanket for more, knowing it\u2019s uncomfortable but compulsory.and then, once you think you\u2019ve got him, the panic sets in. what if he goes off me? what if I blow it, say the wrong thing? what if he meets someone better than me? Prettier, thinner, funnier, more like him? who doesn\u2019t bite there nails? perhaps he doesn\u2019t feel the same, maybe this is all in my head and this is just a quick fling for him. why did I tell him that stupid story about not owning up that I knew who spilt the ink on the teachers bag and so everyone was punished for it? does he think I'm a liar? what if I'm not very good at that blow job thing and he\u2019s just being patient with me? he says he loves me; yes, well, we can all say words, can\u2019t we? perhaps he\u2019s just being polite.of course you do your best to keep all this to yourself, you don\u2019t want him to think you're a neurotic nutcase, but now when he\u2019s away doing Real Life it\u2019s agony, your mind won\u2019t leave you alone, it tortures you and examines your every moment spent together, pointing out how stupid you\u2019ve been to allow yourself to get this carried away, how insane you are to imagine someone would feel like that about you. dad did his best to reassure me, but nothing he said made a difference - it was like I wanted to see Simon, but didn\u2019t want him to see me.": "Annabel",

  "I thought you were dead,\u201d I say. \u201cIt almost killed me.\u201d\u201cDid it?\u201d His voice is neutral. \u201cYou made a pretty fast recovery.\u201d\u201cNo. You don\u2019t understand.\u201d My throat is tight; I feel as though I\u2019m being strangled. \u201cI couldn\u2019t keep hoping, and then waking up every day and finding out it wasn\u2019t true, and you were still gone. I\u2014I wasn\u2019t strong enough.\u201dHe is quiet for a second. It\u2019s too dark to see his expression: He is standing in shadow again, but I can sense that he is staring at me.Finally he says, \u201cWhen they took me to the Crypts, I thought they were going to kill me. They didn\u2019t even bother. They just left me to die. They threw me in a cell and locked the door.\u201d\u201cAlex.\u201d The strangled feeling has moved from my throat to my chest, and without realizing it, I have begun to cry. I move toward him. I want to run my hands through his hair and kiss his forehead and each of his eyelids and take away the memory of what he has seen. But he steps backward, out of reach.\u201cI didn\u2019t die. I don\u2019t know how. I should have. I\u2019d lost plenty of blood. They were just as surprised as I was. After that it became a kind of game\u2014to see how much I could stand. To see how much they could do to me before I\u2019d\u2014\u201dHe breaks off abruptly. I can\u2019t hear any more; don\u2019t want to know, don\u2019t want it to be true, can\u2019t stand to think of what they did to him there. I take another step forward and reach for his chest and shoulders in the dark. This time, he doesn\u2019t push me away. But he doesn\u2019t embrace me either. He stands there, cold, still, like a statue.\u201cAlex.\u201d I repeat his name like a prayer, like a magic spell that will make everything okay again. I run my hands up his chest and to his chin. \u201cI\u2019m so sorry. I\u2019m so, so sorry.\u201dSuddenly he jerks backward, simultaneously finding my wrists and pulling them down to my sides. \u201cThere were days I would rather they have killed me.\u201d He doesn\u2019t drop my wrists; he squeezes them tightly, pinning my arms, keeping me immobilized. His voice is low, urgent, and so full of anger it pains me even more than his grip. \u201cThere were days I asked for it\u2014prayed for it when I went to sleep. The belief that I would see you again, that I could find you\u2014the hope for it\u2014was the only thing that kept me going.\u201d He releases me and takes another step backward. \u201cSo no.

When the structure of hemoglobin was finally solved, the hemes were found to lie in isolated pockets on the surface of the subunits. Without contact between them how could one of them sense whether the others had combined with oxygen? And how could as heterogeneous a collection of chemical agents as protons, chloride ions, carbon dioxide, and diphosphoglycerate influence the oxygen equilibrium curve in a similar way? It did not seem plausible that any of them could bind directly to the hemes or that all of them could bind at any other common site, although there again it turned out we were wrong. To add to the mystery, none of these agents affected the oxygen equilibrium of myoglobin or of isolated subunits of hemoglobin. We now know that all the cooperative effects disappear if the hemoglobin molecule is merely split in half, but this vital clue was missed.

It is very evident what mean and sneaking lives many of you live, for my sight has been whetted by experience; always on the limits, trying to get into business and trying to get out of debt, a very ancient slough, called by the Latins aes alienum, another's brass, for some of their coins were made of brass; still living, and dying, and buried by this other's brass; always promising to pay, promising to pay, tomorrow, and dying today, insolvent; seeking to curry favor, to get custom, by how many modes, only not state-prison offences; lying, flattering, voting, contracting yourselves into a nutshell of civility or dilating into an atmosphere of thin and vaporous generosity, that you may persuade your neighbor to let you make his shoes, or his hat, or his coat, or his carriage, or import his groceries for him; making yourselves sick, that you may lay up something against a sick day, something to be tucked away in an old chest, or in a stocking behind the plastering, or, more safely, in the brick bank; no matter where, no matter how much or how little.": "Henry",

A woman has a right to go in and be counseled before she has an abortion.\u201d But Gosnell had flatly ignored the twenty-four-hour waiting period. He ignored the law, Pescatore said, out of simple greed. \u201cMoney. That was the only law that Dr. Gosnell knew,\u201d she said. \u201cYou went to 3801 Lancaster Avenue where no laws were followed. None, zero.\u201d The facts would show that Gosnell didn\u2019t do \u201cnormal, legal abortions\u201d largely because it was both cheaper and easier for him to induce labor, wait for the woman to give birth, and then kill the baby outside of the womb with scissors.": "Ann",

Still, every once in a while he made an exception, as he did with Carlin Leander.

Not even the crow nesting in the elm tree could dissuade him from his mission, for when he was beside Carlin, Gus acquired a strange optimism; in the light of her radiance the rest of the world began to shine. For a brief time, bad faith and human weakness could be forgotten or, at the very least, temporarily ignored. When it came time to go back to their rooms, Gus followed on the path, holding on to each moment, trying his best to stretch out time. Standing in the shadows of the rose arbor in order to watch Carlin climb back up the fire escape at St. Anne's, his heart ached. He could tell he was going to be devastated, and yet he was already powerless.

We can rejuvenate, feel better, live longer, but, even so, in this world everybody dies. That is why we do spiritual practice, because we are conscious of the destiny of our separation. We are willing to fulfill the law of love, but on the other hand what we love dies. That is why this is one of the realms of suffering. This world is not a heaven. This is not a place of fulfillment. Thus, we must yield to the true Condition. We must not become dependent upon the conventional aspect of our relations. We must recognize our relations. We must identify with the Condition of the loved one.You must become established in the real Condition, or you will never be satisfied. You will be driven to all kinds of preoccupations and great schemes, trying to become victorious or immortal, for immortality's own sake, simply because you cannot deal with the fact of death.

He said he would outlast all the wars and all the diseases, long enough to remember everything, and long enough to forget everything.

  "Music is a form that tends to give shape to rules, social mores, social attitudes, feelings\u2014it does this in a very beautiful, fluid way. To me the issue of form and formlessness is most strong in the theme of mortality versus a human wish for immortality of a sort. Take, for example, the definition of beauty in fashion. Remember what Alison says at the beginning? She says when she was young she didn\u2019t know what beautiful was. She looked at this woman who everyone was saying was beautiful and she didn\u2019t even know what they were talking about. I experienced that when I was a child. If I loved someone I thought they were really beautiful. And then eventually, I began to get it, the social concept of beauty. Not that I think beautiful is completely imaginary, but beauty is so wide ranging and fluid. Yet there\u2019s a need to say: \u201cThis is what it is, and it\u2019s not changing; we\u2019re taking a picture of it to hold it still.\u201d It\u2019s like an impulse to put up a building meant to last forever. An urge to grab and hold something in place when nothing human can be grabbed and held in place. We come into these physical bodies . . . whatever we are takes this shape that is so particular and distinct\u2014eyes, nose, mouth\u2014and then it gradually begins to disintegrate. Eventually it\u2019s going to dissolve completely. It\u2019s a huge problem for people; we can understand it, but it breaks our hearts. And so we\u2019re constantly trying to pin something down or leave a trace that will last forever. \u201cAnd this is the only immortality you and I may share, my Lolita . . .\u201d What other immortality will anyone share?": "Mary",

  "The Yogic path is about disentangling the built-in glitches of the human condition, which I'm going to over-simply define here as the heartbreaking inability to sustain contentment. Different schools of thought over the centuries have found different explanation for man's apparently inherently flawed state. Taoists call it imbalance, Buddism calls it ignorance, Islam blames our misery on rebellion against God, and the Judeo-Christian tradition attributes all our suffering to original sin. Freudians say that unhappiness is the inevitable result of the clash between our natural drives and civilization's needs. (As my friend Deborah the psychologist explains it: \"Desire is the design flaw.\") The Yogis, however, say that human discontentment is a simple case of mistaken identity. We're miserable because we think that we are mere individuals, alone with our fears and flaws and resentments and mortality. We wrongly believe that our limited little egos constitute our whole entire nature. We have failed to recognize our deeper divine character. We don't realize that, somewhere within us all, there does exist a supreme Self who is eternally at peace. That supreme Self is our true identity, universal and divine. Before you realize this truth, say the Yogis, you will always be in despair, a notion nicely expressed in this exasperated line from the Greek stoic philosopher Epictetus: \"You bear God within you, poor wretch, and know it not.": "Elizabeth",

  "This is the fairytale of my life, the mythology of my existence, and, as I only have one story to tell, there is only one way to tell it. You may find it a little melodramatic at moments and you may not like who I was at times. But, princes frequently start out as frogs and, perhaps, by the time I reach my end, you will understand why. And so, as we all must have a beginning, a middle and an end, I will start at the beginning. Once upon a time...": "James",
  "The morning after my mother\u2019s death, I was surprised to see the sunrise. From behind the curtain of my bedroom window I was surprised to see the people leave their homes and begin the day. Downstairs, the hands of the grandfather clock continued to tick, marking each passing hour with a chime that echoed over the black and white chessboard tiles of the front hall. I was surprised to see the mail come at the same time as the day before and, later that evening, the sun set once more as it did since the beginning of time. My mother\u2019s death did not disturb the planets in their courses. And, though everything kept moving like she never existed at all, my world erupted into chaos until the universe swirled around me like a whirlpool of scattering stars.": "James",
  "As we walked home, I knew from far away the trees would've looked nice, the grass would've looked green, and we would've looked like just a couple of boys walking home, armed with Midwest love and Bible Belt morals.But up close, the trees were scorched, the grass was dead, and the boys were on the verge of tears with the belts of those morals tightening around their necks, threatening to hang them if they dared step off the stool of masculinity.": "Tiffany",

And they would look into her like they were trying to pierce her eyes with theirs, like they were trying to make her heart stop, and the whole world would become background noise and she would take her first breath after all of these years of nothing but existing.

Rather, it was this fancy thing I lived in\u2014a mausoleum that beckoned the living, promising gratification, refuge, solace, peace, even immortality. It wasn\u2019t me. It wasn\u2019t mine.

I'm supposed to wear it as I hike up this trail toward my adulthood. They're already at the summit of Full Grown Mountain. They're waiting for me to get there and cheering me on, telling me I can do it, and sometimes scolding and asking why I'm not hiking any faster or why I'm not having more fun along the way. I know I'm not supposed to talk about this backpack full of their crazy, but sometimes I really wish we could all stop for a second. Maybe they could walk down the trail from the top and meet me. We could unzip that backpack, pull out all of those rocks, and leave the ones we no longer need by the side of the trail. It'd make the walk a lot easier.

The world, as portrayed in those works destined for young people, was divided in two: an ordinary, everyday world, brutal and unresponding to desires, and a spacious, logical world, about all kind, interesting and desirable.

Are these bad events catalysts for change, which bring out the resiliency and best in us? A cosmic wakeup call that reminds us to enjoy the good times, because they can be taken away so easily. How messed up and ironic would that be?Is it even possible for us to remember what goodness we\u2019re truly capable of on a daily basis, not just when things cause us to react out of necessity. A base line of beautiful acts and thoughts that are not brought out only by holiday music or someone else\u2019s misfortune, but remain at the surface of who we really are.

He spins out the tune like it is a tale he is telling her, until he feels her body relax, until he feels her falling into sleep. He sings to let her know he\u2019s there, to stay anchored to the earth, to keep from laughing or crying in amazement that he is lying with Alice in his arms, he sings as if music could keep her alive, as if music could feed her soul, as if music could weave a protective spell around her to survive these days and these weeks and these months and these years, he sings as if he could give her a piece of himself, which will ring inside of her like a bell, like a promise, like hope whenever she needs him; and in his singing, he promises her every single thing he can think of, and more.": "Laura",

We can love for so many different, and paradoxical, qualities in the object of our love--for strength or for weakness, for beauty or for ugliness, for gaiety or for sadness, for sweetness or for bitterness, for goodness or for wickedness, for need or for impervious independence. Then, if we wonder from what secret springs in ourselves gushes our love, our poor brain goes giddy from speculation, and we wonder what is all meaning and worth. Is it our own need that makes us lean toward and wish to succor need, or is it our strength? What way would our strength, if we had it, incline our heart? Do we give love in order to receive love, and even in the transport or endearment carry the usurer's tight-lipped and secret calculation, unacknowledged even by ourselves? Or do we give with an arrogance after all, a passion for self-definition? Or do we simply want a hand, any hand, a human object, to clutch in the dark on the blanket, and fear lies behind everything? Do we want happiness, or is it pain, pain as the index of reality, that we, in the chamber of our heart, want?Oh, if I knew the answer, perhaps then I could feel free.": "Robert",

It is not a girl's dress. It is solidly on the other side of the line outside of girlhood. It is a dress that says something big in a very quiet way; it is a dress that is talking to Alice right now, a dress that is making her feel possibilities never before considered, the possibility of perfume and pretty and dancing and boys.

  "I\u2019ve always resented the word maturity, primarily, I think, because it is most often used as a club. If you do something that someone doesn\u2019t like, you lack maturity, regardless of the actual merits of your action. Too, it seems to me that what is most often called maturity is nothing more than disengagement from life. If you meet life squarely, you are likely to make mistakes, do things you wish you hadn\u2019t, say things you wish you could retract or phrase more felicitously, and, in short, fumble your way along. Those \u201cmature\u201d people whose lives are even without a single sour note or a single mistake, who never fumble, manage only at the cost of original thought and original action. They do without the successes as well as the failures. This has never appealed to me and that is another reason I could never accept the common image of maturity that was presented to me.It was only after I came back from Trial that I came to a notion of my own as to what maturity consists of. Maturity is the ability to sort the portions of truth from the accepted lies and self-deceptions that you have grown up with. It is easy now to see the irrelevance of the religious wars of the past, to see that capitalism in itself is not evil, to see that honor is most often a silly thing to kill a man for, to see that national patriotism should have meant nothing in the twenty-first century, to see that a correctly-arranged tie has very little to do with true social worth. It is harder to assess as critically the insanities of your own time, especially if you have accepted them unquestioningly for as long as you can remember, for as long as you have been alive. If you never make the attempt, whatever else you are, you are not mature.": "Alexei",

  "We are afraid of what we will do to others, afraid of the rage that lies in wait somewhere deep in our souls. How many human beings go through the world frozen with rage against life! This deeply hidden inner anger may be the product of hurt pride or of real frustration in office, factory, clinic, or home. Whatever may be the cause of our frozen rage (which is the inevitable mother of depression), the great word of hope today is that this rage can be conquered and drained off into creative channels \u2026\u2026What should we do? We should all learn that a certain amount of aggressive energy is normal and certainly manageable in maturity. Most of us can drain off the excess of our angry feelings and destructive impulses in exercise, in competitive games, or in the vigorous battles against the evils of nature and society. We also must realize that no one will punish us for the legitimate expression of self-assertiveness and creative pugnacity as our parents once punished us for our undisciplined temper tantrums. Furthermore, let us remember that we need not totally repress the angry part of our nature. We can always give it an outlet in the safe realm of fantasy. A classic example of such fantasy is given by Max Beerborn, who made a practice of concocting imaginary letters to people he hated. Sometimes he went so far as to actually write the letters and in the very process of releasing his anger it evaporated. As mature men and women we should regard our minds as a true democracy where all kinds of ideas and emotions should be given freedom of speech. If in political life we are willing to grant civil liberties to all sorts of parties and programs, should we not be equally willing to grant civil liberties to our innermost thoughts and drives, confident that the more dangerous of them will be outvoted by the majority within our minds? Do I mean that we should hit out at our enemy whenever the mood strikes us? No, I repeat that I am suggesting quite the reverse\u2014self-control in action based upon (positive coping mechanisms such as) self expression in fantasy.": "Joshua",

The companies found various ways to make the data seem more favorable to their products, and the FDA helped them keep their negative data secret.

  "What is the use of the colon? What is a colon? Generally it opens onto an explanation, but it is always done with the help of an interruption. It can be said that the colon is not the period, it is the period of the period, the canceling of the period. It is a moment mute and marked; it is the most delicate tattoo of the text. It is also in place of, instead of, everything that would be causal. For example, when we read: \"It's simply that: secret.\" \"Secret,\" is a sentence, it is the shortest sentence perhaps. But it is a sentence in one word. It is a sentence that is secret and that at the same time says its name. One could invert and say: \"Secret: it is simply that.\" This is secret, the secret is the secret of this, it is a word which makes infinite sense all by itself, it is a sentence which performs the secret itself [Clarice Lispector, The Stream of Life, trans Elizabeth Lowe & Earl Fitz, Foreword by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous trans Verena Conley, Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1989]": "H\u00e9l\u00e8ne",

When customers came down the rutted road to the small eighteenth-century barn where the sisters worked, they marveled at the jasmine that twined through the split-rail fence, the perfume so intense they could feel it in their mouths. As they paid for their purchases, they wondered (vaguely, it must be said, for the people of Granite Point knew not to think too hard about the Sisters) how it was that clematis and honeysuckle climbed the barn in November and the morning glories bloomed all day. The fruit trees were so fecund that the peaches hung on the low branches, surrounded by more blossoms, apples and pears ripened in June and stayed sweet and fresh into December. Their Italian fig trees were heavy with purple teardrop fruit only weeks after they were planted. If you wanted a tomato so ripe the juice seemed to move beneath the skin, you needed only to pick up a punnet at the Nursery.": "Ellen",
  "Roses climbed the shed, entwined with dark purple clematis, leaves as glossy as satin. There were no thorns. Patience's cupboard was overflowing with remedies, and the little barn was often crowded with seekers. The half acre of meadow was wild with cosmos and lupine, coreopsis, and sweet William. Basil, thyme, coriander, and broad leaf parsley grew in billowing clouds of green; the smell so fresh your mouth watered and you began to plan the next meal. Cucumbers spilled out of the raised beds, fighting for space with the peas and beans, lettuce, tomatoes, and bright yellow peppers.The cart was righted out by the road and was soon bowed under glass jars and tin pails of sunflowers, zinnias, dahlias, and salvia. Pears, apples, and out-of-season apricots sat in balsa wood baskets in the shade, and watermelons, some with pink flesh, some with yellow, all sweet and seedless, lined the willow fence.": "Ellen",
  "Some flowers blush sensing their own beauty and the love they feel from us": "Brent",
  "There was something wonderful about the atmosphere at Stony Cross Park. One could easily imagine it as some magical place set in some far-off land. The surrounding forest was so deep and thick as to be primeval in appearance, while the twelve-acre garden behind the manor seemed too perfect to be real. There were groves, glades, ponds, and fountains. It was a garden of many moods, alternating tranquility with colorful tumult. A disciplined garden, every blade of grass precisely clipped, the corners of the box hedges trimmed to knife blade crispness. Hatless, gloveless, and infused with a sudden sense of optimism, Annabelle breathed deeply of the country air. She skirted the edge of the terraced gardens at the back of the manor and followed a graveled path set between raised beds of poppies and geraniums. The atmosphere soon became thick with the perfume of flowers, as the path paralleled a drystone wall covered with tumbles of pink and cream roses.Wandering more slowly, Annabelle crossed through an orchard of ancient pear trees, sculpted by decades into fantastic shapes. Farther off, a canopy of silver birch led to woodland beds that appeared to melt seamlessly into the forest beyond.": "Lisa",
  "And then there was the expansive garden that ran the length of the rear of the house- lush with color and fragrances that seemed to burst from every branch and bloom. Whoever had designed it possessed a keen eye for beauty, each plant chosen with obvious care and an affinity for nature.She'd even acquired a new cat from its depths, a stray orange tom she found wandering among the hydrangea bushes one morning. An offered dish of milk and he'd been her bosom beau ever since. She'd decided to call him Ranunculus because Buttercup was far too feminine a name for such a large and impressive male. She gazed at him now where he slept in the sunshine, basking like a small potentate in the heat of the day.": "Tracy",
  "She closed her eyes and listened to the drone of bees as they moved lazily among the flowering bursts of deep pink hydrangea and delicate tendrils of sweet pea that wound through the basket-bed borders. Although she was still very weak, it was pleasant to sit in warm lethargy, half-drowsing like a cat.She was slow to respond when she heard a sound from the doorway... a single light rap, as if the visitor was reluctant to disrupt her reverie with a loud knock. Blinking her sun-dazzled eyes, Annabelle remained sitting with her legs tucked beneath her. The mass of light speckles gradually faded from her vision, and she found herself staring at Simon Hunt's dark, lean form. He had leaned part of his weight on the doorjamb, bracing a shoulder against it in an unselfconsciously rakish pose. His head was slightly tilted as he considered her with an unfathomable expression.Annabelle's pulse escalated to a mad clatter. As usual, Hunt was dressed impeccably, but the gentlemanly attire did nothing to disguise the virile energy that seemed to emanate from him. She recalled the hardness of his arms and chest as he had carried her, the touch of his hands on her body... oh, she would never be able to look at him again without remembering!\"You look like a butterfly that's just flown in from the garden,\" Hunt said softly.": "Lisa",

I plucked a sprig of Queen Anne's lace and watched a black swallowtail butterfly land on a branch of goldenrod. Then I stretched and took a deep breath. The air was mellow and sweet.": "Mary",
  "French toast? Frittata?Definitely frittata.Leaving the table again, she transferred a small packet from freezer to fridge. It was salmon, home-smoked on the island and more delicious than any she had ever found elsewhere. Smoked salmon wasn't Cecily's doing, but the dried basil and thyme she took from the herb rack were. Taking a vacuum-sealed package of sun-dried tomatoes from the cupboard, she set it on the counter beside the herbs. Frittata, hot biscuits, and fruit salad. With mimosas. And coffee. That sounded right. Eaten out on the deck maybe?No, not on the deck, unless the prevailing winds turned suddenly warm.They would eat here in the kitchen, with whatever flowers the morning produced. Surely more lavender. A woman could never have enough lavender- or daylilies or astilbe, neither of which should bloom this early, but both of which had looked further along than the lavender, yesterday morning, so you never knew.": "Barbara",
  "Perched up on salvaged bricks, the half-pipes made perfect planters with an industrial edge that oddly complemented Sugar's pretty favorites: pansies, lantana, verbena and heliotrope.She laid two of them by the long wall of the taller building next door and planted a clematis vine at one end and a moonflower vine at the other: the clematis because the variety she picked had the prettiest purple bloom and the moonflower because it opened in the early evening and emanated a heavenly scent just when a person most felt like smelling one.": "Sarah-Kate",
  "The estate looked vast and prosperous- on the surface, at least. Bella Vista was stunningly lovely, the orchards well tended and clearly productive. If there was a place in the world that was closer to heaven, she wasn't aware of it. Bella Vista- Beautiful View.

The scents of ripe apples, lavender and roses rode the breeze, mingling with the mind-melting aroma of Isabel's fresh-baked croissants.": "Susan",
  "Sugar had grown up in Charleston, South Carolina: possibly the most luscious of the world's garden cities. Behind every wrought-iron gate or exposed-brick wall in the picturesque peninsula blooming between the Ashley and Cooper Rivers lay a sweet-scented treasure trove of camellias, roses, gardenias, magnolias, tea olives, azaleas and jasmine, everywhere, jasmine.With its lush greenery, opulent vines, sumptuous hedgerows and candy-colored window boxes, it was no wonder the city's native sons and daughters believed it to be the most beautiful place on earth.In her first years of exile Sugar had tried to cultivate a reminder of the luxuriant garden delights she had left behind, struggling in sometimes hostile elements to train reluctant honeysuckle and sulky sweet potato vines or nurture creeping jenny and autumn stonecrop.": "Sarah-Kate",

  "It was a garden, a walled garden. Overgrown but with beautiful bones visible still. Someone had cared for this garden once. The remains of two paths snaked back and forth, intertwined like the lacing on an Irish dancing shoe. Fruit trees had been espaliered around the sides, and wires zigzagged from the top of one wall to the top of another. Hungry, wisteria branches had woven themselves around to form a sort of canopy.Against the southern wall, an ancient and knobbled tree was growing. Cassandra went closer. It was the apple tree, she realized, the one whose bough had reached over the wall. She lifted her hand to touch one of the golden fruit. The tree was about sixteen feet high and shaped like the Japanese bonsai plant Nell had given Cassandra for her twelfth birthday.": "Kate",
  "This morning the green fists of the peonies are getting readyto break my heartas the sun rises, as the sun strokes them with his old, buttery fingersand they open \u2014pools of lace, white and pink \u2014and all day the black ants climb over them,boring their deep and mysterious holesinto the curls, craving the sweet sap, taking it awayto their dark, underground cities \u2014and all dayunder the shifty wind, as in a dance to the great wedding,the flowers bend their bright bodies, and tip their fragrance to the air, and rise, their red stems holdingall that dampness and recklessness gladly and lightly, and there it is again \u2014 beauty the brave, the exemplary,blazing open. Do you love this world? Do you cherish your humble and silky life?

  "Shall I tell you the secret of true love? her father once asked her. A friend of mine liked to tell me that women love flowers. He had many flirtations, but he never found a wife. Do you know why?

Only one woman loves wild geraniums.That\u2019s Mama! Inej had cried.Yes, Mama loves wild geraniums because no other flower has quite the same color, and she claims that when she snaps the stem and puts a sprig behind her ear, the whole world smells like summer. Many boys will bring you flowers. But someday you\u2019ll meet a boy who will learn your favorite flower, your favorite song, your favorite sweet.

Flowers should not stand with the stiffness of a soldier on parade but must carry themselves with the relaxedness of a dancer, their arms outstretched above a shaggy mane. Life reveals few sights as distressing as the look of flowers standing mournfully at attention unstirred by the kisses of a million bees. This infection of uncomely reserve is the handiwork of sombre gardeners bred in sombre societies who will not consider their work done till their flowers exude in aspect that stiffness they esteem. They forget that God intended that we mingle with flowers and not merely admire them from afar. But there is a look in a fastidiously manicured garden that makes me keep my distance, a look that draws my eyes but scorns my touch, and that is why I condemn them.": "Agona",

An air conditioner exhaust fan chitters angrily near the roof\u2019s edge, one of its blades bent just enough to scrape against the side of the casing. For a second I let the wind push me close enough to the fan\u2019s razor- sharp blades that a lock of my hair gets snipped and sent out into the night.

The sweet perfume of the flowers had already spread into the surrounding air, which being free from every taint, conducted to her lips a full measure of the fragrance received from the spire of blossom in its midst. At the top of the pole were crossed hoops decked with small flowers; beneath these came a milk-white zone of Maybloom;then a zone of bluebells, then of cowslips, then of lilacs, then of ragged-rosins, daffodils and so on, till the lowest stage was reached.Thomasin noticed all these, and was delighted that the May revel was to be so near.": "Thomas",

Comfrey, the purple hand-in-hand with the white, crept forth to take its place in the line; and at last one morning the diffident and delaying dog-rose stepped delicately on the stage, and one knew, as if string music has announced it in stately chords that strayed into a gavotte, that June at last was here. One member of the company was still awaited; the shepherd-boy for the nymphs to woo, the knight for whom the ladies waited at the window, the prince that was to kiss the sleeping summer back to life and love.

If you dig up a clump when no one is nearby and there is no danger of being shot, you'll find that there are scores of little bulbs in each clump, the progeny of a dozen or so planted by the farmer's wife in 1942. If you take these home, separate them, and plant them in your own yard, within a couple of years, you'll have a hundred daffodils for the mere price of a trespassing fine or imprisonment or both.

Most practicing obstetricians have never witnessed an unplugged birth that wasn't an accident.

And even when a pregnancy does occur, when the surprise moment of conception is confirmed, doctors give us a due date which can only be an approximation, for when and how the baby arrives is also a matter beyond determination. For this reason, in my opinion, almost nothing more than a pregnancy and birth deserve to be called synchronistic: the random coincidence of one of millions of sperm meeting a particular egg, yet from this coincidence, which we do not ultimately control, grows all of life.

  "I sat against one of the house\u2019s clay walls. The kinship I felt suddenly for the old land... it surprised me. I\u2019d been gone long enough to forget and be forgotten. I had a home in a land that might as well be in another galaxy to the people sleeping on the other side of the wall I leaned against. I thought I had forgotten about this land. But I hadn\u2019t. And, under the bony glow of a halfmoon, I sensed Afghanistanhumming under my feet. Maybe Afghanistan hadn\u2019t forgotten me either. I looked westward and marveled that, somewhere over those mountains, Kabul still existed. It really existed, not just as an old memory, or as the heading of an AP story on page 15 of the San FranciscoChronicle. Somewhere over those mountains in the west slept the city where my harelipped brother and I had run kites. Somewhere over there, the blindfolded man from my dream had died a needless death. Once, over those mountains, I had made a choice. And now, a quarter of a century later, that choice had landed me right back on this soil.": "Khaled",

  "Drugs and medical technology can be enormously beneficial when used to take care of real complications, but too often they are abused when applied to women birthing normally. These women are thus subjected to unnecessary risks. The key to this problem is informed consent, an ideal too seldom realized. Informed consent means that no woman during pregnancy or labor should ever be deceived into thinking that any drug or procedure (Demerol, Seconal, spinals, caudals, epidurals, paracervical block, etc.) is guaranteed safe. Not only are there no guaranteed safe drugs, but many of them have well-known, recognized side effects and potential side effects.Informed consent should mean that no woman would ever hear such falsehoods as, \u201cThis is harmless,\u201d or, \u201cI only give it in such a small dose that it can\u2019t affect the baby,\u201d or, \u201cThis is just a local and won\u2019t reach the baby.": "Susan",

This moment is just now being born\u2014you can never find a past to this present moment, you can never find something before it. Yet also, this moment is just now dying \u2014 you can never find a future to this moment, never find something after it.

  "A late arrival had the impression of lots of loud people unnecessarily grouped within a smoke-blue space between two mirrors gorged with reflections. Because, I suppose, Cynthia wished to be the youngest in the room, the women she used to invite, married or single, were, at the best, in their precarious forties; some of them would bring from their homes, in dark taxis, intact vestiges of good looks, which, however, they lost as the party progressed. It has always amazed me - the capacity sociable weekend revelers have of finding almost at once, by a purely empiric but very precise method, a common denominator of drunkenness, to which everybody loyally sticks before descending, all together, to the next level. The rich friendliness of the matrons was marked by tomboyish overtones, while the fixed inward look of amiably tight men was like a sacrilegious parody of pregnancy. Although some of the guests were connected in one way or another with the arts, there was no inspired talk, no wreathed, elbow-propped heads, and of course no flute girls. From some vantage point where she had been sitting in a stranded mermaid pose on the pale carpet with one or two younger fellows, Cynthia, her face varnished with a film of beaming sweat, would creep up on her knees, a proffered plate of nuts in one hand, and crisply tap with the other the athletic leg of Cochran or Corcoran, an art dealer, ensconced, on a pearl-grey sofa, between two flushed, happily disintegrating ladies.At a further stage there would come spurts of more riotous gaiety. Corcoran or Coransky would grab Cynthia or some other wandering woman by the shoulder and lead her into a corner to confront her with a grinning imbroglio of private jokes and rumors, whereupon, with a laugh and a toss of her head, he would break away. And still later there would be flurries of intersexual chumminess, jocular reconciliations, a bare fleshy arm flung around another woman's husband (he standing very upright in the midst of a swaying room), or a sudden rush of flirtatious anger, of clumsy pursuit-and the quiet half smile of Bob Wheeler picking up glasses that grew like mushrooms in the shade of chairs.

At one point, he tried to wean Lucy off the good stuff and onto Boone's Farm apple wine. Assuming she would delight in the fruity swill, he purchased a case and filled her glass one night at dinner. Lucy took a sip of the apple wine, noticed her parents were drinking something else, and put her glass down. She then graabbed Maurice's glass of Chablis and polished it off.

Then, for a long time, he stayed away, and if he had stayed away long enough he would have been all right; but one night he began walking down it again - and met the girl. It was inevitable that on Fool's Street there should be women as well as wine.He had walked down it many times in many different towns, and now he was walking down it once again in yet another town.

But men who rape are men who watch for the signs of who they believe they can rape. Rape culture isn\u2019t a natural occurrence; it thrives thanks to the dedicated attention given to women in order to take away their security.

  "I shall always attribute my uncertain start in New Zealand to the fact that I was introduced too early to what is knows as the 'five o'clock swill'. The phrase has, when you consider it, a wonderful pastoral - one might almost say idyllic - ring to it. It conjures up a picture of fat but hungry porcines, all freshly scrubbed, eagerly and gratefully partaking of their warm mash from the horny but kindly hands of the jovial farmer, a twinkling eyed son of the soil.Nothing could be further from the truth.The five o'clock swill is the direct result of New Zealand's imbecilic licensing laws. In order to prevent people getting drunk the pubs close at six, just after the workers leave work.

It's really, really tiring. Sometimes you just want to stand there silently, alone with your thoughts. Sometimes you just want to stand in the corner and stare out of the window. Now the problem is, when you can't smoke, if you stand and stare out of the window on your own, you're an antisocial, friendless idiot. If you stand and stare out of the window on your own with a cigarette, you're a fucking philosopher.": "Rory",

  "The social prestige of wine at table and at the club must be destroyed through lofty example and polite ridicule; forces which are not always available, and for whose successful operation much time will be required. But the outstanding fact remains, that the world has come to regard liquor in a new and clearer light. Our next generation of poets will contain but few Anacreons, for the thinking element of mankind has robbed the flowing bowl of its fancied virtues and fictitious beauties. The grape, so long permitted to masquerade as the inspirer of wit and art, is now revealed as the mother of ruin and death. The wolf at last stands divested of its sheep\u2019s clothing.": "H.P.",

My shoes were always broken down and old, I disliked shoe stores too. I never purchased anything until it was completely unusable, and that included automobiles.

  "It is no longer necessary to preach sonorously of the sinful and deleterious effect of liquor on the human mind and body; the essential evil is recognised scientifically, and only the sophistry of conscious immorality remains to be combated. Brewers and distillers still strive clumsily to delude the public by the transparent misstatements of their advertisements, and periodicals of easy conscience still permit these advertisements to disgrace their pages; but the end of such pernicious pretension is not remote. The drinker of yesterday flaunted his voice before all without shame; the average drinker of today must needs resort to excuses.": "H.P.",
  "Though at times interested in reforms, notably prohibition (I have never tasted alcoholic liquor), I was inclined to be bored by ethical casuistry; since I believed conduct to be a matter of taste and breeding, with virtue, delicacy, and truthfulness as symbols of gentility. Of my word and honour I was inordinately proud, and would permit no reflections to be cast upon them. I thought ethics too obvious and commonplace to be scientifically discussed, and considered philosophy solely in its relation to truth and beauty. I was, and still am, pagan to the core.": "H.P.",

  "And even in the open air the stench of whiskey was appalling. To this fiendish poison, I am certain, the greater part of the squalor I saw is due. Many of these vermin were obviously not foreigners\u2014I counted at least five American countenances in which a certain vanished decency half showed through the red whiskey bloating. Then I reflected upon the power of wine, and marveled how self-respecting persons can imbibe such stuff, or permit it to be served upon their tables. It is the deadliest enemy with which humanity is faced. Not all the European wars could produce a tenth of the havock occasioned among men by the wretched fluid which responsible governments allow to be sold openly. Looking upon that mob of sodden brutes, my mind\u2019s eye pictured a scene of different kind; a table bedecked with spotless linen and glistening silver, surrounded by gentlemen immaculate in evening attire\u2014and in the reddening faces of those gentlemen I could trace the same lines which appeared in full development of the beasts of the crowd. Truly, the effects of liquor are universal, and the shamelessness of man unbounded. How can reform be wrought in the crowd, when supposedly respectable boards groan beneath the goblets of rare old vintages? Is mankind asleep, that its enemy is thus entertained as a bosom friend? But a week or two ago, at a parade held in honour of the returning Rhode Island National Guard, the Chief Executive of this State, Mr. Robert Livingston Beeckman, prominent in New York, Newport, and Providence society, appeared in such an intoxicated condition that he could scarce guide his mount, or retain his seat in the saddle, and he the guardian of the liberties and interests of that Colony carved by the faith, hope, and labour of Roger Williams from the wilderness of savage New-England! I am perhaps an extremist on the subject of prohibition, but I can see no justification whatsoever for the tolerance of such a degrading demon as drink.": "H.P.",

In modern life, people think that their body belongs to them and they can do anything they want to it... This is one of the manifestations of individualism.

Men and women were sitting on all the baggage and boxes on top, and the women all had their fans going in the sun. It certainly was hot. Robert climbed down and fitted into the place he had saved on the one wooden seat that ran across the top. Robert Cohn stood in the shade of the arcade waiting for us to start. A Basque with a big leather wine-bag in his lap lay across the top of the bus in front of our seat, leaning back against our legs. He offered the wine-skin to Bill and to me, and when I tipped it up to drink he imitated the sound of a klaxon motor-horn so well and so suddenly that spilled some of the wine, and everybody laughed. He apologized and made me take another drink. He made the klaxon again a little later, and it fooled me the second time. He was very good at it. The Basques liked it. The man next to Bill was talking to him in Spanish and Bill was not getting it, so he offered the man one of the bottles of wine. The man waved it away. He said it was too hot and he had drunk too much at lunch. When Bill offered the bottle the second time he took a long drink, and then the bottle went all over that part of the bus.

  "Remembering that I'll be dead soon is the most important tool I've ever encountered to help me make the big choices in life.Almost everything--all external expectations, all pride, all fear of embarrassment or failure--these things just fall away in the face of death, leaving only what is truly important. Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose. You are already naked. There is no reason not to follow your heart. No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don't want to die to get there. And yet, death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it, and that is how it should be, because death is very likely the single best invention of life. It's life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new.": "Steve",

The old one, the wise one. Stop thinking about saving your face. Think of our lives and tell us your particularized world. Make up a story. Narrative is radical, creating us at the very moment it is being created. We will not blame you if your reach exceeds your grasp; if love so ignites your words they go down in flames and nothing is left but their scald. Or if, with the reticence of a surgeon's hands, your words suture only the places where blood might flow. We know you can never do it properly - once and for all. Passion is never enough; neither is skill. But try. For our sake and yours forget your name in the street; tell us what the world has been to you in the dark places and in the light. Don't tell us what to believe, what to fear. Show us belief s wide skirt and the stitch that unravels fear's caul.

What is required of us now is a new era of responsibility - a recognition, on the part of every American, that we have duties to ourselves, our nation, and the world, duties that we do not grudgingly accept but rather seize gladly, firm in the knowledge that there is nothing so satisfying to the spirit, so defining of our character, than giving our all to a difficult task.": "Barack",

Christianity has been too often in what seemed deadly peril, that we should fear for it any new trial now. So far is certain; on the other hand, what is uncertain, and in these great contests commonly is uncertain, and what is commonly a great surprise, when it is witnessed, is the particular mode by which, in the event, Providence rescues and saves His elect inheritance. Sometimes our enemy is turned into a friend; sometimes he is despoiled of that special virulence of evil which was so threatening; sometimes he falls to pieces of himself; sometimes he does just so much as is beneficial, and then is removed.

Is the pain worth someone\u2019s life? If you could actually save somebody? Can you imagine?

You\u2019ve saved somebody\u2019s life, I don\u2019t know. What about this? Let\u2019s say you have a problem in your life. And you want to give up now. Imagine if someone 10 years older who\u2019s gone through the exact same thing that you have \u2013 actually got through it and came to you and said, \u201cyou know what, I know how it feels. I\u2019ve been there! I\u2019ve been going through what you\u2019re going through now. But I\u2019m still here. Would that not encourage you? Could that possibly save your life? Yes.

But anyone who does love math knows it's really the opposite: math rewards simplicity, and mathematicians value it above all else. So it's no surprise that Walter's favourite axiom was also the most simple in the realm of mathematics: the axiom of the empty set. The axiom of the empty set is the axiom of zero. it states that there must be a concept of nothingness, that there must be the concept of zero: zero value, zero items. Math assumes there's a concept of nothingness, but is it proven? No. But it must exist.And if we're being philosophical\u2014which we today are\u2014we can say that life itself is the axiom of the empty set. It begins in zero and ends in zero. We know that both states exist, but we will not be conscious of either experience: they are states that are necessary parts of life, even as they cannot be experienced as life. We assume the concept of nothingness, but we cannot prove it. But it must exist. So I prefer to think that Walter has not died but has instead proven for himself the axiom of the empty set, that he has proven the concept of zero. I know nothing else would have made him happier.

But the occasional occurrence of the improbable does not imply the intervention of a higher power, something in the nature of a miracle, as the layman is so ready to assume.

  "Two writings of al-Hass\u0101r have survived. The first, entitled Kit\u0101b al-bay\u0101n wa t-tadhk\u0101r [Book of proof and recall] is a handbook of calculation treating numeration, arithmetical operations on whole numbers and on fractions, extraction of the exact or approximate square root of a whole of fractionary number and summation of progressions of whole numbers (natural, even or odd), and of their squares and cubes. Despite its classical content in relation to the Arab mathematical tradition, this book occupies a certain important place in the history of mathematics in North Africa for three reasons: in the first place, and notwithstanding the development of research, this manual remains the most ancient work of calculation representing simultaneously the tradition of the Maghrib and that of Muslim Spain. In the second place, this book is the first wherein one has found a symbolic writing of fractions, which utilises the horizontal bar and the dust ciphers i.e. the ancestors of the digits that we use today (and which are, for certain among them, almost identical to ours) [Woepcke 1858-59: 264-75; Zoubeidi 1996]. It seems as a matter of fact that the utilisation of the fraction bar was very quickly generalised in the mathematical teaching in the Maghrib, which could explain that Fibonacci (d. after 1240) had used in his Liber Abbaci, without making any particular remark about it [Djebbar 1980 : 97-99; Vogel 1970-80]. Thirdly, this handbook is the only Maghribian work of calculation known to have circulated in the scientific foyers of south Europe, as Moses Ibn Tibbon realised, in 1271, a Hebrew translation.[Mathematics in the Medieval Maghrib: General Survey on Mathematical Activities in North Africa]": "Ahmed",

  "What is it, in fact, that we are supposed to abstract from, in order to get, for example, from the moon to the number 1? By abstraction we do indeed get certain concepts, viz. satellite of the Earth, satellite of a planet, non-self-luminous heavenly body, heavenly body, body, object. But in this series 1 is not to be met with; for it is no concept that the moon could fall under. In the case of 0, we have simply no object at all from which to start our process of abstracting. It is no good objecting that 0 and 1 are not numbers in the same sense as 2 and 3. What answers the question How many? is number, and if we ask, for example, \"How many moons has this planet?\", we are quite as much prepared for the answer 0 or 1 as for 2 or 3, and that without having to understand the question differently. No doubt there is something unique about 0, and about 1000; but the same is true in principle of every whole number, only the bigger the number the less obvious it is.

  "To return to the general analysis of the Rosicrucian outlook. Magic was a dominating factor, working as a mathematics-mechanics in the lower world, as celestial mathematics in the celestial world, and as angelic conjuration in the supercelestial world. One cannot leave out the angels in this world view, however much it may have been advancing towards the scientific revolution. The religious outlook is bound up with the idea that penetration has been made into higher angelic spheres in which all religions were seen as one; and it is the angels who are believed to illuminate man's intellectual activities.In the earlier Renaissance, the magi had been careful to use only the forms of magic operating in the elemental or celestial spheres, using talismans and various rituals to draw down favourable influences from the stars. The magic of a bold operator like Dee, aims beyond the stars, aims at doing the supercelestial mathematical magic, the angel-conjuring magic. Dee firmly believed that he had gained contact with good angels from whom he learned advancement in knowledge. This sense of close contact with angels or spiritual beings is the hallmark of the Rosicrucian. It is this which infuses his technology, however practical and successful and entirely rational in its new understanding of mathematical techniques, with an unearthly air, and makes him suspect as possibly in contact, not with angels, but with devils.": "Frances",

Proofs exist to establish once and for all, according to very high standards, that certain mathematical statements are irrefutable facts. What is unfortunate about this is that a proof, in spite of the fact that it is perfectly correct, does not in any way have to be enlightening.

This cascade of period doublings is reminiscent of the race between Achilles and the tortoise, in that an infinite number of bifurcations (or time steps in the race) can be confined to a local region of finite size. At a very special critical value, the dynamical system will fall into what is essentially an infinite-period limit cycle. This is chaos.": "Gary",

  "If you do the things you need to do when you need to do them, then someday you can do the things you want do when you want to do them.": "John",
  "This is the secret to mastering any discipline: as you conquer one, you'll find it easier to tackle another.": "Jeff",
  "There is something in human pride that can stand big troubles, but we need the supernatural grace and power of God to stand by us in the little things. The tiniest detail in which we obey has all the omnipotent power of the grace of God behind it. When we do our duty, not for duty\u2019s sake, but because we believe that God is engineering our circumstances in that way, then at the very point of our obedience the whole superb grace of God is ours.": "Oswald",
  "Under a bad leadership Serbs are capable of committing the most terrible atrocities; under good leaders we can do great deeds. It's like a field - if it's not cared for, the weeds will take over. But if you tend it, water and feed the seeds, you will read a bountiful harvest. Serbs are lazy, we lack discipline and have no capacity for self-criticism.\" With Their Backs to the World": "\u00c5sne",
  "To discipline your body, you need a disciplined mind!": "Mehmet",
  "Discipline is aimed at formation for a specific end, and that end is determined by our founding narrative.": "James",
  "Among men, it seems, historically at any rate, the processes of coordination and disintegration follow each other with great regularity, and the index of the coordination is the measure of the disintegration which follows. There is no mob like a group of well-drilled soldiers when they have thrown off their discipline. And there is no lostness like that which comes to a man when a perfect and certain pattern has dissolved about him. There is no hater like one who has greatly loved.": "John",
  "There are many whose tongues might govern multitudes, if they could govern their tongues.": "PRENTICE",
  "To procrastinate obedience is to disobey God.": "Randy",
  "Children cannot develop a sense of inner discipline if all of the control comes from the outside.": "Babara",

  "A career is wonderful, but you can't curl up with it on a cold night": "Marilyn",
  "I've learned that making a 'living' is not the same thing as 'making a life'.": "Maya",
  "Only those who decline to scramble up the career ladder are interesting as human beings. Nothing is more boring than a man with a career.": "Aleksandr",
  "No, scratch the word \"career.\" Careers are for people who wish to advance. I only want to survive, draw a paycheck. ": "Emily",
  "What you're really supposed to be doing is whatever makes your heart sing.": "Barbara",
  "Every time you have to make a choice about anything, think \"Does this go toward or away from what I want?\" Always choose what goes toward what you want.": "Barbara",
  "In the early days all I hoped was to make a living out of what I did best. But, since there\u2019s no real market for masturbation I had to fall back on my bass playing abilities.": "Les",
  "Every time you worry that you could get trapped in some kind of work you don't care about, you're dealing with the problem of meaningfulness. I guarantee that in the back of your mind is the thought that somehow you have to make a contribution to something, be acknowledged, do something that matters--or you're just fooling around.": "Barbara",
  "My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. I can dispense with artificial stimulants. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation. That is why I have chosen my own particular profession, or rather created it, for I am the only one in the world.": "Arthur",
  "When one door closes another opens but all too often there is a long hallway in between. ": "Rick",
  "Out of the current confusion of ideals and and confounding of career hopes, a calm recognition may yet emerge that productive labor is the foundation of all prosperity.": "Matthew",
  "what secular avocation on earth was there for a young man (whose friends could not get him an \u2018appointment\u2019) which was at once gentlemanly, lucrative, and to be followed without special knowledge?": "George",
  "The first test of ability and intelligence is to find a field of endeavor in which profits are large and risks small.": "James",
  "Action is the spark that ignites potential.": "John",
  "For success in corporate world, it is essential to identify and seek what you want.": "Abhishek",
  "Expertise in a subfield was the key to a successful career as an engineer, and expertise was becoming a necessity for the mathematicians and computers as well.": "Margot",
  "His name was Ed. His nickname was Scrambled Ed. On leaving school he had taken a year out to decide what he wanted to study at University. The year passed and he still hadn't decided but went to University anyway. 'Academic' is defined as 'of, or relating to, institutionalized education and scholarship'. The same word, at the same time, also means 'having little practical use or value, as by being overly detailed, unengaging or theoretical'. The latter definition seemed the most appropriate for Ed's university career which was a mash up of drinking, diving, surfing, kayaking and having his heart-broken. All washed down with a few pints. After three years of that he was awarded a second class joint honours degree which he put in the recycling bin and went in search of something that would make him feel better.": "Matt",
  "Make a life while making a living.": "Frank",
  "A nagging focus on time management makes us want to increase the speed of our lives. Maintaining a focus on priority management helps us recognize the need to slow down. When our use of time is built around well-defined priorities, life is less a question of how much we can get done and more a question of whether something is worth doing at all.": "Joe",
  "I\u2019d tell men and women in their midtwenties not to settle for a job or a profession or even a career. Seek a calling. Even if you don\u2019t know what that means, seek it. If you\u2019re following your calling, the fatigue will be easier to bear, the disappointments will be fuel, the highs will be like nothing you\u2019ve ever felt.": "Phil",
  "It is a common enough mid-career urge: having taken care of life's immediate needs, some of us yearn to chase villains, right wrongs, fight on the side of the angels.": "Tim",
  "Take it from me, an authority on expertise: You can't trust experts.": "Jeff",
  "When employers designate certain jobs \"professional\" and insist that employees have professional training \u2013 not just the technical skills that seem sufficient to do the work \u2013 they must have more in mind than efficiency. Hierarchical organizations need professionals, because through professionals those at the top control the political content of what is produced, and because professionals contribute to the bosses' control of the workforce itself.": "Jeff",
  "What exactly are you looking for in a job? Like, what\u2019s your best-case scenario for a new career?\u201d\u201cI haven\u2019t really thought that far. The best-case scenario is just that I look back on this entire era of my life and laugh and say, \u2018What a weird time that was. I can\u2019t believe I did that.": "Drew",
  "They want you to be the solution. Whoever is waiting in there for you\u2014interviewer, examiner, casting agent\u2014is hoping you are the answer to their search. Our fear or self-doubt can persuade us that those waiting in the room want us to fail, but that means you carry that closed or victim energy in. People get into the negative habit of preempting the worst-case scenario as a misplaced way of protecting themselves. Try to walk in instead with an \u2018I can be the solution to your problem\u2019 attitude. Not arrogant, just open. The rest is out of your hands, but the positivity in itself is empowering.": "Kate",
  "Everyone you meet should go into a people file (organized by categories) that you keep on your computer or phone. Include a few details about the person. Selected names should be placed on your \u201cbig-mouth\u201d e-mail list. It should consist of former bosses, former coworkers whom you want to stay in touch with, anyone who has mentored you, people you\u2019ve met who seem interested in your career. People on your big-mouth list then get sent an e-mail notification when you have important career news\u2014for instance, you\u2019ve switched jobs, been promoted, or started your own business.": "Kate",
  "When someone does a professional favor for you, send a handwritten note. You must send a written note to a mentor or sponsor when she helps you. Perhaps even a gift. And here\u2019s a great tip from Archambeau: When you take someone\u2019s advice, let her know it and how it worked out. So few people ever do that.": "Kate",
  "There are four stages to a person\u2019s career:In Stage 1 you are enthusiastic about your work, but inexperienced (start of your career).In Stage 2 you are both enthusiastic about your work and have gained experience (top of your career).In Stage 3 you\u2019re tired of your work, but you are also still competent/experienced (maintenance stage).In Stage 4 you are sick of your work, and because you haven\u2019t been motivated to keep up with your profession, you are now, once again, inexperienced relative to the state-of-the-art in your field (end of career).": "Clifford",
  "If you\u2019ve just had a brief conversation at an event, ask, \u201cIs it all right if I drop you a note?\u201d You can follow up with a question in writing. Also, periodically send your potential mentor or sponsor information that she will find insightful. When you have an accomplishment under your belt, let her know about it.": "Kate",

  "You can\u2019t get caught up in worrying about whether everyone you work with likes you. Ultimately you want the respect of your coworkers, but you don\u2019t need them to be your buddies.": "Kate",
  "If you haven\u2019t found your calling yet, the best thing to do is get your butt off your chair, fill your life with a wide array of unusual experiences, and allow yourself to bump into what will exhilarate you.": "Kate",
  "Rather than relying on a notebook, you should work with two spreadsheets on your computer; you use one to list all the companies you\u2019re aware of in the field or fields you\u2019re interested in and the other to list every single contact you have.": "Kate",
  "If you\u2019ve already worked in some capacity or done any internships, your contacts are everybody you\u2019ve met in your work plus all your personal contacts. If you haven\u2019t been employed yet, you still have plenty of contacts. \u201cTake out your college yearbook,\u201d says Wein. \u201cWho sat next to you in class? Who do you know that\u2019s gone into the field you\u2019re interested in? You don\u2019t have to know them well to put them on the list.\u201d You\u2019d also include any contacts your parents have, friends of your parents, people you met on family vacations, even kids you knew in summer camp.": "Kate",
  "Every day you should also be checking job boards to track positions as they open up. In addition to the job boards on company websites, use public job boards such as Monster, Indeed, LinkedIn, and any specialty sites. There\u2019s also your alumni website, etc.": "Kate",
  "Who knows, you may be that close. You could be uncovering a blind spot or two away to take your career to the next height...": "Assegid",
  "Start with a two-line summary of your background, and then say what you\u2019re looking for, being as specific as possible. It could go something like this: \u201cI just graduated with a degree in economics, and I worked at a hospital for my past two summers. I\u2019d love a job at a health-related website. I know you once worked for WebMD, and I\u2019d really welcome a personal introduction.": "Kate",
  "Do not cross your legs, she advises. Keeping both feet on the ground signals that you, well, have both feet on the ground. \u2026 If you feel the urge to move out of nervousness, do some toe crunches since the interviewer won\u2019t notice those.": "Kate",
  "Good questions are those that show that you not only want the job, you are prepared to knock the ball out of the park once you have it. So ask, \u201cWhat would a successful year in the job look like?\u201d or \u201cWhat did you most value in the person who left?\u201d You\u2019ve done a Google search of the field and the company, of course, and one of your questions could be about emerging trends. Interviewers love it when questions relate to them and their accomplishments (\u201cI\u2019ve heard you made some exciting changes recently. What has the outcome been?\u201d).": "Kate",
  "Come right out and say you want it: \u201cIt\u2019s been great hearing you talk about the position. I\u2019d love to work here, and I think I could do a terrific job for you.": "Kate",
  "Smile, look invested, and when you hand in certain projects, say you enjoyed working on them.": "Kate",
  "When your boss assigns you a project, take good notes and ask questions regarding anything you\u2019re not sure about. \u2026 The key question to ask: \u201cWhat are the results you\u2019re looking for?\u201d Be clear, too, about deadlines and who needs to be looped in on the project.": "Kate",
  "Lawrence\u2019s suggestion for a starter wardrobe: a black dress, a fitted black jacket, black pants, a black skirt, a camel-colored skirt, a white blouse, a trendy-looking cardigan in a color (red could be good, for instance), several cool, inexpensive blouses (from places such as H&M or Zara) that pick up or work with the color of the cardigan and will go with your pants and skirts. For shoes, go for black heels and a pair of colored ones (they will make one of your all-black outfits look totally fab). Then build from there.": "Kate",
  "Once you\u2019ve identified people who can be both mentors and sponsors, you need to make contact. Don\u2019t hesitate to introduce yourself to a potential ally at an event or in the elevator and say you admire her work. If the person is spearheading a committee or drive, volunteer to be on it. You can also request an informational interview. You could say something such as \u201cI\u2019ve heard so much about your work [or latest venture] and would love to know more about it.": "Kate",
  "If a job opens up that she could \u201csell\u201d you for, tell her, \u201cYou\u2019ve been such a valuable resource for me. I would really appreciate having your help on something. There\u2019s a terrific position open at Company A, and I\u2019m hoping you would be able to advocate on my behalf.\u201d Don\u2019t be shy about also asking a sponsor, \u201cDo you know anyone I could talk to?": "Kate",
  "When you create a r\u00e9sum\u00e9, for instance, it\u2019s not about listing every single role and responsibility you\u2019ve had. Instead it\u2019s about highlighting accomplishments that all ladder up to your overall positioning, expressing a clear point of view. You\u2019re taking control of the impressions you make by doing the work for them.": "Kate"
