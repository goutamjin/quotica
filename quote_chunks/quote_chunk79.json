  "In some instances, even when crisis intervention has been intensive and appropriate, the mother and daughter are already so deeply estranged at the time of disclosure that the bond between them seems irreparable. In this situation, no useful purpose is served by trying to separate the mother and father and keep the daughter at home. The daughter has already been emotionally expelled from her family; removing her to protective custody is simply the concrete expression of the family reality.These are the cases which many agencies call their \u201ctragedies.\u201d This report of a child protective worker illustrates a case where removing the child from the home was the only reasonable course of action:Division of Family and Children\u2019s Services received an anonymous telephone call on Sept. 14 from a man who stated that heoverheard Tracy W., age 8, of [address] tell his daughter of a forced oral-genital assault, allegedly perpetrated against this child by her mother\u2019s boyfriend, one Raymond S.Two workers visited the W. home on Sept. 17. According to their report, Mrs. W. was heavily under the influence of alcohol at the time of the visit. Mrs. W. stated immediately that she was aware why the two workers wanted to see her, because Mr. S. had \u201churt her little girl.\u201d In the course of the interview, Mrs. W. acknowledged and described how Mr. S. had forced Tracy to have relations with him. Workers then interviewed Tracy and she verified what mother had stated. According to Mrs. W., Mr. S. admitted the sexual assault, claiming that he was drunk and not accountable for his actions. Mother then stated to workers that she banished Mr. S. from her home.I had my first contact with mother and child at their home on Sept. 20 and I subsequently saw this family once a week. Mother was usually intoxicated and drinking beer when I saw her. I met Mr. S. on my second visit. Mr. S. denied having had any sexual relations with Tracy. Mother explained that she had obtained a license and planned to marry Mr. S.On my third visit, Mrs. W. was again intoxicated and drinking despite my previous request that she not drink during my visit. Mother explained that Mr. S. had taken off to another state and she never wanted to see him again. On this visit mother demanded that Tracy tell me the details of her sexual involvement with Mr. S. On my fourth visit, Mr. S. and Mrs. S. were present. Mother explained that they had been married the previous Saturday. On my fifth visit, Mr. S. was not present. During our discussion, mother commented that \u201cBay was not the \ufb01rst one who hadTracy.\u201d After exploring this statement with mother and Tracy, it became clear that Tracy had been sexually exploited in the same manner at age six by another of Mrs. S.'s previous boyfriends.On my sixth visit, Mrs. S. stated that she could accept Tracy\u2019s being placed with another family as long as it did not appear to Tracy that it was her mother\u2019s decision to give her up. Mother also commented, \u201cI wish the fuck I never had her.\u201dIt appears that Mrs. S. has had a number of other children all of whom have lived with other relatives or were in foster care for part of their lives.

Can it be correctly said, BECAUSE THE BEGGAR IS ALWAYS PREPARED TO RECEIVE, that 'he can have the alms, or not have it, just as he pleases?'

  "I was sitting down hanging with the fellas them just for the girls, because really and truly this was bugging me. How could these fellas have the finest girls in the community, and they don\u2019t work, they don\u2019t have any money. Anytime something has to be purchased they would say, \u2018Man, Scrooge, throw the blow; buy this and buy that.\u2019So we were sitting on a car one day. They were out to a disco the night before and this fella got chopped or stabbed. I didn\u2019t know anything about it until the fellas came around looking for KC the next day. These fellas just yuck out their guns and started busting shots, and everybody just break off running for their lives. Afterwards I mumbled to myself that these are some crazy fellas. They just came shooting for no reason. The funny thing about it is this: guns were not even that common on the streets then. We\u2019re talking around 1987, 1988. I believe the fella who fired those shots at us, goes by the nickname Dog and he lives in the US now.I said to Ada, \u2018What kind of thing this is? I mean, these fellas came and just started shooting.\u2019 That sent a whole new way of thinking in my mind. Prior to that, I was just a person going to work, coming home, and chilling. I just happened to be sitting there one day. They didn\u2019t know me and they didn\u2019t care who I was. I never used to even be with KC and them. I just happened to be there that day. If I had known that those fellas were crazy like that, to come shooting at whoever they saw, I wouldn\u2019t have been there hanging with KC and them. After that, my whole mindset changed.

  "Little girls are the nicest things that can happen to people. They are born with a bit of angel-shine about them, and though it wears thin sometimes, there is always enough left to lasso your heart\u2014even when they are sitting in the mud, or crying temperamental tears, or parading up the street in Mother\u2019s best clothes.A little girl can be sweeter (and badder) oftener than anyone else in the world. She can jitter around, and stomp, and make funny noises that frazzle your nerves, yet just when you open your mouth, she stands there demure with that special look in her eyes. A girl is Innocence playing in the mud, Beauty standing on its head, and Motherhood dragging a doll by the foot.God borrows from many creatures to make a little girl. He uses the song of a bird, the squeal of a pig, the stubbornness of a mule, the antics of a monkey, the spryness of a grasshopper, the curiosity of a cat, the speed of a gazelle, the slyness of a fox, the softness of a kitten, and to top it all off He adds the mysterious mind of a woman.A little girl likes new shoes, party dresses, small animals, first grade, noisemakers, the girl next door, dolls, make-believe, dancing lessons, ice cream, kitchens, coloring books, make-up, cans of water, going visiting, tea parties, and one boy. She doesn\u2019t care so much for visitors, boys in general, large dogs, hand-me-downs, straight chairs, vegetables, snowsuits, or staying in the front yard.She is loudest when you are thinking, the prettiest when she has provoked you, the busiest at bedtime, the quietest when you want to show her off, and the most flirtatious when she absolutely must not get the best of you again. Who else can cause you more grief, joy, irritation, satisfaction, embarrassment, and genuine delight than this combination of Eve, Salome, and Florence Nightingale.She can muss up your home, your hair, and your dignity\u2014spend your money, your time, and your patience\u2014and just when your temper is ready to crack, her sunshine peeks through and you\u2019ve lost again. Yes, she is a nerve-wracking nuisance, just a noisy bundle of mischief.

On the other hand, if they were made out of rubber, you could save yourself a lot of time and effort and heartache by just rustling one up out of a car tire. Boys are different from girls. Girls like to be cozy all the time but boys don't. First of all, they like to get all close to you like a coiled-up rubber band, but after a while, they get fed up with being too coiled and need to stretch away to their full stretchiness. Then, after a bit of on-their-own strategy, they ping back to be close to you. So in conclusion on the boy front, you have to play hard to get and also let them be elastic bands.": "Louise",

  "In the past few decades quite a few people have suggested -- citing most often the offence of impossible proportions -- that Barbie dolls teach young girls to hate themselves. But the opposite may be true. British researchers recently found that girls between the ages of seven and eleven harbor surprisingly strong feelings of dislike for their Barbie dolls, with no other toy or brand name inspiring such a negative response from the children. The dolls \"provoked rejection, hatred, and violence\" and many girls preferred Barbie torture -- by cutting, burning, decapitating, or microwaving -- over other ways of playing with the doll. Reasons that the girls hated their Barbies included, somewhat poetically, the fact that they were 'plastic.' The researchers also noted that the girls never spoke of one single, special Barbie, but tended to talk about having a box full of anonymous Barbies. 'On a deeper level Barbie has become inanimate,' one of the researchers remarked. 'She has lost any individual warmth that she might have possessed if she were perceived as a singular person.

  "I\u2019m going to say this once here, and then\u2014because it is obvious\u2014I will not repeat it in the course of this book: not all boys engage in such behavior, not by a long shot, and many young men are girls\u2019 staunchest allies. However, every girl I spoke with, every single girl\u2014regardless of her class, ethnicity, or sexual orientation; regardless of what she wore, regardless of her appearance\u2014had been harassed in middle school, high school, college, or, often, all three. Who, then, is truly at risk of being \u201cdistracted\u201d at school? At best, blaming girls\u2019 clothing for the thoughts and actions of boys is counterproductive. At worst, it\u2019s a short step from there to \u201cshe was asking for it.\u201d Yet, I also can\u2019t help but feel that girls such as Camila, who favors what she called \u201cmore so-called provocative\u201d clothing, are missing something. Taking up the right to bare arms (and legs and cleavage and midriffs) as a feminist rallying cry strikes me as suspiciously Orwellian. I recall the simple litmus test for sexism proposed by British feminist Caitlin Moran, one that Camila unconsciously referenced: Are the guys doing it, too? \u201cIf they aren\u2019t,\u201d Moran wrote, \u201cchances are you\u2019re dealing with what we strident feminists refer to as \u2018some total fucking bullshit.\u2019\u201d So while only girls get catcalled, it\u2019s also true that only girls\u2019 fashions urge body consciousness at the very youngest ages. Target offers bikinis for infants. The Gap hawks \u201cskinny jeans\u201d for toddlers. Preschoolers worship Disney princesses, characters whose eyes are larger than their waists. No one is trying to convince eleven-year-old boys to wear itty-bitty booty shorts or bare their bellies in the middle of winter. As concerned as I am about the policing of girls\u2019 sexuality through clothing, I also worry about the incessant drumbeat of self-objectification: the pressure on young women to reduce their worth to their bodies and to see those bodies as a collection of parts that exist for others\u2019 pleasure; to continuously monitor their appearance; to perform rather than to feel sensuality. I recall a conversation I had with Deborah Tolman, a professor at Hunter College and perhaps the foremost expert on teenage girls\u2019 sexual desire. In her work, she said, girls had begun responding \u201cto questions about how their bodies feel\u2014questions about sexuality or arousal\u2014by describing how they think they look. I have to remind them that looking good is not a feeling.": "Peggy",
  "Did I ever tell you that we used to keep our horses where your house is?\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I mumbled.She continued her story, \u201cMy brothers used to get up early every morning and go across the street, well, there wasn\u2019t a street there yet. It was just a dirt road, and they used to get up and clean the stables and feed the horses every morning. I would go over there once they had finished and give the horses a brush, even though none of those horses were mine. I had always wanted my own horse, but I never got one. When my father got older, he got rid of the horses and sold the land, all but this yard here.\"She spread her hand over the yard as she said this.\"I grew up and got married and had to move away. My husband and I lived in an apartment above a bread store. And it was so cramped, let me tell you. There was nowhere to move around and no yard to take care of. It was terrible. I\u2019m not saying I wanted my husband to die. I\u2019d never have wished that in a million years. But I was so relieved to come home after two years, and I've lived here ever since.\"I had stopped raking, turned and looked at her.\"I know why you don\u2019t want to leave this street,\" she said, \"You\u2019ve been in that house your whole life, just like me. And no matter where you go it\u2019s not going to seem like home. But just like me, you\u2019re going to come back. You have to remind yourself of that. And I did hate being away from home, but it was the most memorable time in my life, being away. It was an adventure as much as it was scary. But when I came home, I learned to get out more. I went to beauty school and got a job at the salon and took trips with friends. I like to get away from the house so that I can come back and still appreciate it. And you will too after you come back.\u201dI nodded at Violet. What she was saying made sense.\u201cI\u2019ll go,\u201d I said, \u201cTell them I\u2019ll go.\u201d- The Stable House": "Laura",

We're told not to go out by ourselves late at night, not to dress a certain way, not to talk to male strangers, not to lead men on.

We think of the brain as a glorified sausage machine, taking in information from the senses, processing it and regurgitating it in a different form, as thoughts or actions.

Indeed, the brain was the original inspiration and metaphor for the development of the digital computer, and early computers were often described as 'giant brains'. Unfortunately, neuroscientists have sometimes turned this analogy on its head, and based their models of brain function on the workings of the digital computer (for example by assuming that memory is separate and distinct from processing, as it is in a computer).

We should look more closely at the work of deformation that starts deeper down, especially because it involves so much demoralization. Something gets destroyed there that should not be destroyed under any circumstances - THE AWARENESS THAT KNOWLEDGE IS BORN OUT OF EUPHORIA AND THAT INTELLIGENCE IS A RELATIONSHIP OF THE HAPPY CONSCIOUSNESS WITH ITSELF. And that intelligence partly consists in the ability to find our own ways of overcoming the boredom that develops in an under-used brain. Across society as a whole, the most disturbing symptom is that people are no longer ambitious enough to plumb the limits of understanding within themselves. INTELLIGENCE IS THE LAST UTOPIAN POTENTIAL. THE ONLY TERRA INCOGNITA HUMANKIND STILL OWNS ARE THE GALAXIES OF THE BRAIN, THE MILKY WAYS OF INTELLIGENCE.

  "Science can now help us to understand ourselves in this way by giving factual information about brain structure and function, and how the mind works. Then there is an art of self knowledge, which each person has to develop for himself. This art must lead one to be sensitive to how his basically false approach to life is always tending to generate conflict and confusion. The role of art here is therefore not to provide a symbolism, but rather to teach the artistic spirit of sensitive perception of the individual and particular phenomena of one's own psyche. This spirit is needed if one is to understand the relevance of general scientific knowledge to his own special problems, as well as to give effect to the scientific spirit of seeing the fact about one's self as it is, whether on elikes it or not, and thus helping to end conflict.Such an approach is not possible, however, unless one has the spirit that meets life wholly and totally. We still need the religious spirit, but today we no longer need the religious mythology, which is now introducing an irrelevant and confusing element into the whole question.Itwould seem, then, that in some ways the modern person must manage to create a total approach to life which accomplishes what was done in earlier days by science, art and religion, but in a new way that is appropriate to the modern conditions of life. An important part of such an action is to see what the relationshipbetween science and art now actually is, and to understand the direction in which this relationship might develop.": "David",

Within just one cubic centimetre of brain tissue, there is the same number of connections as there are stars in the Milky Way. Your brain contains a hundred trillion of them. Information in the form of electricity and chemicals flows around these paths in great forking trails and in circuits and feedback loops and fantastical storms of activity tat bloom to life speeds of up to a hundred and twenty metres per second.

He envisions using not just a single Blue Gene computer [with over a hundred thousand processors and terabytes of RAM] but thousands of them, which would fill up not just a room but an entire city block.

Once the child is grown, substance abuse and exposure to a variety of toxins can damage the brain, modifying intelligence, aggression, and decision-making abilities.

No doubt a certain amount of what one usually calls \u201cperversion\u201d accounts for the pleasure, since what he enjoys, among other things, is his opacity. But that isn\u2019t the reason THEY continue to push the conspirator to make himself a critic, to subjectivate himself as critic, nor the reason for the hate THEY so commonly express.

And yet there is something deeply right, I think, about this knee-jerk appeal to publicity. It's as if to say: Everybody can write a poem, but has your poetry, the distillation of your innermost being, been found authentic and intelligible by others? Can it circulate among persons, make of its readership, however small, a People in that sense? This accounts for the otherwise bafflingly persistent association of Poetry and fame - baffling since no poets are famous among the general population.

  "To those who suspect that intellect is a subversive force in society, it will not do to reply that intellect is really a safe, bland, and emollient thing. In a certain sense, the suspicious Tories and militant philistines are right: intellect is dangerous. Left free, there is nothing it will not reconsider, analyze, throw into question. \"Let us admit the case of the conservative,\" John Dewey once wrote. \"If we once start thinking no one can guarantee what will be the outcome, except that many objects, ends and institutions will be surely doomed. Every thinker puts some portion of an apparently stable world in peril, and no one can wholly predict what will emerge in its place.\" Further, there is no way of guaranteeing that an intellectual class will be discreet and restrained in the use of its influence; the only assurance that can be given to any community is that it will be far worse off if it denies the free uses of the power of intellect than if it permits them. To be sure, intellectuals, contrary to the fantasies of cultural vigilantes, are hardly ever subversive of a society as a whole.

But we know that we cannot sympathise wholly or immerse ourselves wholly; there is always a demon in us who whispers, \"I hate, I love\", and we cannot silence him. Indeed, it is precisely because we hate and we love that our relation with the poets and novelists is so intimate that we find the presence of another person intolerable.

Your opinion is valid for you.

But in these questions there is no right and wrong. The relation between the reader and his book is as free and intimate as that between the mystic and his God. Of all forms of snobbishness the literary is perhaps the most detestable, and there is no excuse for the fool who despises his fellow-man because he does not share his opinion of the value of a certain book.

  "There is a kind of counter-criticism that seeks to expand the work of art, by connecting it, opening up its meanings, inviting in the possibilities. A great work of criticism can liberate a work of art, to be seen fully, to remain alive, to engage in a conversation that will not ever end but will instead keep feeding the imagination. Not against interpretation, but against confinement, against the killing of the spirit. Such criticism is itself a great art.This is a kind of criticism that does not pit the critic against the text, does not seek authority. It seeks instead to travel with the work and its ideas, to invite it to blossom and invite others into a conversation that might have previously seemed impenetrable, to draw out relationships that might have been unseen and open doors that might have been locked. This is a kind of criticism that respects the essential mystery of a work of art, which is in part its beauty and its pleasure, both of which are irreducible and subjective. The worst criticism seeks to have the last word and leave the rest of us in silence; the best opens up an exchange that need never end.": "Rebecca",

It is 'sentimentality' that is to be avoided, like the fiddleback spider, being as it is 'the quality or state of being sentimental to excess or in affectation.'

Which may be farther put beyond dispute by the following demonstration: that whoever will examine the writings in all kinds, wherewith this ancient sect has honoured the world, shall immediately find, from the whole thread and tenor of them, that the ideas of the authors have been altogether conversant and taken up with the faults and blemishes, and oversights, and mistakes of other writers; and let the subject treated on be whatever it will, their imaginations are so entirely possessed and replete with the defects of other pens, that the very quintessence of what is bad does of necessity distil into their own, by which means the whole appears to be nothing else but an abstract of the criticisms themselves have made.": "Jonathan",
  "In his book Real Presences, George Steiner asks us to \"imagine a society in which all talk about the arts, music and literature is prohibited.\" In such a society there would be no more essays on whether Hamlet was mad or only pretending to be, no reviews of the latest exhibitions or novels, no profiles of writers or artists. There would be no secondary, or parasitic, discussion - let alone tertiary: commentary on commentary. We would have, instead, a \"republic for writers and readers\" with no cushion of professional opinion-makers to come between creators and audience. While the Sunday papers presently serve as a substitute for the experiencing of the actual exhibition or book, in Steiner's imagined republic the review pages would be turned into listings:catalogues and guides to what is about to open, be published, or be released. What would this republic be like? Would the arts suffer from the obliteration of this ozone of comment? Certainly not, says Steiner, for each performance of a Mahler symphony is also a critique of that symphony. Unlike the reviewer, however, the performer \"invests his own being in the process of interpretation.\" Such interpretation is automatically responsible because the performer is answerable to the work in a way that even the most scrupulous reviewer is not. Although, most obviously, it is not only the case for drama and music; all art is also criticism. This is most clearly so when a writer or composer quotes or reworks material from another writer or composer. All literature, music, and art \"embody an expository reflection which they pertain\". In other words it is not only in their letters, essays, or conversation that writers like Henry James reveal themselves also to be the best critics; rather, The Portrait of a Lady is itself, among other things, a commentary on and a critique of Middlemarch. \"The best readings of art are art.\"No sooner has Steiner summoned this imaginary republic into existence than he sighs, \"The fantasy I have sketched is only that.\" Well, it is not. It is a real place and for much of the century it has provided a global home for millions of people. It is a republic with a simple name: jazz.": "Geoff",

  "How is he made? Oftentimes bitter, sometimes sweet, seldom even wide-awake, architectural criticism of \"the modern\" wholly lacks inspiration or any qualification because it lacks the appreciation that is love: the flame essential to profound understanding. Only as criticism is the fruit of such experience will it ever be able truly to appraise anything. Else the spirit of true criteria is lacking. That spirit is love and love alone can understand. So art criticism is usually sour and superficial today because it would seem to know all about everything but understand nothing. Usually the public prints afford no more than a kind of irresponsible journalese wholly dependent upon some form of comparison, commercialization or pseudo-personal opinion made public. Critics may have minds of their own, but what chance have they to use them when experience in creating the art they write about is rarely theirs? So whatever they may happen to learn, and you learn from them, is very likely to put over on both of you as it was put over on them.

  "This philistinism of interpretation is more rife in literature than in any other art. For decades now, literary critics have understood it to be their task to translate the elements of the poem or play or novel or story into something else. Sometimes a writer will be so uneasy before the naked power of his art that he will install within the work itself - albeit with a little shyness, a touch of the good taste of irony - the clear and explicit interpretation of it. Thomas Mann is an example of such an overcooperative author. In the case of more stubborn authors, the critic is only too happy to perform the job.": "Susan",

  "Have you ever wondered what it feels like to have a love for the lost? This is a term we use as part of our Christian jargon. Many believers search their hearts in condemnation, looking for the arrival of some feeling of benevolence that will propel them into bold evangelism. It will never happen. It is impossible to love \u201cthe lost\u201d. You can\u2019t feel deeply for an abstraction or a concept. You would find it impossible to love deeply an unfamiliar individual portrayed in a photograph, let alone a nation or a race or something as vague as \u201call lost people\u201d.Don\u2019t wait for a feeling or love in order to share Christ with a stranger. You already love your heavenly Father, and you know that this stranger is created by Him, but separated from Him, so take those first steps in evangelism because you love God. It is not primarily out of compassion for humanity that we share our faith or pray for the lost; it is first of all, love for God.": "John",

  "Up until the 1950s the subject of the missionary movement was referred to as \"missions\" in the plural form. In fact, the term \"missions\" was first used in its current context by the Jesuits in the sixteenth century. But the International Missionary Council discussions in the 1950s on the missio- Dei convinced most that the mission of the Triune God was prior to any of the number of missions by Christians during the two millennia of church history. Consequently, since there was only one mission, the plural form has dropped out of familir usage and the singular form, \"mission,\" has replaced it for the most part. Nevertheless, most churches and lay-persons hang on the plural missions.

The literature on the subject is pretty unanimous in its opinion that the Soviet system had taken a poorly designed reactor adn then staffed it with a group of incompetents. It then proceeded, as the interviews in this book attest, to lie about the disaster in the most criminal way. In the crucial first ten days, when the reactor core was burning and releasing a steady stream of highly radioactive material into the surrounding areas, the authorities repeatedly claimed that the situation was under control. . . In the week after the accident, while refusing to admit to the world that anything really serious had gone wrong, the Soviets poured thousands of men into the breach. . .

Maybe it was the fear that her arms would pass right through him, that she would have come all this way only to find a ghost after all.As though he\u2019d been able to read her thoughts, he slowly angled toward her. He raised his hands and held his palms out to her. Isobel lifted her own hands to mirror his. He pressed their palms together, his fingers folding down to lace through hers.

Isobel winced, her own hands surrendering under the suddenly crushing pressure of his hold. A face she did not recognize stared down at her, one twisted with anger \u2014 with hate.\"You,\" he scarcely more than breathed, \"are just like every. Body. Else.\"He moved so fast. Before she could register his words or the fact that she had once spoken them to him herself, he jerked her to one side. Isobel felt her feet part from the rocks. Weightlessness took hold of her as she swung out and over the ledge of the cliff.As he let her go.The wind whistled its high and lonely song in her ears.

A sexy woman knows herself and she likes the way she looks, thinks & feels. She doesn't try to change to match anybody else. She's a good friend herself kind and patient. and she knows how to use her words to tell people she trusts about what's going on inside of her-her fears and anger, love, dreams the mistakes, and needs. When she's angry she expresses her anger in healthy ways. When she's joyful, she does the same thing. She doesn't hide her true self because she is not ashamed. She knows she's just human-exactly how God made her and that's good enough. She's brave enough to be honest and kind enough to except others when they're honest. When two people are sexy enough to be brave and kind with each other, that's love. Sexy is more about how you feel and how you look.

Give them whatever they want, champagne, the caviar drizzled in hash oil, anything. Even my own stuff to smoke from the crystal bong I got in Paris to the vape pen done in pearl. They need to be impressed.": "Kenya",
  "When I arrived at her door, with the weight of the entire world on my shoulders, she drew me into her arms and eased all my stress away. She comforted and spent time with me when she didn\u2019t have to. She didn\u2019t know me at all, had no idea who I was or what I intended for her, whether passion or pain. But her heart led her forward, that beautiful heart I wanted for myself. So when the moment came to kiss her, as we stood in the water at the beach, I seized it like a desperate man. I was a mad one on the edge of insanity and she was the tonic I needed.": "Kenya",
  "Annabel,\u201d I whispered in her ear, making sure not to touch her. Her heartbeat accelerated, her skin got the chills, and her pupils dilated, not to mention how delicious she smelled and how the excitement only increased the scent. My own body got tense and aroused. \u201cLet your guard down and trust me. Nothing will happen that you don\u2019t want to happen. I\u2019m not trying to get you drunk or trick you. I just want to get to know you better.\u201d\u201cShane,\u201d she replied with her sexy, hot, and alluring voice that sent spirals of lust down my spine. \u201cI have nothing against sleeping with you. I\u2019m fully dressed for that.": "Anna",
  "She'd never stood a chance. She was a good girl, raised on the bible and charm school. She was destined to long for the thrill of the unattainable and nobody was more unattainable to a good girl than the bad boy.": "Jess",
  "Are you both drunk?\u201d I headed up the ladder and propped myself on a swing with no problem. \u201cCorrection, dear brother.\u201d Hex held one finger in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re exquisitely tipsy. There\u2019s a difference. Drunkenness is done at a shady bar, in ugly clothing, surrounded by the mundane. While exquisite tipsiness is performed in an art setting among geniuses.\u201d\u201cThanks so much for the distinction.\u201d I rolled my eyes.": "Kenya",
  "Because they\u2019re wet, Noah\u2019s jeans are a bit stubborn sliding down, but he\u2019s successful, and in the mirror I\u2019m drawn to his naked body. I love the raw power of his shoulder blades and the curve of his back that trails lower to his...my mouth dries out...oh, crap...his butt is...how do I describe something so exquisite?Everything about Noah is sexy, and as he bends to pull the jeans off his f": "Katie",
  "But you just got laid. Very well, I might add. Isn\u2019t that enough to tide you over for a while?\u201d\u201cMaybe for a woman. But if a man doesn\u2019t use the goods, they shrivel up\u2014\u201dShe rolled her eyes.\u201c\u2014and now that I\u2019ve realized what I\u2019ve been missing, and you\u2019ve done such a great job getting me back up on the horse, for which I\u2019m immensely grateful, then I think I\u2019m ready to spread my wings.\u201d He motioned to the wing spreading area. His groin. \u201cThis really shouldn\u2019t go to waste, now, should it?": "Kate",
  "She looked at his outstretched hand, seeing it for what it was. A challenge. An invitation. A promise. They could never be just a \"fling.\" A fling was something you didn't put your heart into.": "J.K.",
  "He liked confidence in a woman. And intelligence. And apparently he liked sass, all wrapped up in a straight-laced, tight-lipped bodyguard.": "J.K.",
  "She squeezed her thighs together, desperate for relief. Aiming for completion without doing something so deliberate as touching herself. Look ma, no hands!": "Kate",
  "He was struck dumb by her brilliant blue eyes. Eyes that could drag a man out of the darkest hole and into the light.": "J.K.",
  "I didn\u2019t understand what was supposed to happen from our swinging, but the need to make her happy bloomed in my chest.": "Kenya",
  "Are you both drunk?\u201d I headed up the ladder and propped myself on a swing with no problem. \u201cCorrection, dear brother.\u201d Hex held one finger in the air. \u201cWe\u2019re exquisitely tipsy.": "Kenya",
  "I love this smell,\u201d she said, squeezing him.\u201cWhat smell?\u201d\u201cYou\u2026us. It has a life of its own. Should bottle it.\u201d\u201cNo way. I\u2019m not selling us.": "Nancy",
  "Art isn\u2019t a means for income when it comes to Hex. He would do it if he was trapped on an island by himself or the richest man in the world. For him, art is like breathing. He just has to do it.": "Kenya",
  "Their faces showed beautiful smiles boasting magnificent teeth. Their skin gleamed in the perfect lighting. Even their scarred flesh seemed to hold its own intricate designs, as crazy as it seemed. Luscious curves still decorated their hips and the swell between their legs. They were striking and endearing like a tribe of taunting sirens on top of a cliff in the middle of the sea. I gazed at them for longer than I should have\u2026": "Kenya",
  "Nothing is bigger than art.": "Kenya",
  "I know you've been through an ordeal, but you don\u2019t want to start drowning yourself in liquor. You\u2019ll find that it\u2019s easy to do, but by the time you realize it could start to be a problem, you\u2019re already over that cliff.": "Kenya",
  "We all came to watch her die.": "Kenya",

  "What made a movie buff different from others was the amount of freakish details they chose to fill their heads with. The typical movie-goer remembered the big lines, the ones that you could find on the film\u2019s shirts and posters. Just a bunch of tag-lines used for promotion. A true movie buff memorized the odd ones that said more about the story\u2019s theme or characters. A true buff read up on the movie\u2019s history.": "Kenya",
  "\u2026I craved to stroke that delicate skin and run my fingers through her tresses as she moaned with hunger. I would grip a thick section of her hair in my hands, wrap it around my fingers, and take her from behind. And she would scream my name.": "Kenya",
  "I got your flowers. They\u2019re beautiful, thank you.\u201d A gorgeous riot of Gerber daisies and lilies in a rainbow of reds, pinks, yellows and oranges. \u201cWelcome. Bet Duncan loved sending one of his guys out to pick them up for me.\u201d She could hear the smile in his voice, imagined the devilish twinkle in his eyes. \u201cOh, he did. Said it\u2019s probably the first time in the history of WITSEC that a U.S. Marshal delivered flowers to one of their witnesses.\u201d A low chuckle. \u201cWell, this was a special circumstance, so they helped me out.\u201d \u201cI loved the card you sent with them the best though.\u201d Proud of you. Give \u2018em hell tomorrow. He\u2019d signed it Nathan rather than Nate, which had made her smile. \u201cI had no idea you were romantic,\u201d she continued. \u201cAll these interesting things I\u2019m learning about you.\u201d She hadn\u2019t been able to wipe the silly smile off her face after one of the security team members had knocked on her door and handed them to her with a goofy smile and a, \u201cspecial delivery\u201d. \u201cBaby, you haven\u2019t seen anything yet. When the trial\u2019s done you\u2019re gonna get all the romance you can handle, and then some.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Now that was something for a girl to look forward to, and it sure as hell did the trick in taking her mind off her worries. \u201cWell I\u2019m all intrigued, because it\u2019s been forever since I was romanced. What do you have in mind? Candlelit dinners? Going to the movies? Long walks? Lazy afternoon picnics?\u201d \u201cNot gonna give away my hand this early on, but I\u2019ll take those into consideration.\u201d \u201cAnd what\u2019s the key to your heart, by the way? I mean, other than the thing I did to you this morning.\u201d \u201cWhat thing is that? Refresh my memory,\u201d he said, a teasing note in his voice. She smiled, enjoying the light banter. It felt good to let her worry about tomorrow go and focus on what she had to look forward to when this was all done. Being with him again, seeing her family, getting back to her life. A life that would hopefully include Nathan in a romantic capacity. \u201cWaking you up with my mouth.\u201d He gave a low groan. \u201cI loved every second of it. But think simpler.\u201d Simpler than sex? For a guy like him? \u201cFood, then. I bet you\u2019re a sucker for a home-cooked meal. Am I right?\u201d He chuckled. \u201cThat works too, but it\u2019s still not the key.\u201d \u201cThen what?\u201d \u201cYou.\u201d She blinked, her heart squeezing at the conviction behind his answer. \u201cMe?\u201d \u201cYeah, just you. And maybe bacon,\u201d he added, a smile in his voice. He was so freaking adorable. \u201cSo you\u2019re saying if I made and served you a BLT, you\u2019d be putty in my hands?\u201d Seemed hard to imagine, but okay. A masculine rumble filled her ears. \u201cGod, yeah.\u201d She couldn\u2019t help the sappy smile that spread across her face. \u201cWow, you are easy. And I can definitely arrange that.\u201d \u201cI can hardly wait. Will you serve it to me naked? Or maybe wearing just a frilly little apron and heels?\u201d She smothered a laugh, but a clear image of her doing just that popped into her head, serving him the sandwich in that sexy outfit while watching his eyes go all heated. \u201cDepends on how good you are.\u201d \u201cOh, baby, I\u2019ll be so good to you, you have no idea.": "Kaylea",
  "Oh my God. It is your nookie box. How many times have you had sex on that blanket?\u201d\u201cNever, you sicko. I make them stand.\u201d \u201cAsshole.": "J.",
  "Her body didn\u2019t give a damn that he was all wrong for her, it wanted him anyway. Badly. Either oblivious of or not wanting to encourage the attraction between them, Wade looked down at his mug as though he wasn\u2019t comfortable holding her gaze at such close range, and took a sip. As he swallowed, one side of his mouth curved up and he let out an appreciative groan that seemed to reverberate right through her, heating her blood. Startled, she drank in the almost dreamy expression on his angular face and imagined that same look right after he\u2019d enjoyed an intensely satisfying orgasm. Erin couldn\u2019t be positive, but if his reaction to a simple cup of coffee made him groan like that, she was pretty sure it had been a while since he\u2019d had one of those, too. And man, the idea of being the one to end his dry spell was way too freaking hot for her own good.": "Kaylea",
  "You shouldn\u2019t kiss me like that unless it means something to you.\u201d Max\u2019s lip trembled beneath her thumb. A deep groan rose from his chest. And then he was pushing to his feet, pulling her with him. His mouth covered hers, hot and wet and full of a driving need she answered kiss for kiss.": "Julie",
  "Hey, she was his fantasy girl. She was supposed to act in an appropriate fantasy-like manner. She wasn\u2019t supposed to look at him as though he was all her nightmares rolled up into one big pile of dog crap that she couldn\u2019t wait to scrape off her sensible shoes. And that was only after she\u2019d finally recognized him\u2014which had taken far longer than it should have done considering they\u2019d had hot, mind-blowing sex every night for a year...In his dreams.": "Nina",
  "He almost didn\u2019t want to start. He\u2019d been fantasizing about this for so long. What if it was a disappointment? What if he couldn\u2019t make her come? In his fantasies, she\u2019d come for him hard and frequently, usually screaming his name.": "Nina",
  "Is this another fantasy?\u201d she asked.His gaze lifted to her face. His expression was serious, his usual amusement absent. \u201cNo. This is real. This is you and me. Just once, and afterwards I\u2019ll leave you alone. I promise I won\u2019t hold you back. Now, I\u2019m going to make love to you, slowly and completely, and you\u2019ll never forget the feel of me inside you.": "Nina",
  "Sounds like this ability stuff went okay with Shane after all. I had no idea that he would react like that,\u201d Noah said.\u201cYeah, well, it helps when he wants to rip Nessa\u2019s clothes off,\u201d I said grinning.\u201cHey, I might just let him. He is pretty hot,\u201d Nessa joked.-Noah, Cora and Nessa": "Andrea",
  "He leveled his gaze on her\u2014the intensity there whispering promises she couldn\u2019t fathom\u2014and she shivered.": "Katherine",
  "A wicked curve appears on his lips. \u201cNo, you\u2019re wrong. I\u2019m allowed to say whatever I want. What I\u2019m not allowed to do is what I want.": "Alex",
  "We told Mom about the Anne Frank House, leaving out the kissing.\"Did you go back to chez Van Houten afterward?\" Mom asked.Augustus didn't even give me time to blush.\"Nah, we just hung out at a caf\u00e9. Hazel amused me with some Venn diagram humor.\"He glanced at me. God, he was sexy.": "John",
  "Staying level with Tess was going to require fast thinking, which was mighty difficult considering all the blood he needed for said thought processes was now hurtling south.\u201cWhat would this job involve?\u201d\u201cOnly one task. Make. Me. Believe.\u201d\u201cThat I\u2019m your fianc\u00e9?\u201dCue her smile, sly and sexy. First time she\u2019d let him in on that action, too. \u201cThat you want me more than your next breath.\u201dIf she moved forward a couple of inches, his boner would make her believe.": "Kate",
  "I could just as easily have taken the train.\u201dHe shut his eyes, just long enough for a movie of a Tess-induced train riot to screen on the backs of his eyelids. Fists flying, teeth broken, friendships destroyed as men vied to get closer to her lush body barely covered in that incendiary French maid outfit. And now he was turning hard again.": "Kate",
  "It's hot out there.\" I prowl toward her, pulling off my shirt. I maybe flex my abs a little- anything for my girl.": "Ainsley",
  "Automatically, I eyed her slim, full-breasted figure and swallowed. For a junkie, this girl was put together. For anybody, this girl was put together.": "Michael",
  "You can't cover up the swagger of a cowboy.": "Jaycee",
  "What can I do to get you out of your shirt today, Luke?\u201d Her voice held a husky, wheeler-dealer tone, the kind of voice for which he was likely to do anything. He imagined that voice whispering in his ear, issuing wicked orders, making him hard as steel.": "Kate",
  "He moved closer to her, his face just inches away from her. They stood motionless. Jason looked deep into her eyes. He tore away her barriers and locked eyes. His nose two inches away, he slightly tilted his face and looked at her lips. She slightly turned her face at the opposite angle.": "Mark",
  "I don\u2019t want another to love you, Because I wanted you for myself. I've never stopped loving you. Never stopped wanting you. Every second of every day, my heart has always been yours.": "Jessica",
  "I might have been a little mesmerized for a moment as I took in the sight of her shapely backside. It was incredible. I just wanted to spank it and bite it and worship it and completely fucking defile it.": "Penny",
  "The protector inside me was frowning while the predator soaked up her discomfort with glee.": "Penny",
  "Nolan crossed his arms; he had his gorgeous frowny face on. \"Don't you trust me?\"Raina looked at him incredulously. \"Of course I trust you...undoubtedly.\" She felt her spine stiffen in defiance of her friend\u2019s assumption. She'd like to prove her wrong!A slow sexy grin tugged at his lips. \"Then take a ride on my bike, Aelan.": "Sarah",
  "Whatcha do to Ricky Ricardo? Found him talking real fast in Spanish.\" \"Nothing.\" She looked at Tony. \"He's just moody, and the moodier he gets, the less you can understand him.": "Sidney",
  "Why is it so sexy when hot guys stare each other down like that? Why do I feel like licking the air? Am I ovulating?": "Nicole",
  "You may not mean to, but you do seem to look down your nose at many of us mere mortals muddling along down here. I feel as though you think everyone should be better than they are. I certainly think you expect me to behave like some sort of perfect princess. But I\u2019m just an ordinary girl who wants to grow up and find out where I belong in the world.": "Emily",
  "I loved begging him, following his rules. I loved the freedom I found in complete capitulation.": "Penny",
  "The women I\u2019m attracted to have to know their worth. That measurement can only be weighed from the inside, and when that\u2019s taken into account and she truly appreciates it? Everything on the outside of her becomes an asset.": "Riley",
  "A single bead of water rolled along the length of his spine and glided down the powerful lines of his body. Mariel moistened her lips and watched its seductive descent, overwhelmed with the temptation to trace its path with the tip of her tongue.": "Madeline",

  "I`m the second sexist person, one behind you.": "Sebastian",

  "I judged you unfairly when I met you.\u201d\u201cBut you still wanted to kiss me?\u201dHe shrugged, a smirk turning up the right corner of his mouth. \u201cI\u2019m a guy.": "Katrina",
  "I'm yours, Savoie. I always have been. Take me, claim me. Know again in your heart and mind that we're one in all things.": "Nancy",
  "He felt torn. He wanted her to feel safe with him, but he also wanted her to feel the sort of heady excitement that any young girl should feel when they fall in love. He wanted to give her everything she craved, and he was not quite sure he could do it.": "Emily",
  "Have I told you that you are my every dream?\"Her eyes shimmered. Her voice went smoky with emotion. \"Not recently.": "Nancy",

  "Detective, any warm-blooded male with a pulse would have his hand on your glorious ass. May I?\"\"Knock yourself out.\"His fingertips sketched over that tight sheen of Lycra before cupping a taut globe for a squeeze. \"What kind of workout do you do to get that kind of muscle tone?\"She put her face up close to his. \"I beat the shit outta guys who grab my ass.": "Nancy",

I couldn\u2019t think.\u201cThree reasons. One, I don\u2019t want to get into an accident trying to keep my eyes on you. Two, if I got into an accident, or if we were pulled over for indecent exposure, the mood killing would be the least of our problems.

  "Everything melts away. All that I know is this kiss; all that I feel is his lips pressing into mine. I become dizzy from want, need, and the lack of oxygen. Our lips, our bodies, our souls, have always fit perfectly together\u2014like two pieces of a puzzle.Alexia GrantMore Layers": "T.L.",

  "Fin,\" she whispered. \"What do you need?\" He covered her hand, right there in her lap, then let go quickly and dipped his head to try to meet her downcast eyes. He smelled so good--like intrigue and dubious morality. It sent a delicious shiver down her arms.": "Lauren",
  "I think you still love me,\u2019 he says, \u2018even though you don\u2019t want to.\u2019I glare at him, fury battling my instincts.\u2018Because that kind of love, Jessa,\u2019 Kit continues, \u2018doesn\u2019t just disappear. It doesn\u2019t just fade. I still love you. I\u2019ll always love you. And I think you feel the same way about me. And hell, I know I don\u2019t deserve it. I know all I deserve is your hatred. But if there\u2019s a chance, a single chance that you might still love me, then I\u2019m not going to throw it away.

  "Wyatt should\u2019ve looked ridiculous sitting on the floor, leaning into the crate makingkissykiss noises at the cat, but he didn\u2019t.

The most that could be said was that she did not have much further to go before she would have to start squeezing it in and strapping it up, which she clearly did not do now. She let it hang where it was, and it did very nicely by itself. As she passed among the boys they looked her over with unconcealed envy, as though they knew she had something they didn't have but were not quite sure what it was. One thing was certain, she got more exercise than they did.The next to be noticed were her braids, they hung forward over her terrain, ignoring as much as possible her contours, like two shiny black meridianal lines demarking her longitudes as far down as the equator. It was not hard to imagine oneself spending a long lifetime on that bare little island alone, with no plan or ambition, too overcome with the heat to continue on south to the pole, far less return to the continents. Nothing productive could ever be accomplished there, but there would be comfort such as few men have known, there would be torpor. The body swelled with such thoughts, the mind shrank from them, and the longing eyes traveled finally up north, to where those meridians came together at a point above a bland white area vaguely charted, with few landmarks, no doubt sparsely inhabited.

  "I woke up dead.Not only dead...but in hell.I had always been somewhat sketchy on what the afterlife - were there actually such a thing - would be like for a person such as I. From all accounts and all my imaginings, I figured it would be one of two things. Either I would be surrounded by great, burning masses that were endlessly immolating souls in torment... or else I would find myself trapped within my own mind as a helpless bystander, condemned to watching me live out my life over and over again and powerless to do anything to change any of it. When idle speculation prompted me to dwell on these two options, I would find myself drawn invariably to the former, since the later was just too hideous to contemplate....I was almost afraid to open my eyes, because once I did, I would know one way or the other. Perhaps I could have just lain there forever. Perhaps I was supposed to. Perhaps that was my true condemnation: to simply reside in hell with my eyes closed afraid of opening them lest matters deteriorate even further than they already had. This, in turn, made me dwell on the fact that every time I had believed things couldn\u2019t get worse, they promptly had done so with almost gleeful enthusiasm .": "Peter",

  "Here it is necessary briefly to consider the question of the cult of ancestors before venturing farther. The spirits of the departed are believed to be possessed of supernatural powers which they did not enjoy in the flesh. They may also be dissatisfied or malignant in consequence of being suddenly deprived of life, and if they are neglected by the living, are apt to be revengeful. Therefore they must be cajoled and propitiated. Fear of beings belonging to a mysterious state or sphere of which he knew nothing continually haunted and terrified primitive man and induced in him what is known as\" the dread of the sacred.\" It was every man's personal duty to attend to the demands or requirements of his deceased ancestors. At first he would succour his own immediate forebears with food and gifts; but it must have been borne in upon him that when his parents joined the great majority, the care of the spirits of their parents likewise devolved upon him... and, by degrees, he might even come to regard himself as responsible for the well-being of a line of spirit ancestors of quite formidable genealogy. These, through his neglect, might starve in their tombs; or, alternatively, they might crave his company. Because of vengeance or loneliness they might send disease upon him, for the savage almost invariably believes illness to be brought about by the action of jealous or neglected ancestors. The loneliness of the spirit-world is the dead man's greatest excuse for desiring the company of his descendants.": "Lewis",

  "She stood in his kitchen, watching him toy with the ring in his lip. It wasn't quite that he was biting it, but sucking it into his mouth. He did that when he was concentrating. It isn't sexy. He's not sexy. But he was, and she was staring at him like a fool. \"wow\" she whispered (.....)\"Wow, huh?\" His voice was low, husky. His chair creaked as he stood. His footsteps seemed strangely loud as he closed the couple yards between them. Then he was beside her. \"I can work with wow": "Melissa",
  "Look at the time.\" I tipped my chin toward the clock. \"It's past midnight. It's January second. You lost.\"For several moments he stared at the clock like it was an Arum he was about to blast into the next county and then his eyes found mine. Daemon smiled. \"No. I didn't lose. I still won.": "Jennifer",
  "Okay, this was kissing. Serious kissing. Not just a kiss before moving out, not a good-bye, this was Hello, sexy, and wow, she\u2019d never even suspected that it could feel this way.": "Rachel",
  "I'm not ill like that,\u201d she groaned. He sat on her bed, peeling back the blanket. A servant entered, frowning at the mess on the floor, and shouted for help.\u201cThen it what way?\u201d\u201cI,uh...\u201d Her face was so hot she thought it would melt onto the floor. Oh you idiot. \u201cMy monthly cycles finally came back!\u201dHis face suddenly matched hers and he stepped away, dragging his hand through his short hair. \u201cI-if...Then I'll take my leave,\u201d he stammered, and bowed. Celaena raised an eyebrow, and then, despite herself, smiled as he left the room as quick as his feet could go without running, tripping slightly in the doorway as he staggered into the rooms beyond.": "Sarah",
  "Claire. Wake up.\u201d She blinked and realized that her head was on Shane\u2019s shoulder, and Michael was nowhere to be seen. Her first thought was, Oh my God, am I drooling? Her second was that she hadn\u2019t realized she was so close to him, snuggled in. Her third was that although Michael\u2019s part of the couch was empty, Shane hadn\u2019t moved away. And he was watching her with warm, friendly eyes. Oh. Oh, wow, that was nice.": "Rachel",
  "I wrote about the person I love most, my older brother, Noah. We don't live together so I wrote what I imagine he does when we're not together.\"\"And what is that?\" prodded the stout man. \"He's a superhero who saves people in danger, because he saved me and my brother from dying in a fire a couple of years ago. Noah is better than Batman.\" The crowd chuckled. \"I love you, too, lil'bro.": "Katie",
  "His blue-black hair fell over his face when he moved, like tiny arrows pointing to pronounced cheeckbones. \"Starting to think you were going to bail on me.\" \"Didn't know you were expecting me,\" she said in what she hoped was a casual voice. He gets sexier every day. \"Not Expecting, but hoping. Always hoping": "Melissa",

Harsh language?\u201dI leaned over to kiss his neck once, and then ran my tongue up to his ear, kissing his earlobe. He froze in place. \u201cDistraction,\u201d I breathed into his ear.

I didn\u2019t know what alone was until the first night I spent without you in my bed. You\u2019re the one thing I\u2019ve got right. You\u2019re what I\u2019ve been waiting for, Pigeon.": "Jamie",

  "You scared the shit out of me last night, so forgive me if I don't want to hear fine as an answer.\"I rubbed my eyes, hoping it would keep the burning tears away. The warm water of the shower had finally calmed the tears, but the thought of Noah walking away brought them back. \"What do you want to hear? That I'm exhausted? Terrified? Confused? That all I want to do is rest my head on your chest and sleep for hours, but that's not going to happen because you're leaving me?\"\"Yes,\" he said quickly, then just as quick said, \"No. Everything but the last part.\" He paused. \"Echo, how could you think I would leave you? How can you doubt how I feel?\"\"Because,\" I said as I felt the familiar twisting in my stomach. \"You saw me lose it. You saw me almost go insane.\"The muscles in his shoulders visibly tensed. \"I watched you battle against the worst memory of your life and I watched you win. Make no mistake, Echo. I battled right beside you. You need to find some trust in me ... in us.\"Noah inhaled and slowly let the air out. His stance softened and so did his voice. \"If you're scared, tell me. If you need to cry and scream, then do it. And you sure as hell don't walk away from us because you think it would be better for me. Here's the reality, Echo: I want to be by your side. If you want to go to the mall stark naked so you can show the world your scars, then let me hold your hand. If you want to see your mom, then tell me that, too.

  "Dear Max - You looked so beautiful today. I'm going to remember what you looked like forever.... And I hope you remember me the same way - clean, ha-ha. I'm glad our last time together was happy.But I'm leaving tonight, leaving the flock, and this time it's for good. I don't know if I'll ever see any of you again. The thing is, Max, that everyone is a little bit right. Added up all together, it makes this one big right.Dylan's a little bit right about how my being here might be putting the rest of you in danger. The threat might have been just about Dr. Hans, but we don't know that for sure. Angel is a little bit right about how splitting up the flock will help all of us survive. And the rest of the flock is a little bit right about how when you and I are together, we're focused on each other - we can't help it.The thing is, Maximum, I love you. I can't help but be focused on you when we're together. If you're in the room, I want to be next to you. If you're gone, I think about you. You're the one who I want to talk to. In a fight, I want you at my back. When we're together, the sun is shining. When we're apart, everything is in shades of gray.I hope you'll forgive me someday for turning our worlds into shades of gray - at least for a while....You're not at your best when you're focused on me. I mean, you're at your best Maxness, but not your best leaderness. I mostly need Maxness. The flock mostly needs leaderness. And Angel, if you're listening to this, it ain't you, sweetie. Not yet....At least for a couple more years, the flock needs a leader to survive, no matter how capable everyone thinks he or she is. The truth is that they do need a leader, and the truth is that you are the best leader. It's one of the things I love about you.But the more I thought about it, the more sure I got that this is the right thing to do. Maybe not for you, or for me, but for all of us together, our flock.Please don't try to find me. This is the hardest thing I've ever done in my life, besides wearing that suit today, and seeing you again will only make it harder. You'd ask me to come back, and I would, because I can't say no to you. But all the same problems would still be there, and I'd end up leaving again, and then we'd have to go through this all over again.Please make us only go through this once....I love you. I love your smile, your snarl, your grin, your face when you're sleeping. I love your hair streaming out behind you as we fly, with the sunlight making it shine, if it doesn't have too much mud or blood in it. I love seeing your wings spreading out, white and brown and tan and speckled, and the tiny, downy feathers right at the top of your shoulders. I love your eyes, whether they're cold or calculating or suspicious or laughing or warm, like when you look at me....You're the best warrior I know, the best leader. You're the most comforting mom we've ever had. You're the biggest goofball, the worst driver, and a truly lousy cook. You've kept us safe and provided for us, in good times and bad. You're my best friend, my first and only love, and the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, with wings or without....Tell you what, sweetie: If in twenty years we haven't expired yet, and the world is still more or less in one piece, I'll meet you at the top of that cliff where we first met the hawks and learned to fly with them. You know the one. Twenty years from today, if I'm alive, I'll be there, waiting for you. You can bet on it.Good-bye, my love.FangP.S. Tell everyone I sure will miss them": "James",

  "Getting up, Luc finished his beer and set the empty bottle on the small outdoor table. The sooner he apologised for his outburst, the better. Walking into the house, he heard a thud. Panic filled him as he ran towards the back of the house.He rounded the corner and almost ran over Justin. His partner had evidently been trying to get to his wheelchair. \"Baby? What're you doing?\" Luc asked. Kneeling on the floor, he pulled Justin into his arms.\"Coming after you,\" Justin said. \"I'm...sorry.\"Luc held Justin tighter as his lover began to shake.

  "Young friends, whose string-and-tin-can phone extended from island to island, had to pay out more and more string, as if letting kites go higher and higher. They had more and more to tell each other, and less and less string. The boy asked the girl to say \"I love you\" into her can, giving her no further explanation. And she didn't ask for any, or say \"That's silly,\" or \"We're too young for love,\" or even suggest that she was saying \"I love you\" because he asked her to. Instead she said, \"I love you.\" The words traveled through the long, long string. The boy covered his can with a lid, removed it from the string, and put her love for him on a shelf in his closet. Of course, he never could open the can, because then he would lose its contents. It was enough just to know it was there.": "Jonathan",

Like how I thought she was awesome, bad-ass ninja, and what I hated was the fact that I knew I couldn't protect her, when that's all I wanted to do. How could I explain, without sounding like a complete asshole, that I was so afraid of losing her I pushed her away? I couldn't.": "Susan",

  "Opening the freezer, Easy smiled. God bless the Rixeys\u2019 ice-cream addiction. There were so many containers, it seemed entirely plausible that they\u2019d robbed an ice-cream delivery truck. He sorted through the tubs until he found a container of chocolate. Bingo. Next, he grabbed the milk from the fridge. And then he opened a bunch of cabinets until he found a blender at the back of one of them. The layer of dust on its surfaces told of how long it had gone unused. He rinsed and wiped it off, then brought the detachable pitcher to the other counter, where the ice cream lay waiting. Shane\u2019s expression was two seconds away from amused. \u201cNot a word, McCallan.\u201d He held up his hands and shook his head, but he couldn\u2019t hold back the smile. Fucker. Scoop, scoop, scoop, milk. Lid on, Easy placed the container on the blender and hit mix. Two minutes later, he had something approximating a very thick milk shake. He spooned it into a glass, then gathered the bagel and soup. Next he built his sandwich, sneaking pieces of beef and cheese as he worked. \u201cDamn, that looks good,\u201d Shane said, pushing off the stool and grabbing a plate for himself. \u201cThink I\u2019ll make some food for me and Sara, too.\u201d Easy suddenly felt less self-conscious with Shane making food for his woman, too. Whoa. He froze with a piece of rye bread in his hand. Jenna was not his woman. But maybe she could be. Slapping the bread on top of the lettuce, Easy\u2019s thoughts spun\u2014he came up with lots of reasons why it probably wasn\u2019t a good idea, but that didn\u2019t make him want it any less. Mid-sandwich-making, Shane spoke in low, even tones. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to do that thing where I tell you to handle Jenna with care if you\u2019re thinking of starting something with her, do we?\u201d For. Fuck. Sake. Not that Easy was particularly surprised by the question. Hadn\u2019t he been half expecting it? And, his brain noted with interest, it wasn\u2019t a warning off. \u201cNope.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t think so,\u201d Shane said in that same casual, even tone. \u201cI see how protective you are of her, Easy, and I\u2019m glad for that. I know you\u2019ll treat her right, so I\u2019m not saying a thing about it, except handle with care.\u201d Nodding, Easy concentrated on making the floor stand still under his feet. \u201cI like her, Shane,\u201d he finally said, echoing the conversation he and Shane had had a few nights ago about Shane\u2019s growing feelings for Sara. And, well, hi, how ya doin\u2019, Mr. Hypocrite, Easy had told Shane he had to come clean with the team. Despite the fact that Easy hadn\u2019t done so himself. Still. \u201cYeah,\u201d Shane said, clapping him on the back of the neck and squeezing. \u201cI know.\u201d Wow.From the thin cabinet next to the oven Easy retrieved a baking sheet to use as a tray. Improvisation he could do. He loaded it down with everything he thought they\u2019d need, lifted it into his arms and then he was all about getting back to Jenna.": "Laura",

  "When I lived in New York and went to Chinatown, I learned that these flavors and their meanings were actually a foundation of ancient Chinese medicine.Salty translated to fear and the frantic energy that tries to compensate for or hide it.Sweet was the first flavor we recognized from our mother's milk, and to which we turned when we were worried and unsure or depressed.Sour usually meant anger and frustration.Bitter signified matters of the heart, from simply feeling unloved to the almost overwhelming loss of a great love. Most spices, along with coffee and chocolate, had some bitterness in their flavor profile. Even sugar, when it cooked too long, turned bitter. But to me, spice was for grief, because it lingered longest.": "Judith",
  "Why are you here, Wesley?\u201d\u201cI told you,\u201d he said. \u201cI got worried. You\u2019ve been avoiding me for the past week at school, and when I called you today, you didn\u2019t answer. I thought something might have happened with your dad. So I came to make sure you were okay.\u201dI bit my lower lip, a wave of guilt washing over me. \u201cThat\u2019s sweet,\u201d I murmured. \u201cBut I\u2019m fine.

His words crashed into me, stunning me for a second. \u201cI\u2019ve been worried about you since you left my house a week ago! You didn\u2019t even say why you left, Bianca. What was I supposed to do? Just assume you would be all right?\u201d\u201cGod,\u201d I whispered. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.

You were always a little girl, like Izzy. Just a girl, skipping around, getting into trouble, and mouthing off. I never noticed you'd turned into a woman.\"Though the comprehension of the way he viewed her stung like the burn on her hand, she gave his broad chest beneath that worn-out gray Marines T-shirt an understanding pat with her unburned hand. \"I know.

I get it.\" Abby laughed. \"This is where you bid on someone to wash your car.\"\"Naked,\" Charli said.\"Or check the shower tiles.\"\"Also naked.\"Abby laughed. \"I'm guessing that as long as there's wet and naked, we're all good.\"Fiona let out a long sigh.\"What was that?\" Charli asked with a lift to her perfect brows. \"Have you got a victim---I mean a participant in mind?\"Fiona glanced across the hall. \"Have you seen Jackson's fireman buddy?\"\"No.\" Charli looked across the room. \"Should we?\"\"Too late,\" Fiona said. \"I've got first dibs.\"At that moment, Abby noticed the Wilder boys walk across the front of the room near the stage. Individually, they were stunning. As a group, they looked as appetizing as a decadent box of chocolates. Abby couldn't tear her eyes away from Jackson. Put him in a fireman suit, a tux jacket and jeans, or a simple T-shirt and cargo shorts, and he took her breath away.Truthfully, she liked him best in noting at all.\"Holy guacamole.\" Charli gestured to a tall, dark, and devastating man walking with the group. \"Is that who you are talking about?\"Fiona nodded. \"I want to lick him up one side and down the other like a cherry Popsicle.\"\"Honey, you bid as high as you can go,\" Charli said. \"And if you run out of money, you just let me know. I'd be happy to chip in.": "Candis",
  "Honey, when I look at you, you're right, I don't see anything similar to those other women. But don't you see? That's what makes you so special. That's why I love you.": "Carly",

  "A rumble gurgled through the space between them.\"Was that you?\"She looked down. \"Was that me?\"\"That noise. It sounded like a growl.\"Well according to you, I am a ferocious car burglar.": "Candis",
  "Her heart sprang up into her throat.Watching that shadow play was like paying a quarter for a peep show. Only she got it for free.He thinks I'm pretty.Butterflies did a dance around her heart before she could swat them away.Behind the shade. his shadow unbuttoned those soft, worn, butt-hugging jeans and slid them down his lean hips. Charli sucked in a big gulp of air, then headed back to the veranda and her glass of wine.With all the estrogen doing a conga line through her blood, she needed a drink.Well, she really needed something else.But she'd settle for a drink.": "Candis",
  "You are a moron.Jackson wanted to bash the message into his head. Because obviously his brain wasn't going to be of any help in the matter. And God knew his friend that lived behind the zipper of his jeans was clueless.": "Candis",
  "Thanks, you guys.\" Fiona smiled. \"I haven't been with anyone since Jackson and I split. I hate to act like such a hoochie mama, but---\"\"Hey. There's a little hoochie mama in all of us,\" Charli said. \"Didn't I tell you how I finally got Reno to make the big move?\"\"No.\"\"The famous Wilder barbecue party? While we were dancing, I conveniently told him I'd forgotten to put panties on under my dress. He could barely keep his hands to himself. Then I told him if he was interested, I'd meet him back at his house.\"\"Oooh, devious.\" Abby laughed. \"Was there any rubber left on his tires?\"\"Nope.\" Charli grinned. \"But that was one hoochie-mama move I'll never regret.": "Candis",
  "I just meant that a guy who's guarded his heart for so long might not be in the best position to judge.\"\"Ouch.\"\"Sorry.\" She reached across the cab of the truck and caressed his arm. \"I promise to take the sting out of that owie remark as soon as I get you naked.\"A grin shot to his face. \"Now you're talkin' my kind of language.": "Candis",

  "A gray V-neck T-shirt hugged his wide shoulders and broad chest, then hung loose over his tight abdomen. a pair of worn Levi's lovingly cupped his generous package, embraced long legs, and broke across the tops of well-worn cowboy boots. Jackson had the type of physique that made a woman's girl parts tingle. She'd have to be dead not to include herself in that party. Especially since her girl parts had been told \"No\" way too many time sin recent years.": "Candis",

  "My dearest Mary,Both my words and my conduct at our last meeting were ungentlemanly - born of haste and high emotion, rather than friendship and good judgement - and yet I cannot find it within me to apologize. I am glad I kissed you; glad to have revelled in your scent, your taste, the touch of your hands; glad, even, to have quarrelled with you because during those moments of anger, I was in your presence.Mary, you are the most singular woman I know: intelligent, brave and honest, and I crave your friendship. I confess to only the haziest notion of what I ask, having never been friends with a woman before. My friendships are male and conventional; pleasant and without distinction. But a friendship with you would be a bright, new, rare thing - if you would do me the honour.I expect that what I ask is impossible. But it is sweet to dream, Mary, and thus I tender one last, insolent, unapologetic request: write to me only if you can say yes.Yours,James": "Y.S.",

Before he completely withdrew, I took his hand and interlaced my fingers through his. He looked at me, his lips parted in surprise, but then he smiled shyly and gave my hand a squeeze as we kept walking. It gave me a feeling of nervous flutters in the best way.

He fed Petunia the other half so she wouldn't get cream on her knitting.

  "Dear Camryn,I never wanted it to be this way. I wanted to tell you these things myself, but I was afraid. I was afraid that if I told you out loud that I loved you, that what we had together would die with me. The truth is that I knew in Kansas that you were the one. I\u2019ve loved you since that day when I first looked up into your eyes as you glared down at me from over the top of that bus seat. Maybe I didn\u2019t know it then, but I knew something had happened to me in that moment and I could never let you go.I have never lived the way I lived during my short time with you. For the first time in my life, I\u2019ve felt whole, alive, free. You were the missing piece of my soul, the breath in my lungs, the blood in my veins. I think that if past lives are real then we have been lovers in every single one of them. I\u2019ve known you for a short time, but I feel like I\u2019ve known you forever.I want you to know that even in death I\u2019ll always remember you. I\u2019ll always love you. I wish that things could\u2019ve turned out differently. I thought of you many nights on the road. I stared up at the ceiling in the motels and pictured what our life might be like together if I had lived. I even got all mushy and thought of you in a wedding dress and even with a mini me in your belly. You know, I always heard that sex is great when you\u2019re pregnant. ;-)But I\u2019m sorry that I had to leave you, Camryn. I\u2019m so sorry\u2026I wish the story of Orpheus and Eurydice was real because then you could come to the Underworld and sing me back into your life. I wouldn\u2019t look back. I wouldn\u2019t fuck it up like Orpheus did.I\u2019m so sorry, baby\u2026I want you to promise me that you\u2019ll stay strong and beautiful and sweet and caring. I want you to be happy and find someone who will love you as much as I did. I want you to get married and have babies and live your life. Just remember to always be yourself and don\u2019t be afraid to speak your mind or to dream out loud.I hope you\u2019ll never forget me.One more thing: don\u2019t feel bad for not telling me that you loved me.

  "All I'm saying is I think you deserve better,\u201d Case said. \u201cFrom my point of view, anyway. You deserve better.\u201dI threw my head back on the sofa and laughed. It was a harsh laugh with no mirth. \u201cMost of the time, I don't think I deserve better.\u201d\u201cEveryone deserves better.\u201d\u201cNot me.\u201d I didn't look at him. \u201cNo one else would want me.

Anything or anyone.\u201d\u201cYeah, there is.\u201d \u201cOh, really?\u201d I brought my eyes back to him. \u201cAnd where exactly would I find better?\u201d It was quiet for a moment. Then he said,\u201cWell, you might start with me.": "Anna",
  "Why did you do this? You could lose your job or worse.\u201d \u201cI wanted to spend some time alone with you. Tomorrow, you might be leaving for good.\u201d He leaned down and pressed his lips to hers. Reluctantly, he pulled away. \u201cYou\u2019re worth the risk.": "Julia",
  "Every time you strip my sword, I owe you a kiss. How's that sound?\" I bit my lip to keep from giggling. \"That sounds really dirty.\" Patch waggled his brows. \"Look whose mind just rolled into the gutter.": "Becca",
  "Ready?\"Despite the grim mood, I smiled and cracked my knuckles. \"Ready to wrestle with my gorgeous boyfriend? Oh, I'd say I'm ready for that.\"Amusement softened his eyes. \"I'll try to control where I put my hands, but in the heat of things, who knows what could happen?\" I added. Patch grinned. \"Sounds promising.": "Becca",
  "I was terrified of what might have happened to you,\" I choked": "Becca",
  "I have a free couple of hours,\" I told him, walking toward my car, which was parked on the next block. \"There's a very private, very secluded barn in Lookout Hill Park behind the carousel. I could be there in fifteen minutes.\" I heard the smile in his voice. \"You want me bad.": "Becca",
  "My mom's coming home soon,\" I said. \"We should go to your place.\"Patch ran a hand across the shadow of stubble along his jaw. \"I have rules about who I take there.\" I was getting really tired of that answer. \"If you showed me, you'd have to kill me?\" I guessed, fighting the urge to feel irritated. \"Once I'm inside, I can never leave?\"Patch studied me a moment. Then he reached into his pocket, twisted a key off his key chain, and slipped it into the front pocket of my pajama top. \"Once you've gone inside, you have to keep coming back.": "Becca",
  "Patch tipped my chin up. \"If I could make this go away, I would. If I could stand in your place, I wouldn't hesitate. But I'm left with one choice, and that's to stand by your side through the end. I won't waver, Angel, I can promise you that.": "Becca",
  "And here I thought they were called Peeping Toms.\" I didn't need to see him to know he wore a smile. \"Stop laughing,\" I said, my cheeks hot with humiliation. \"Get me down.\"\"Jump.\"\"What?\"\"I'll catch you.\"\"Are you crazy? Go inside and open the window. Or get a ladder.\"\"I don't need a ladder. Jump. I'm not going to drop you.": "Becca",
  "She clenched her fist in his T-shirt, put her other arm around those too-broad, too-real shoulders. When he tried to pull away, she held on tight.

  "Patch leaned back against the booth and arched his eyebrows at me. The gesture said it all: Pay up.\"You got lucky,\" I ": "Becca",
  "I tilted my chin up a fraction. \"You can't f-force me to stay here.\" I'd only agreed to come this far because I didn't want to stand out in the downpour, for one, and I had high hopes of finding a phone, for two. \"That sounded more like a question than a statement,\" said Patch. \"Then ans-s-swer it.\"His rogue smile crept out. \"It's hard to concentrate on answers with you looking like that.\"I glanced down at Patch's black shirt, wet and clinging to my body. I brushed past him and shut the bathroom door between us.": "Becca",

  "I nearly had a cakegasm at the table. My eyes rolled back in my head, and I moaned. \"Sweet Christ.\" I opened my eyes to find Hunter watching me with the strangest expression on his face.\"What? It's really good; you should try some,\" I said, pushing the plate at him. It was a testament of how embarrassed I was about the cakegasm that I was even sharing at all.\"I swear, if there weren't a table between us, I would be kissing you right now. And none too gently.\"I put my form down and swallowed so I wouldn't choke. \"You didn't seem to mind about the recliner,\" I said. \"True.

Please, have some.\"\"If you're going to make that noise and that face again, I don't know if I can let you have any more.\"\"I'll be good. I swear.\"\"You're not good. That's the problem.\"\"You're right. I'm not,\" I said, giving him my own smirk. \"I do try, though.\"\"Cruel. That's the word to describe you right now.\"\"Just have some cake.": "Chelsea",
  "So what now?\" he said. \"What do you mean?\"\"What do we do now? We can't just be roommates.\"\"You said you didn't like me.\"\"I don't like you. I don't like how your hair smells, and how I can't stop thinking about waking up and seeing your face. I hate how my bed felt empty when you left. I don't like how good you were with my family, especially Harper, and how I wanted to see you with then again, but not just as a guest. As a member. You're right. I don't like you at all.\"\"When did you change your mind?\"\"My mind never changed. I've wanted you since the moment you opened the door and had that stunned look on your face. It just took me a while to admit it. Why deny it now? It is what it is and it's not going to change.\"\"Oh.\"\"This doesn't mean I'm going to be nice. I'm still going to be an ass. I'll just be an ass who apologizes and brings you flowers to say he's been a dick.\"\"Chocolate,\" I said. \"What?\"\"I'd rather have chocolate when you apologize.\"\"Chocolate it is.\" He smiled. \"So does that mean what I think it means?\"\"No. It just means that you get to bring me chocolate when you've been an ass. I'm going to weigh three hundred pounds.\" I focused my attention back on the peppers. I couldn't think about Hunter's declaration of... whatever it was. Footsteps didn't make me look up. \"Taylor, look at me. Please.\" Damn. If only he didn't say please. \"I can't promise to not make you mad. I can't promise that I won't hurt you. All I can promise is that I want you in my life, and I'll do anything to keep you there.": "Chelsea",
  "You're not just doing that to impress her, are you?\"\"Everything I do is to impress her. It's my mission in life,\" he said with a completely serious face, while he squeezed my knee under the table. Mom burst out laughing. \"I like him,\" she said.\"Me too.

You smile at me in bed every time you wander outta my bedroom in my shirts, my tees, or your work clothes and honest to Christ, it sets me up for the day. And no matter what shit goes down, I get through it knowin' whichever bed I climb into at night, you're in it ready to snuggle into me or give me what I wanna take. Your girl, a headache. You, never.

It was the strangest thing, being in the room alone without you. I couldn't hear you breathing, and your laughter was gone and you were gone, and it was like a part of my life was missing. A big part. I tripped going to the bathroom and banged my head. See?\" He pointed to a lovely gash on his forehead.\"And then I burned my hand on the toaster oven. And then my car wouldn't start.

My ongoing relationship with Jim Packer, FitzSimons Allison and many other brilliant Anglican evangelicals would not have happened without Jim Hampson.

  "Conversion was turning out to be quite far from the greeting-card moment promised by televangelists, when Jesus steps into your life, personally saves you, and becomes your lucky charm forever.

  "Of course, there were innumerable conversions during these years, as Christianity became the religion of Western Europe and Christendom took its characteristic shape. Many of these were undramatic \u2013 serfs responding to the importunity of their lords \u2013 or group events, as in the conversion of Clovis\u2019s troops. But for many others there was no longer need of conversion. The contours of Christian experience had shifted. Whereas up to the time of Augustine there had been four stages of initiation and incorporation into the church, there were no typically two. The first stage was brief and obligatory \u2013 baptism in the days or months after birth. The second stage would happen later and would take longer \u2013 if it took place at all \u2013 when confirmation happened and when parents instructed their children and godparents instructed their godchildren in the beliefs and behavior of the Christian church. Indeed, at this time of the rapid spread of Christianity into new territories, it was vitally necessary that the baptizands be taught well. The heroic and valorous values of the folk, the glorious narratives of warriors, the adulation of wealth and strength \u2013 all of these were as firmly in place in seventh-century Gaul as the pagan values and narratives had been in third-century Rome. If Christianity were to be a religion of revelation that could challenge the commonplaces of Gallic society, if new habits were to be taught and new role models were to be adopted, there would have to be some form of postbaptismal pastoral follow-up.": "Alan",
  "Christian holiness consists not of trying as hard as we can to be good but of learning to live in the new world created by Easter, the new world we publicly entered in our baptism. There are many parts of the world we can\u2019t do anything about except pray.

  "At every turn, while he was investigating the background for his study of Thomas Nashe, he would encounter the Church \u2014 what Chesterton called (another book title) The Thing. It was everywhere. At one point, he later told me (and he was never very specific just when that point occurred), he decided that the thing had to be sorted out or he couldn't rest. Either it ws true, or it wasn't. Either the entire matter was true, all of it, exactly as the Church claimed, or it was the biggest hoax ever perpetrated on a gullible mankind. With that choice clearly delineated, he set out to find which was the case. What came next was not more study, but testing.The matter had to be tested \u2014 on its own terms: that is, by prayer. He told me that the principal prayer that he used was not some long or complex formula, but simply, \"Lord, please, send me a sign.\" He reported that, almost immediately, not one but a deluge of signs arrived. And they continued to arrive unabated for a long time. As to just what the signs consisted in and what happened next, well, some things must remain private.

  "I never came into the church as a person who was being taught. I came in on my knees. That is the only way in. When people start praying they need truths; that\u2019s all. You don\u2019t come into the Church by ideas and concepts, and you cannot leave by mere disagreement. It has to be a loss of faith, a loss of participation. You can tell when people leave the Church: they have quit praying.Actively relating to the Church's prayer and sacraments is not done through ideas. Any Catholic today who has an intellectual disagreement with the Church has an illusion. You cannot have an intellectual disagreement with the Church: that's meaningless.

I don't know what you're thinking or what it's like inside you and you don't know what it's like inside me. In fiction I think we can leap over that wall itself in a certain way... There's another level... A really great piece of fiction for me may or may not take me away and make me forget that I'm sitting in a chair. There's real commercial stuff can do that, and a riveting plot can do that, but it doesn't make me feel less lonely... There's a kind of Ah-ha! Somebody at least for a moment feels about something or sees something the way that I do. It doesn't happen all the time. It's these brief flashes or flames, but I get that sometimes.

  "Why is it that women are the only ones who will write perfect men into fiction? It's strange. If a man portrayed his fictional men as archangels, the feminists would throw back their heads and howl, \"UNFAIR!\" but we women will create our own Mr. Darcy's and Mr. Knightley's and defy anyone who would point out their unrealistic points. The men aren't the ones crazy about Pride and Prejudice. Obviously they don't find perfect men realistic and honest enough to bother reading about. We don't write perfect women characters, do we? No. Our women all have bad tempers, or resentful hearts, or scabby pasts, or hidden fears--things that make them real. It's because we're easy on ourselves and aren't trying to boast perfection because we know we don't measure up. Then why do we hold men to a different standard?..... I'd caution all writers to make sure that your male \"hero\" in your story has his own flaws. You don't want a one-dimensional character. You don't want a perfect man that will drive away other men from reading the book.Look to the men in your life. The men around you. Look to your brothers and fathers and pastors and neighbors.

And we\u2019re now finally at a place where we\u2019re seeing some really positive representations of trans folks in pop culture, and there\u2019s this new pressure -- at least, I feel it, within trans and trans-ally communities -- to only focus on the positive. Because we\u2019re trying, in some sense, to overcompensate for the years and years of too much negativity. As a writer, you might feel a pressure to push the negative stuff away. But there are consequences for that too. Anyone who\u2019s working with trans characters right now is going to have to reconcile that tension.": "Mitch",
  "Too often we sit back and speak platitudes of the nitty-gritty bits of writing; the editing, the story structure, the verbal sparring vs. banter, the character development, the world-building become more important to us than the tune rhythm of the tale. And when you lose the music of the story, all the footwork in the world is not going to make up for the loss of continuity and heart. We need to take a step back in our souls and conjure the image of what this story is: the notes and beats and things woven into it's fullness. See, that's what is so easy to lose sight of as we write. We forget that, in a way, this story is a full story in itself. We tend to try to build the story piece by piece, line upon line, precept upon precept, but that--as any true writer knows--is not entirely practical. A story does have its own identity. To some extent, the story exists in your mind as a whole. Its own being. To chance sounding sappy: Your story is a full piece of music waiting for you to dance it into existence. Don't make the mistake of leaving out all the music. It is tempting to want to have everything arranged to perfection so that little editing will be done. But if you are keeping in mind the way your story needs to run--feeling it and dwelling in the beauty of its passion and color and vibe--the footwork will take care of itself. Certainly it will require practice and your technicalities will need a little work--everyone's does. But you will have captured the essence and blood of the tale, and really that's the prettiest part of a dance.": "Rachel",

I didn't pick up your book to read garbage. If this is as clever as you can be, I don't want to read your prose. In life if you met someone who spoke like this, you'd want to flee. Then why put this stuff on the page?As near as I can determine, this abomination occurs because a writer is corrupted by the awful -blanking- dialog that movies inflict on us these days. It's also a sign of insecurity. The writer wonders if the dialog is strong enough and decides a lot of -blanking-blank- will do the trick.Someone might object that this kind of dialog is realistic in certain situations--intense scenes involving policemen or soldiers for example. I can only reply that in my research I spend considerable time with policemen and soldiers. Few of them curse any more than a normal person would. This garbage isn't realistic.

And then you stroll through what Updike called the grottos of Ulysses, and after that you consort with Baldwin or Welty or Spencer, or Morrison, or Bellow or Fitzgerald and then back to W. Shakespeare, Esq; the champ, and all the time you feel the excitement of being in the presence of IT. And when you yourself spend the good time writing, you are not different in kind than any of these people, you are part of that miracle of human invention. So get to work.

Why do you write so many books, that no one of us may be deceived about the gods and believe that they take care of men; or that no one may suppose the nature of good to be other than pleasure?For if this is so, lie down and sleep, and lead the life of a worm, of which you judged yourself worthy: eat and drink, and enjoy women, and ease yourself, and snore.And what is it to you, how the rest shall think about these things, whether right or wrong?

  "... since I was still, and must for long remain, in that period of life when one has not yet separated the fact of this sensual pleasure from the various women in whose company one has tasted it, when one has not reduced it to a general idea which makes one regard them thenceforward as the variable instruments of a pleasure that is always the same.

  "You learn more about life and people in two hours of war than in four decades of peace. War is dirty, sure, war is senseless, but come on! Civilian life is also senseless, in its sameness and it's reasonableness and because it dulls the instincts. The truth that no one dares speak aloud is that war is a pleasure, The greatest pleasure there is, otherwise it would stop immediately. Once you've tasted it, it's like heroin: you want more. (...)

For then the die is cast, the person whose company we enjoy at that moment is the person we shall henceforward love. It is not even necessary for that person to have attracted us, up till then, more than or even as much as others. All that was needed was that our predilection should become exclusive. And that condition is fulfilled when \u2014 in this moment of deprivation \u2014 the quest for the pleasures we enjoyed in his or her company is suddenly replaced by an anxious, torturing need, whose object is the person alone, an absurd, irrational need which the laws of this world make it impossible to satisfy and difficult to assuage \u2014 the insensate, agonising need to possess exclusively.": "Marcel",

She teaches you the nature of happiness: what is the right amount, what is too much, and the kind that makes you want more of what is bad for you. A mother helps her baby flex her first feelings of pleasure. She teaches her when to later exercise restraint, or to take squealing joy in recognizing the fluttering leaves of the gingko tree, to sense a quieter but more profound satisfaction in chancing upon an everlasting pine. A mother enables you to realize that there are different levels of beauty and therein lie the sources of pleasure, some of which are popular and ordinary, and thus of brief value, and others of which are difficult and rare, and hence worth pursuing.": "Amy",

Again like fundamentalists today, they looked on the prospect of the violent destruction of mankind without turning a hair. The remarkable similarity between the first Tudor Puritans and the fanatics among today's Christian fundamentalists extends to their selective reading of the Bible, their emphasis on the Book of Revelation, their certainty of their rightness, even to their phraseology.

  "Nuclear weapons have only been used twice, both times in the war against Japan. In each case it was used by the United States during World War II. The first was used on August 6, 1945, over the Japanese city of Hiroshima and the second was dropped three days later over the Japanese city of Nagasaki. The two bombs resulted in the deaths of nearly a quarter million people! Recently I have heard it said that since we have the second largest arsenal of nuclear bombs, we should use them to teach North Korea a lesson and reduce tensions. Perhaps we are the ones that need to learn a lesson, so let me start by saying that since these first two bombs that have been used in anger, over two thousand tests have been conducted and that it was Russia that tested the largest bomb ever detonated. On 30 October 1961, Russia which was then the Soviet Union, detonated what was called the Tsar Bomb, a hydrogen bomb with a yield of 50 megatons which is more than 3,000 times as powerful as the bomb dropped on Hiroshima.Are we and our leaders insane? It is only the \u201cTreaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons\u201d of which we are a member that can reduce the spread and possible the use of nuclear weapons. Now with North Korea being a player, its effectiveness has been questioned and we are on the brink of engaging in a contest that threatens to kill 2,000,000 people in the first day. Many of these people are American military personnel and their families stationed in in Seoul, South Korea.

The scholars of other schools/sects evidently did not easily give up their arguments against the historicizing of a very ancient mythological creature. We have lost the exact arguments of these learned dissenters because Christians destroyed any traces of their works. Nonetheless, the Christians preserved the contentions of their detractors through their own refutations.For example, early Church Father Tertullian (c. 160-220 CE), an 'ex-Pagan' and a presbyter at Carthage, ironically admitted the true origins of the Christ story and other such myths by stating in refutation of his critics, 'You say we worship the sun; so do you.

  "The key to success in any area of life is to first know and master the area of focus. Cures to disease have been found, since time immemorial, by studying how the body functions as well as how the disease affects the sick. Seek depth in knowledge and research.": "Archibald",
  "A life that lacks physical exercise and activity leads to lethargy and promotes sickness of both body and mind. Exercise is important because it helps the heart, lungs, muscles and brain to be more efficient in their use of oxygen. Take personal responsibility over what you can control \u2013 it\u2019s your life.": "Archibald",
  "Eat right. It\u2019s not just about too much or too little food. Eating right means knowing the right selection of foods with the right nutrient content and in the right quantities, taken at the right frequencies to maintain a healthy body and mind.": "Archibald",
  "A hygienic environment, proper waste and sewer disposal, clean water and all efforts that destroy disease-carriers like flies and mosquitoes will reduce the spread of disease and promote good health. My home challenge for a hygienic environment is that we should be responsible enough to make sure we are safe and comfortable eating apples in the toilet and bathroom!": "Archibald",
  "One key habit I adopted is washing or sanitizing of hands every time, especially after using the toilet, before eating or handling food and whenever I go to visit someone in hospital and after leaving the hospital. Also use proper protective clothing in other circumstances like assisting ailing relatives and friends with communicable diseases.": "Archibald",
  "Whilst a level playing field cannot be guaranteed, one thing that is guaranteed is your fair share of challenges. It\u2019s not a matter of IF they come, but WHEN you will encounter them.": "Archibald",
  "Exercise must become a regular part of your day or personal effectiveness system. Do not wait to start exercising because you want to lose weight or because the doctor has given you some scary update on your health. Exercise to keep fit and stay healthy. It\u2019s not too late to start now.": "Archibald",
  "Numerous studies have proven that physical health and longevity are linked to eating a balanced diet, maintaining proper weight, exercising regularly, abstinence and proper sexual conduct, avoiding tobacco and alcohol, maintaining a clean and hygienic living and working environment, knowing and keeping track of your health status all the time. How do you rate yourself on all these?": "Archibald",
  "If you are a person of faith like me, then learn to discern between what requires medical intervention and what requires spiritual or even psychological specialists. There are enough physicians and specialists to deal with medical conditions, allow them to play their part without disturbing their interventions by adopting untested bush-advice.": "Archibald",
  "When catering for your spiritual needs make sure that you authenticate the capacity and qualification of the person or people you allow access to your spiritual being. Being careless in this regard is as dangerous as allowing an untrained person to treat you or operate on you to address a medical condition. While the bush-doctor kills your body, the false spiritual leader will destroy body, soul and spirit. Therefore use your belief\u2019s spiritual standard, not a merely mental or intellectual standard, to get spiritual help.": "Archibald",
  "For the Christian, the Bible, the Holy Spirit, guidance from trusted leaders and a revelation from your growing personal relationship with God go a long way to provide guidance. Learn to distinguish between spiritual blackmail and Godly Bible-based advice or warnings. Study your religion or belief and know it for yourself, heavy reliance on a third party for prolonged periods will sometimes open you up to possible abuse.": "Archibald",
  "Ask yourself - How do I see myself as a leader? How do I use my personal mission and vision to create leadership focus? What does my mission or vision mean in the context of leading others? How many people are going to succeed in their endeavours, through my leadership influence? Do I expect of myself, what I expect of those who follow me? Or I have my own separate standards for the same principles I expect others to live by?": "Archibald",
  "If you disconnect yourself from principles you believe must work for others, then you create a leadership brand that is not genuine and that will lead you to say one thing and practice another. This is the reason why knowledge and mastery issues covered at a personal level, must be revisited with a leadership focus.": "Archibald",
  "Your vision at a leadership level needs to be more global and selfless, it needs to go beyond you. Reflect and project your dream for a perfect world, even if you can only make it a great world.": "Archibald",
  "How do you visualize the success of those parts of the world falling under your leadership? What about the success of your organisation, your family and all the people related to the two institutions? How fulfilling are the results of this personal evaluation? What can you start doing about it, today?": "Archibald",
  "Why is the world in need of a leader like you? You must lead for significant impact. As a leader, find the \u201ccause\u201d driving your leadership brand and pursue its resolution with passion and excellence.": "Archibald",
  "There are silent killers like poverty, hunger, easily preventable diseases and illnesses, and other related conditions. These remain a daily and ongoing catastrophe, but they rarely manage to achieve and sustain, prime-time headline coverage on the news. Why not report on these until someone acts on them?": "Archibald",
  "If the UN and other international multilateral institutions are sending troops and weaponry, now they must begin to fund training and leadership development at the same levels. The new war must start with the quality of beliefs and dreams that are planted into the hearts and minds of school children at a personal level and permeate the driving philosophies of entire societies and communities.": "Archibald",
  "My personal convictions drive me to join those like-minded, in the recruitment of a growing army without guns, no hatred or prejudice, but with a leadership voice of influence and harnessing resources to create the change they desire. The major problems facing the world, particularly our beloved African continent, will not be won by sanctions, cruelty, ethnic cleansing, revenge, guns or bullets. The challenges are not largely externally motivated, so the platform to change them must shift. Shift from selfish to selfless, from external to internal, from behaviours to beliefs. Some of them are externally sponsored but self-inflicted, whilst most of them are due to greed, short-sightedness, abuse and selfishness.": "Archibald",
  "As you strive for personal effectiveness and leadership excellence, there are local and global questions that you will inevitably have to face. These range from poverty, corruption, terrorism, food security, scarcity of resources and overpopulation among others. Your power and influence for significance in leadership excellence will increase in direct proportion to your ability to find effective and sustainable practical solutions to some of these real-life challenges.": "Archibald",
  "Realistic and unrealistic expectations will be placed on you, demands will be made, fair and unfair judgment will be passed. Your growing leadership intelligence should reflect in your objective response or reaction to these challenges \u2013 remember more eyes than you can see are watching you. Know when it is prudent to make a comment, to set the record straight or just not comment. Decide which invitations to accept and which ones to send a representative or to turn down. Continuously reflecting on your mission, beliefs and values will make this process more objective.": "Archibald",
  "Because leaders and influential people are just as human as any other person, they sometimes forget that by doing little extra things to become extraordinary means they no longer have a completely private life. You must be willing to pay this price because if you don\u2019t, the consequences can be more disastrous. Learn to plan and be deliberate in also ensuring you and your family can still enjoy quality private moments.": "Archibald",
  "Now that you are a leader. Everyone will want to know what you are doing and feel at liberty to comment or scrutinize even your private life. The world will become interested in your family life, your health, your achievements but most interestingly your shortcomings.": "Archibald",
  "The call to leadership excellence means you must now be awake to the reality that you are no longer your own, you are a blessing to society. In business, this will also mean value given to shareholders, customers, employees as well as society. This will take you, your family and your corporate base to appreciate that your leadership role and influence demands that they share you with other causes and stakeholders. As an effective person, you must be able to balance the demands on you and create the additional time that leadership at a higher level requires.": "Archibald",
  "Whilst personal effectiveness focuses more on your personal development goals as you become the best practitioner in your area of specialty": "leadership",
  "The primary challenge for any aspiring public office bearer is to have a well-defined cause and diligently represent that cause until a significant impact is witnessed. Adhering to value-based leadership principles must be at the top of the priority list for public office aspirants.": "Archibald",
  "The role of political leadership in any society will remain critical to the socio-economic progression of the world. It is however worrying to see the growing number of people, including the youth, getting into politics for economic gain and not for a cause. This, inter alia, is the contaminated seed and eventual root of chronic corruption because such leadership will always be selfishly seeking gain and enrichment from their roles and offices.": "Archibald",
  "The leadership challenge for celebrities and those in the limelight includes turning focus from being self-centred to influencing vulnerable and gullible youngsters, especially teenagers, in a positive way; realising that it is possible to entertain and increase following without promoting societal vices like drug & alcohol abuse, irresponsible sexual behaviour, prejudice of all kinds, criminal heroism, gangsterism and all forms of violence.": "Archibald",
  "Most entertainers and celebrities realize the influencing power they possess. The sad reality is that those in the know tend to utilise that power with a lack of mission, beliefs and values which could translate to a positive impact of their talent on the lives as well as missions of those who form their fan-base. Their agenda tends to be self-centred but it can change.": "Archibald",
  "The life of a leader becomes intertwined with the expectations of those influenced as well as society in general. The expectations are so high, sometimes seemingly unreasonable, but all the same a reality that can only be brushed aside to the detriment of the one who does so. The majority of the eyes scrutinizing your life as a leader are not close or obvious \u2013 but they exist everywhere. Waiting for you to slip up or make a mistake so they can point, shout, criticize or destroy. Such is the immeasurable influence of leadership and what it attracts to itself.": "Archibald",
  "Ask yourself - Can you manage projects and meetings effectively? Do you have requisite knowledge of the business financial numbers? Can you manage conflict and change within dynamic environments? Do you have what it takes to respond to the demands of a global village? How deep is your leadership substance?": "Archibald",
  "Do you have an entrepreneurial spirit in you? How helpful and creative are you in solving challenges? Have you attained communication and negotiation excellence status? Can you effectively market yourself and your service/product? How effective are you at selling your vision? The answers will determine how far your influence will go.": "Archibald",
  "Benchmark against the top performing movers and shakers in your game. What are the skills required to achieve excellence in your area of specialty as a leader? How are you managing your vision and mission? Do you demonstrate a life lived with clear goals and targets? How are you providing direction, influence and developing others to lead? What is the evidence of the good leadership of your team?": "Archibald",
  "The key to leadership remains influence. What kind of a leader are you and how do you deliberately model your leadership to achieve desired impact on those you influence or you seek to influence?": "Archibald",
  "Principle-centred leadership, consistent leadership, stewardship and servant leadership are all values-driven. Always go back to reflect on your beliefs and values as you go about your leadership responsibilities.": "Archibald",
  "When you become aware of the need to practice servant leadership, to act as a faithful steward and exercise good personal governance \u2013 the challenge is to align these three and ensure they fit in with your defined leadership vision, mission and values. If there is no congruence, then leadership effectiveness will be compromised because the likelihood of not practicing these sound principles will be very high.": "Archibald",
  "Leadership is a privilege to serve and make a difference. Take care of what belongs to another as if it were your own. Be accountable to others or to another because you realize you are not a master. Be considerate of those you serve because they, not you, perceive the difference you are or you are not making, in their lives.": "Archibald",
  "The principles of stewardship and servant leadership challenge you to look at leadership differently. Consider these values.": "Archibald",
  "Leadership excellence means that you must be accepted as a leader, not forcing yourself upon those you lead. Outside of formal authority, it takes trust for people to accept your leadership. Proven consistent leadership choices and results will earn you invaluable points of trust.": "Archibald",
  "Consistency in leadership means everyone knows what to expect from you or in dealing with you. It is the quality that draws respect and value towards a leadership brand. This also means you have the discipline to stick to your principles and values regardless of challenges or consequences, and you prove this over a long period of time.": "Archibald",
  "Your leadership principles give that unique character to your leadership brand. When all your responses, decisions, choices and leadership practices are filtered through your well defined principles, you have automatically connected yourself to making the success of your leadership excellence brand more deliberate.": "Archibald",
  "Two key leadership excellence values worth focusing on separately are being principle-centred and being consistent. The complimentary construction of these leadership fibres can easily be misconstrued for unreasonable stubbornness, yet they form the backbone of strong, effective transformational leadership. In building the legacy advocated for, in leadership excellence brands, you must sharpen the practice of these leadership values in every area of your life.": "Archibald",
  "At a leadership level, there is need to become aware of the realities required to lead and deliver value to people and groups, some who might have values and beliefs that significantly differ from your own. The ability to objectively strike this balance will indicate your level of leadership maturity.": "Archibald",
  "When you have defined your mission, values and attitudes in the context of leadership influence and excellence, you also need to conduct a personal audit, checking how aligned they are to your current leadership practices. Where necessary, begin to make adjustments.": "Archibald",
  "The principles that guide your decisions as a leader must not be contradictory to your personal values. Your personal values must lay the strong foundation on which you build your leadership tenets. In becoming a principle-centred leader, these leadership values become your guiding principles and lenses for decision making.": "Archibald",
  "There is need for clarity on what your leadership role stands for and the kind of unwavering and unstoppable beliefs required. These beliefs must not be deterred by current circumstances and conditions. They must become your source of internal strength and inspiration, especially during trying times. How strong, positive and empowering is your belief system as a leader?": "Archibald",
  "Development of states, urbanization, mechanization and industrialisation have all brought phenomenal strides to growth and prosperity of economies and their populace. They have also brought with them the insatiable need for energy resources with the related offspring of instability, conflict, war and corruption.": "Archibald",
  "Your leadership skill-set might be what we have been waiting for, to bring order and finality to major challenges that affect the global village. The vast hydroelectric generation capacity in Africa, particularly the Great Lakes region and along the Nile River, still remains unutilized potential not benefiting the people of Africa most of whom continue to live in darkness and depleting the forests looking for wood fuel and more fertile farming land.": "Archibald",
  "Due to poaching and global warming, future generations will not be able to see some animal and plant species given the rate at which they are disappearing from the forests and seas. Both vices are man-made and man must be challenged and confronted on these global issues. Park rangers, armies and nature conservation trusts are still grappling to find lasting solutions \u2013 will you join them in this fight?": "Archibald",
  "Due to climate change and growing world population, the demand for vital requirements for human survival will continue to rise. If the world is not producing as much food as demanded, the prices will continue to rise affecting the poor and lower classes more, in every society. It is sad, looking at the shocking statistics of people who die every day as well as the spread of preventable diseases in developing nations, just because people do not have access to clean drinking water. So are we proud of our leadership contribution? Are we doing enough to increase food production, harvest rain water and replenish underground water reserves?": "Archibald",
  "There still remains a lot of space to share on earth, and overpopulation remains a perception. We put geographic and political boundaries around ourselves because of the need to rule and control. To find solutions, the current and future leader needs to go back to redefine underlying influences to relevant political, demographic and geographic systems. Will you take up the challenge and consider the possibilities?": "Archibald",
  "I am aware that for decades there has been exploration of options and concrete plans and investments being made to look at life on another planet. We must not stop exploring. At the same time let\u2019s preserve and enhance the life we already have on earth. Join the green revolution, plant trees, stop soil erosion, reduce carbon emissions into the atmosphere and promote recycling of waste. Become aware, create awareness, act responsibly and lead by example.": "Archibald",
  "Research has shown the challenge caused by Climate change is mainly man-made due to abdication of leadership and personal responsibility in taking care of the environment. Will you be part of the army replenishing the earth and promoting proper stewardship of its resources?": "Archibald",
  "The need for security and power riding on energies that should be making life better and easier for the masses remains a great error in leadership focus. Why should the discovery of uranium\u2019s potential become a curse instead of a blessing? I am sure any type of power (nuclear and leadership included) in the wrong hands has the unfortunate potential to become a curse. A lot more is involved, including greed that causes the wealthy to sponsor violence and chaos. All, in order to profit from conflict, yet disregarding the harm caused to the vulnerable majority.": "Archibald",
  "Short term interventions will call for more guns and force in affected areas, in order to protect the vulnerable and suppress proliferation of terrorism and sectarian hatred, but the forward-looking leadership driving for sustainable solutions must now promote deliberate intents to influence systems of education, belief, culture, values and attitudes to promote tolerance, mutual respect, love and hope for all to succeed. If this area was given the same kind of attention and resources that HIV-AIDS has received to date, I can promise you, the same progress made in the containment of HIV-AIDS, would also have been made on the extremism front.": "Archibald",
  "Indeed, there are demons that must be cast out by exposure and education, for it is the ignorant and the uninformed who fall prey to the evil trickery and abuse of those who sponsor violence, hatred and every form of extremism. At some point, man\u2019s Maker cries out, \u201cMy people perish because of a lack of knowledge.": "Archibald",
  "Global summits are necessary to discuss and strategise, but will never be the platform that will uproot the seeds of hatred, intolerance, polluted beliefs and passionate convictions that fuel whatever we term terrorism. The excelling leader should be thinking of dealing with the soil and the seed, how do you make sure the soil is not polluted and how do you counter the retrogressive seed that is being planted?": "Archibald",
  "Terrorist groups will not, in most instances, openly recruit from universities or the well developed areas that politicians and business leaders are always focusing on. They will not flight newspaper or TV adverts, but will use belief systems riding on the back of disadvantages, poverty and problems that have remained unaddressed in particular communities, tribal and religious ideologies. They will recruit the most vulnerable to harm and attack the most vulnerable, in order to spite leaders and authorities.": "Archibald",
  "If challenges within this Global Economic sphere are not addressed, we risk having the same populace that celebrated the collapse of communism, or their future generations, rising up to demand that we go back to communistic approaches to the economy. Rising national debt of global powers, the growing gap between the rich and poor and the ripple effects of related threats, remain a challenge for the global economy.

I\u2019m sure the Clave will beecstatic.\u201d\u201cThey\u2019ll just say you\u2019re mad,\u201d said Jessamine. \u201cThey already think it, so what\u2019s the difference, really?": "Cassandra",
  "Her eyes met his, but she looked quickly away; entangling gazes with Will was confusing at best, dizzying at worst.": "Cassandra",
  "Demon pox. There's always demon pox.": "Cassandra",
  "She hated that will had this effect on her. Hated it. She knew better. She knew what he thought of her. That she was worth nothing. And still a look from him could make her tremble with mingled hatred and longing. It was like poison in her blood, to which Jem was the only antidote.": "Cassandra",
  "Now for God's sake, will you two start behaving like a princess and a Courier?\" Halt told them. \"If you don't, I'll have to think about sending Will home.''Me?' Will said, his voice breaking into a high-pitched squeak of indignation. 'What's it got to do with me?''It's all your fault!' Halt shouted irrationally.": "John",
  "I hate... I hate when you die. It destroys me. I know i have no right to be so upset, because I'm not the one losing my life, but it breaks me apart inside. I'm not very good with words, and i dont know how to explain to you how i feel. I get lonely when you aren't with me. I miss you. And every time you die, a little piece of me dies with you.": "Courtney",
  "Tell me you\u2019ve seen the world.Now, you\u2019ve come back homeTell me you\u2019ve carried me with you,That you\u2019ve held me close.Tell me you\u2019ve missed meOr that I\u2019m not crazy for waiting causeOf all the butterflies that chose to stay,I\u2019m in love with the one that got away": "Laura",
  "I believe everything you say,\" Tessa said with a smile, her hands creeping down from his waist to his weapons belt. Her fingers closed on the hilt of a dagger, and she yanked it from the belt, smiling as he looked down at her in surprise. She kissed his cheek and stepped back. \"After all,\" she said, \"you weren't lying about that tattoo of the dragon of Wales, were you?": "Cassandra",
  "What is this Chocho business?' Will muttered to himself. But his friends overheard the comment.'It's a term of great respect,' they chorused, and he glared at them.'Oh, shut up,' he said.": "John",
  "More than every once in awhile,More than most dreams,More than just my heart,More than anything,More than you know,And more than I can say,I\u2019ve loved you moreEvery passing day": "Laura",
  "For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.": "Aleister",
  "Fitch is on his way. He's coming after he blows up some wizards.": "Cinda",
  "What the devil is Chocho?' Will whispered.Horace's grin broadened. 'You are. It's what the men call you,' he said. Then he added, 'It's a term of great respect.'Behind them, Halt nodded confirmation. 'Great respect,' he agreed.": "John",
  "I wont let him have you.": "Sophie",
  "How do we get there? How did you get here, by the way?' [Will asked].He heard Halt's deep sigh and knew he'd done it again.'Do you ever,' the older Ranger said with great deliberation, 'manage to ask just one question at a time? Or does it always have to be multiple choice with you?'Will looked at him in surprise. 'Do I do that?' he asked. 'Are you sure?'Halt said nothing. He raised his hands in a 'See what I mean?' gesture...'Halt,' [Selethen said], 'I could be wrong, but I think you were just guilty of the same fault. I'm sure I heard you ask two questions just then.''Thank you for pointing that out, Lord Selethen,' Halt said with icy formality.": "John",
  "\u200eHalt looked up at the trees above him.\"Why does this boy ask so many questions?\" he asked the trees.Naturally, they didn't answer.": "John",
  "[Will]'d barely been asleep a few minutes when Halt's voice woke him.'Will? Are you asleep?'...'I was,' he said, a little indignantly. 'I'm not now.''Good,' Halt replied, a trifle smugly. 'Serves you right.": "John",
  "Without thinking, [Will] spoke.'Halt? Are you awake?''No.' The ill humor in the one-word reply was unmistakable.'Oh. Sorry.''Shut up.'He pondered whether to apologize again and decided this would go against the instruction to shut up, so remained silent.": "John",
  "Gundar, seeing Halt upright for the first time in two days, stumped up the deck to join them.'Back on your feet then?' he boomed cheerfully, with typical Skandian tact. 'By Gorlag's toenails, with all the heaving abd puking you've been doing, I thought you'd turn yourself inside out and puke yourself over the rail!'...'You do paint a pretty picture, Gundar,' Will said...'Thank you for your concern,' Halt said icily...'So, did you find Albert?' Gundar went on, unabashed. Even Halt was puzzled by this sudden apparent change of subject.'Albert?' he asked. Too late, he saw Gundar's grin widening and knew he'd stepped into a trap.'You seemed to be looking for him. You'd lean over the rail and call, 'Al-b-e-e-e-e-e-r-t!' I thought he might be some Araluen sea god.''No, I didn't find him. Maybe I could look for him in your helmet.'He reached out a hand. But Gundar had heard what happened when Skandians lent their helmets to the grim-faced Ranger while onboard ship...'No, I'm pretty sure he's not there,' he said hurriedly.": "John",
  "Easy climb, Kurokuma. You do it easily.''Not on your life,' Horace said... 'That's what we have Rangers for. They climb up sheer rock walls and crawl along narrow, slippery ledges. I'm a trained warrior, and I'm far to valuable to risk such shenanigans.''We're not valuable?' Will said, feigning insult.Horace looked at him. 'We've got two of you. We can always afford to lose one,' he said firmly.": "John",
  "Whither thou goest, I will go;Where thou diest, will I dieAnd there will I be buried:The Angel do so to me, and more also,If aught but death part thee and me.": "Cassandra",
  "Will saw the first Senshi officer release and instantly knew where the arrow was aimed. 'They've spotted Shigeru!' He was about to turn and shove Shigeru to the ground, but as he did so, his eye caught a flicker of movement and he spun back.When asked later about what he did next, he could never explain how he managed it. Nor could he ever repeat the feat. He acted totally from instinct, an unbelievable piece of coordination between hand and eye.The Senshi arrow flashed downward, heading directly for Shigeru. Will flicked his bow at it, caught it and deflected it from its course. The arrowhead screeched on the hard, rocky ground and the arrow skittered away. Even Halt took a second to be impressed.'My god!' he said. 'How did you do that?": "John",
  "Dear God,\u201d said Will, looking from Charlotte to Nate and back again. \u201cIs there anything that makes women sillier than the sight of a wounded young man?\u201dTessa slitted her eyes at him. \u201cYou might want to clean the rest of the blood of your face before you continue arguing in that vein.\u201dWill threw his arms up in the air and stalked off. Charlotte looked at Tessa, a half smile curving the side of her mouth. \u201cI must say, I rather like the way you manage Will.\u201dTessa shook her head. \u201cNo one manages Will.": "Cassandra",
  "Will had been taken aback in his confrontation with Arisaka to discover that his name- Chocho- meant \"Butterfly\"... He was puzzled to know why they had selected it. His friends, of course, delighted in helping him guess the reason.'I assume it's because you're such a snazzy dresser,' Evanlyn said. 'You Rangers are a riot of color, after all.'...'I think it might be more to do with the way he raced around the training ground, darting here and there to correct the way a man might be holding his shield, then dashing off to show someone how to put their body weight into their javelin cast,' said Horace, a little more sympathetically. Then he ruined the effect by adding thoughtlessly, 'I must say, your cloak did flutter around like a butterfly's wings.": "John",
  "You cut me,\u201d he said. His voice was pleasant. British. Very ordinary. He looked at his hand with critical interest. \u201cIt might be fatal.\u201dTessa looked at him with wide eyes. \u201cAre you the Magister?\u201dHe tilted his hand to the side. Blood ran down it, spattering the floor. \u201cDear me, massive blood loss. Death could be imminent.\u201d\u201cAre you the Magister?\u201d\u201cMagister?\u201d He looked mildly surprised by her vehemence. \u201cThat means \u2018master\u2019 in Latin, doesn\u2019t it?\u201d\u201cI\u2026\u201d Tessa was feeling increasingly as if she were trapped in a strange dream. \u201cI suppose it does.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ve mastered many things in life. Navigating the streets of London, dancing the quadrille, the Japanese art of flower arranging, lying at charades, concealing a highly intoxicated state, delighting young women with my charms\u2026\u201dTessa stared.\u201cAlas,\u201d he went on, \u201cno one has ever actually referred to me as \u2018the master\u2019, or \u2018the magister\u2019, either. More\u2019s the pity\u2026": "Cassandra",
  "Who are you, gaijin? What do you know about honor?''I'm called Chocho,' Will said...'Chocho?' Arisaka shouted, goaded beyond control. 'Butterfly? Then die, Butterfly!": "John",
  "Halt eyed them balefully. They were all being so obvious about not mentioning his sudden reappearance that it was even worse than if they had commented on it...'Oh, go on!' he said. 'Somebody say something! I know what you're thinking!''It's good to see you up and about, Halt,' Selethen said gravely...Halt glared at the others and they quickly chorused their pleasure at seeing him back to his normal self. But he could see the grins they didn't quite manage to hide. He fixed a glare on Alyss.'I'm surprised at you Alyss,' he said. 'I expected no better of Will and Evanlyn, of course. Heartless beasts, the pair of them. But you! I thought you had been better trained!'...'Halt, I'm sorry! It's not funny, you're right... Shut up, Will.' This last was directed at Will as he tried, unsuccessfully, to smother a snigger.": "John",
  "Fighting positions, please, ladies...''That's debatable,' Halt said in an undertone to Will as they stood watching...'The 'fighting' part or the 'ladies' part?' Will replied with a grin.Halt looked at him and shook his head. 'Definitely the 'ladies,'' he said. 'There's no debate about the 'fighting.''Will shrugged. He knew there was an edginess to the girls' relationship and that it had something to do with him. Why that should be so was beyond him.": "John",
  "The two girls disappeared into the stern cabin once more. Will watched them go, then asked Halt, 'Anything you'd like me to do? Grow a beard? Learn to walk like a rooster?''If you could stop asking facetious questions, that'd be a start,' Halt told him. 'But it's probably a little late in life for you to do that.": "John",
  "Am I blind?\" Will's voice floated out of the darkness, tinged with annoyance. \"I'm not going to be at all pleased if you've blinded me, Henry.": "Cassandra",
  "She's alive,\" Thomas said, not opening his eyes.\"What?\" Will was caught off guard.\"The one you come back for. Her. Tessa. She's with Sophie.": "Cassandra",
  "She wept with shame for her lack of will and with fear for a love she couldn't control.": "Judith",
  "As for the temperature of Hell, Miss Gray,\u201d he said, \u201clet me give you a piece of advice. The handsome young fellow who\u2019s trying to rescue you from a hideous fate is never wrong. Not even if he says the sky is purple and made of hedgehogs.\u201dHe really is mad, Tessa thought, but didn\u2019t say so; she was too alarmed by the fact that he had started toward the wide double doors of the Dark Sisters\u2019 chambers.\u201cNo!\u201d She caught at his arm, pulling him back. \u201cNot that way. There\u2019s no way out. It\u2019s a dead end.\u201d\u201cCorrecting me again, I see.\u201d Will turned and strode the other way, toward the shadowy corridor Tessa had always feared. Swallowing hard, she followed him.": "Cassandra",
  "It was Will who broke the silence. \"Very well. You have me alone in the corrider-\"\"Yes, yes,\" said Tessa impatiently,\"and thousands of women all over England would pay handsomely for the privilege of such an opportunity. Can we put aside the display of your wit for a moment? This is important.": "Cassandra",
  "Everyone can use a little beauty.": "Alex",
  "Now, you and I both know that I\u2019ll wait a lifetime for you \u2013 remember, Butterfly Weeds never give up \u2013 so take your time down there. And tonight, as you watch that big, orange sun disappear into the earth and your world gradually grow dark, I\u2019ll help God turn on the stars, and I\u2019ll wait for my dawn \u2013 when you return to me, Julia Stephens.I love you, My Butterfly. You\u2019ll always be my endless song.Love always and forever,Your one and only Butterfly Weed, Will": "Laura",
  "He banged on the side of the carriage. \"Thomas! We must away at once to the nearest brothel. I seek scandal and low companionship.": "Cassandra",
  "You're right, Halt,' she said, and he nodded acklowledgement of her backing down.'Nice to hear someone else saying that for a change,' Will said cheerfully. 'Seems like I've said those words an awful lot in my time.'Halt turned a bleak gaze on him. 'And you've always been right.": "John",
  "If I kiss you now, I won\u2019t be able to stop. We\u2019ll miss the party.": "Courtney",
  "Don\u2019t be mad\u201d was the first thing he said. He really was terrified, as if the most frightening reaper on the planet was no scarier than a mouse, and yet put him in a tux and it was the Apocalypse.": "Courtney",
  "You point your feet out too much when you walk,\u201d Will went on. He was busy polishing an apple on his shirtfront, and appeared not to notice Tessa glaring at him. \u201cCamille walks delicately. Like a faun in the woods. Not like a duck\u201d\u201cI do not walk like a duck.\u201d\u201cI like ducks,\u201d Jem observed diplomatically. \u201cEspecially the ones in Hyde Park.": "Cassandra",
  "Charlotte, Will\u2019s beingvexing.''And the sun has come up in the east,'said Jem, to no one in particular.": "Cassandra",
  "All we could get out of them was that they were taking us to 'Kurokuma'. We didn't know if that was a place or a person. What does it mean, by the way?''I'm told it's a term of great respect,' Horace said, unwilling to admit that he didn't know.": "John",
  "Shokaku is a crane of some kind.''For lifting things?' Will asked.'For flying. A crane is a large bird,' she corrected him...'Seems like a logical thing for a crane to do,' Halt mused. 'I suppose you wouldn't expect it to mean 'a hiking crane' or 'a waddling crane.": "John",
  "Sudden conviction races through me, almost terrifying in its total certainty. I can't give him up. He's the other part of me. He gets what it feels like to be separate from everything and everyone, to reject the path others lay out for you. We're the same. Two sides to the same coin.": "Sophie",
  "It's unclear who moves first. We're in each other's arms, lips locked, melded, hotly fused. Our hands drag over each other, reacquainting, remembering, almost as if we're both verifying the other one is real flesh and blood.": "Sophie",
  "Lizzy, Will thought. Lizzy P. 'You n me gonna be buddies, darlin'. He stretched one hand to Elly's hair, and circled Donald Wade's rump with his free arm and touched Thomas's leg, on the far side of Elly. And he smiled at Lizzy P. and thought, Heaven's got nothin' on being the husband of Eleanor Dinsmore.": "LaVyrle",
  "What about you three, where are you going?\"Even before Halt answered, Will knew what he was going to say. But that didn't make it any less terrifying or blood-chilling when the words were said.\"We're going after the Kalkara.": "John",
  "Why, even Death stands still and waits an hour for such a will.": "Ella",
  "it's colder than a witch's tit in a steel bra": "David",
  "And therefor,\" said Magnus \"We must go.\" Will blinked at him. \"Go where?\"\"Don't worry about that right now, my love.\"Will blinked again. \"Pardon?": "Cassandra",
  "She had taken him for granted, she thought with surprise and shame, watching the flickering candlelight. She had assumed his kindness was so natural and so innate, she had never asked herself whether it cost him any effort. Any effort to stand between Will and the world, protecting each of them from the other. Any effort to accept the loss of his family with equanimity. Any effort to remain cheerful and calm in the face of his own dying.": "Cassandra",
  "But...' Horace looked from one familiar face to another. 'How did you come to..?'Before he could finish the question, Will interupted, thinking to clarify matters but only making them more puzzling...'We were all in Toscana for the treaty signing,' he began, then corrected himself. 'Well, Evanlyn wasn't. She came later. But, when she did, she told us you were missing, so we all boarded Gundar's ship-you should see it. It's a new design that can sail into the wind. But anyway, that's not important. And just before we left, Selethen decided to join us-what with you being an old comrade in arms and all-and...'He got no further. Halt, seeing the confusion growing on Horace's face, held up a hand to stop his babbling former apprentice...Will stopped, a little embarrassed as he realized that he had been running off at the mouth.": "John",
  "For if the will has nothing to employ it and love has no present object with which to busy itself, the soul finds itself without either support or occupation, its solitude and aridity cause it great distress and its thoughts involve it in the severest conflict.": "Teresa",
  "Then forget Gabriel. Is there a particular reason you keep biting vampires?\u201dWill touched the dried blood on his wrists and smiled. \u201cThey don\u2019t expect it.\u201d\u201cOf course they don\u2019t. They know what happens when one of us consumes vampire blood. They probably expect you to have more sense.\u201d\u201cThat expectation never seems to serve them very well, does it?\u201d\u201cIt hardly serves you, either.": "Cassandra",
  "Will interrupted. \"Henry,\" he said, \"you're on fire. You do know that, don't you?": "Cassandra",
  "When I shoot, the ball bounces hard against the backboard, and flies wildly through the air, knocking the coach in the head. I slap a hand over my mouth. The coach barely catches herself from falling. Several students laugh. She glares at me and readjusts her cap. With a small wave of apology, I head back to the end of the line. Will's there fighting laughter. \"Nice,\" he says. \"Glad I'm downcourt of you.\" I cross my arms and resist smiling, resist letting myself feel good around him. But he makes it hard. I want to smile. I want to like him, to be around him, to know him. \"Happy to amuse you.": "Sophie",
  "she could have dropped you both off. whar's the worst she can do? cry hysterically?\"the gears on the ute get stuck at the lights and will pushes tom's hand out of the way and and shoves it into the correct gear.\"it wasn't her\" he mutters after a moment.\"sorry?\" tom says.\"she didn't cry\"\"then what?\"it's too quiet except for the quiet for the crap engine sounding like a lawn mower.\"i cried\"luca bursts out laughing beside will.\"yeah, well i did\" will says. \"And it's not the thing you want to do in front of a bunch on engineers.": "Melina",
  "Stupid to speak of blame when the wills of the immortals are involved.": "Jacqueline",
  "At least I graduated,\" he muttered, stabbing the key in and unlocking the door. I sucked in a breath. \"I think dying was a little out of my control, thank you very much.\"\"If you say so\". He shrugged, but I saw the corner of his mouth turn up into a faint smile.": "Stacey",
  "Strong-willed heart, always makes me feel so touched. It reminds me about some 'fall and rise again' in my life.": "Toba",
  "Dresden\u2019s not gone,\u201d I said. I touched a hand lightly to my brow. \u201cHe\u2019s here.\u201d I touched Will\u2019s bare chest, on the left side. \u201cHere. Without him, without what he\u2019s done over the years, you and I would never have been able to pull this off.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d he agreed. \u201cProbably not. Definitely not.\u201d\u201cThere are a lot of people he\u2019s taught. Trained. Defended. And he\u2019s been an example. No single one of us can ever be what he was. But together, maybe we can.": "Jim",
  "Where there is a will, there is a way.": "Ernst",
  "Those guards are going to be all sorts of pissed when they find out they've been following a bunny rabbit.": "H.M.",
  "It seems rather prophetic. We were just joking about this the other day.\"\"I know. Fate has annoying timing.": "Kate",
  "Thou hast no right but to do thy will... For pure will, unassuaged of purpose, delivered from the lust of result, is every way perfect.": "Aleister",
  "love is the only fire that is hot enough to melt the iron obstinacy of a creatures will": "Alexander",
  "The moonlight streaming through the sheer draperies revealed Taylor smiling, boneless and peaceful in Will's embrace. The most dangerous man Will knew rested sweetly in his arms, trusting him with his love as he trusted Will to guard his life. It was beyond precious. Life, love, was made up of fragile moments like these. Fragile as Paris moonlight.": "Josh",
  "The night was fading. It was too early to be called dawn yet, but Taylor could just make out the outline of Will's weary, unshaven face. His deep blue eyes were the only color in the gray world of rain and shadows.Will leaned in, and his mouth covered Taylor's, rough but sweet, his tongue seeking Taylor's. Taylor opened willingly to that kiss, forgetting for a second his scratched, scraped hands and the rain running down the back of his neck. They kissed a lot these days, especially for men who had never been much for kissing. Taylor had become expert in all Will's kisses, from the hungry, lustful kisses that always made his own cock rise so fast it hurt, to the tender, almost cherishing kisses that Will generally saved for when he thought Taylor was sleeping. That dawn kiss beneath the pine trees rippled through him like an electric shock, a reminder that, tired, wet, and lost as they might be, so long as they were together, they were all right.": "Josh",
  "Her jaw dropped. She grabbed him by the shoulders. \u201cI think I have formed an attachment to you. You know, what the English call a desire to have symphonic concerts with someone at all hours of the day?\u201dHe smiled. \u201cAnd I love you too, darling.\u201d-Lizzy and Will": "Sherry",
  "Do you miss Wales?\u201d Tessa inquired.Will shrugged lightly. \u201cWhat\u2019s to miss? Sheep and singing,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the ridiculous language. Fe hoffwn i fod mor feddw, fyddai ddim yn cofio fy enw.\u201d\u201cWhat does that mean?\u201d\u201cIt means \u2018I wish to get so drunk I no longer remember my own name,\u2019 Quite useful.": "Cassandra",
  "We can't impose our will on a system. We can listen to what the system tells us, and discover how its properties and our values can work together to bring forth something much better than could ever be produced by our will alone.": "Donella",
  "You think I'm with you out of guilt?\"\"No, you ass. Of course not. I just mean\u2014\"\"You're a nut, MacAllister. I'm with you because I love you.\"There it was, out. Three little words. Three of the most common words in the world, but string them together and they were more powerful than any warrant, any extradition papers, or even treaty. Stronger than any magical spell. Had he really never said them aloud to Taylor?": "Josh",
  "I bear within me the seed, the rudiments, the possibility of life's capacities and endeavors. Where might I be, if I were not here? Who, what, how could I be, if I were not me, if this outward appearance that is me did not encase me, separating my consciousness from that of others who are not me? An organism\u2014a blind, rash, pitiful eruption of the insistent assertion of the will. Far better, really, if that will were to drift free in a night without time or space, than to languish in a prison cell lit only by the flickering, uncertain flame of the intellect.": "Thomas",
  "From *the form of time and of the single dimension* of the series of representations, on account of which the intellect, in order to take up one thing, must drop everything else, there follows not only the intellect\u2019s distraction, but also its *forgetfulness*. Most of what it has dropped it never takes up again, especially as the taking up again is bound to the principle of sufficient reason, and thus requires an occasion which the association of ideas and motivation have first to provide. Yet this occasion may be the remoter and the smaller, the more our susceptibility to it is enhanced by interest in the subject. But, as I have already shown in the essay *On the Principle of Sufficient Reason*, memory is not a receptacle, but a mere faculty, acquired by practice, of bringing forth any representations at random, so that these have always to be kept in practice by repetition, otherwise they are gradually lost. Accordingly, the knowledge even of the scholarly head exists only *virtualiter* as an acquired practice in producing certain representations. *Actualiter*, on the other hand, it is restricted to one particular representation, and for the moment is conscious of this one alone. Hence there results a strange contrast between what a man knows *potentia* and what he knows *actu*, in other words, between his knowledge and his thinking at any moment. The former is an immense and always somewhat chaotic mass, the latter a single, distinct thought. The relation is like that between the innumerable stars of the heavens and the telescope\u2019s narrow field of vision; it stands out remarkably when, on some occasion, a man wishes to bring to distinct recollection some isolated fact from his knowledge, and time and trouble are required to look for it and pick it out of that chaos. Rapidity in doing this is a special gift, but depends very much on the day and the hour; therefore sometimes memory refuses its service, even in things which, at another time, it has ready at hand. This consideration requires us in our studies to strive after the attainment of correct insight rather than an increase of learning, and to take to heart the fact that the *quality* of knowledge is more important than its quantity. Quantity gives books only thickness; quality imparts thoroughness as well as style; for it is an *intensive* dimension, whereas the other is merely extensive. It consists in the distinctness and completeness of the concepts, together with the purity and accuracy of the knowledge of perception that forms their foundation. Therefore the whole of knowledge in all its parts is permeated by it, and is valuable or troubling accordingly. With a small quantity but good quality of knowledge we achieve more than with a very great quantity but bad quality.\"\u2014from_The World as Will and Representation_.

  "There have been ample opportunities since 1945 to show that material superiority in war is not enough if the will to fight is lacking. In Algeria, Vietnam and Afghanistan the balance of economic and military strength lay overwhelmingly on the side of France, the United States, and the Soviet Union, but the will to win was slowly eroded. Troops became demoralised and brutalised. Even a political solution was abandoned. In all three cases the greater power withdrew. The Second World War was an altogether different conflict, but the will to win was every bit as important - indeed it was more so. The contest was popularly perceived to be about issues of life and death of whole communities rather than for their fighting forces alone. They were issues, wrote one American observer in 1939, 'worth dying for'. If, he continued, 'the will-to-destruction triumphs, our resolution to preserve civilisation must become more implacable...our courage must mount'.Words like 'will' and 'courage' are difficult for historians to use as instruments of cold analysis. They cannot be quantified; they are elusive of definition; they are products of a moral language that is regarded sceptically today, even tainted by its association with fascist rhetoric. German and Japanese leaders believed that the spiritual strength of their soldiers and workers in some indefinable way compensate for their technical inferiority. When asked after the war why Japan lost, one senior naval officer replied that the Japanese 'were short on spirit, the military spirit was weak...' and put this explanation ahead of any material cause. Within Germany, belief that spiritual strength or willpower was worth more than generous supplies of weapons was not confined to Hitler by any means, though it was certainly a central element in the way he looked at the world.The irony was that Hitler's ambition to impose his will on others did perhaps more than anything to ensure that his enemies' will to win burned brighter still. The Allies were united by nothing so much as a fundamental desire to smash Hitlerism and Japanese militarism and to use any weapon to achieve it. The primal drive for victory at all costs nourished Allied fighting power and assuaged the thirst for vengeance. They fought not only because the sum of their resources added up to victory, but because they wanted to win and were certain that their cause was just.The Allies won the Second World War because they turned their economic strength into effective fighting power, and turned the moral energies of their people into an effective will to win. The mobilisation of national resources in this broad sense never worked perfectly, but worked well enough to prevail. Materially rich, but divided, demoralised, and poorly led, the Allied coalition would have lost the war, however exaggerated Axis ambitions, however flawed their moral outlook. The war made exceptional demands on the Allied peoples. Half a century later the level of cruelty, destruction and sacrifice that it engendered is hard to comprehend, let alone recapture. Fifty years of security and prosperity have opened up a gulf between our own age and the age of crisis and violence that propelled the world into war. Though from today's perspective Allied victory might seem somehow inevitable, the conflict was poised on a knife-edge in the middle years of the war. This period must surely rank as the most significant turning point in the history of the modern age.": "Richard",

As he spoke, his voice was muffled against the horses's flank. \"he's becoming too much a creature of habit,\" he said. \"he's used that hide for the last three Gatherings. It's time he tried something new. Everyone must be onto it by now.\" Rangers constantly competed with each other to see before being seen and each year's Gathering was a time of heightened competition. Halt nodded thoughtfully. Crowley had constructed teh virtually invisible observation post some four years previously. Alone among the younger Rangers, Will had tumbled to it after one year. Halt had never mentioned to him that he was the only one who knew of Crowley's hide. The concealed post was the Ranger Commandant's pride and joy.  \"Well, perhaps not everyone,\" he said. Will emerged from behind his horse, grinning at the thought of the head of the Ranger Corps thinking he had remained hidden from sight as he watched Will's approach. \"All the same, perhaps he's getting a bit long in the tooth to be skulking around hiding in the bushes, don't you think?\" he said cheerfully. Halt considered the question for a moment.\"Long in the tooth? Well, that's one opinion. Mind you, his silent movement skills are still as good as ever,\" he said meaningfully. The grin on Will's face slowly faded. He resisted the temptation to look over his shoulder. \"He's standing behind me, isn't he?\" he asked Halt. THe older Ranger nodded. \"He's standing behind me, isn't he?\" Will continued and Halt nodded once more.\"Is he...close enough to have heard what I said?\" Will finally managed to ask, fearin teh worst. This time, Halt didn't have to answer. \"Oh, good grief no,\" came a familiar voice from behind him. \"he's so old and decrepit these days he's as deaf as a post.\"  Will's shoulders sagged and he turned to see the sandy-haired Commandant standing a few meters away. The younger man's eyes dropped. \"Hullo, Crowley,\" he said, then mumbled, \"Ahhh...I'm sorry about that.\" Crowley glared at teh young Ranger for a few more seconds, then he couldn't help teh grin breaking out on his face.  \"No harm done,\" he said, adding with a small note of triumph, \"It's not often these days I amange to get the better of one of you young ones.\" Secretly, he was impressed at teh news that Will had spotted his hiding place. Only the sarpest eyes could have picked it. Crowley had been in the business of seeing without being seen for thirty years or more, and despite what Will believed, he was still an absolute master of camouflage and unseen movement.": "John",
  "Halt! How are you? What have you been doing? Where's Abelard? How's Crowley? What's this all about?\" \"I'm glad to see you rate my horse more important than our Corps Commandant,\" Halt said, one eyebrow rising in the expression that Will knew so well. Early in their relationship, he had thought it was an expression of displeasure. He had learned years ago that it was, for Halt, the equivalent of a smile.": "John",
  "I can't - I'll chop off my own foot!\" \"If you're going to chop off anyone's foot, chop off Benedict's,\" Will muttered.": "Cassandra",
  "The the uncertainty was dispelled and the melancholy lifted as he saw a familiar stocky figure moving near one of the tents. \"Halt!\" he cried out gladly, and a slight pressure with his knees set Tug galloping through the deserted Gathering site. The dog, caught by surprise, barked once, then shot in pursuit like an arrow from a bow. The grim-faced Ranger straightened from the fire at the sound of his former student's voice. He stood, hands on hips and a frown on his face as Will and Tug careered toward him. But inside, there was a lightening of his heart that he never failed to feel when in Will's company. Not for the first time, the realization hit Halt that Will was no longer a mere boy. No one wore the Silver Oakleaf if he hadn't proven himself to be worthy. Despite himself, he felt a surge of pride.": "John",
  "How does the story really go?Does she ever cross your mind?Does she ever steal your nights?Is she still a part of you?Do you ever wish she were still by your side?And what would you do?If she walked up here tomorrow And told you that she loved you?Would you drop it all and run to her?Would you tell her you love her too?Or would you simply send her home?And tell her you\u2019ve moved on?Tell me, Buddy, what would you do?": "Laura",
  "Already, Cullum felt a stirring of interest. The name Horace and the mention of an oakleaf symbol struck a chord in his memory. Sir Horace, the Oakleaf Knight, was a legendary figure in Araluen, even in a place as remote as Norgate. Of course, the more remote the location, the more garbled and fantastic the legends became. As Cullum had hear tell, Sir Horace had been a youth of sixteen when he defeated the tyrant Morgarath in single combat, slicing the head off the evil lord's shoulders with one might strocke of a massive broadsword.Then, in the company of the equally legendary Ranger Halt, Sir Horace had traveled across the Stormwhite Sea to defeat the Riders from the East and rescue Princess Cassandra and her companion, the apprentice Ranger known as Will. Will! The significance of the name suddenly registered with the innkeeper. The jongleur's name was Will. Now here he was, in a cowled cloak, festooned with recurve bow and a quiver of arrows. He looked more closely and saw the hilt of a heavy saxe knife just visible at his waist. No doubt about it, Cullum thought, these cheerful young men were two of Araluen's greatest heroes!": "John",

  "Across that threshold I had been afraid to cross, things suddenly seemed so very simple. There was but a single vision, God, who was all in all; there was but one will that directed all things, God's will. I had only to see it, to discern it in every circumstance in which I found myself, and let myself be ruled by it. God is in all things, sustains all things, directs all things. To discern this in every situation and circumstance, to see His will in all things, was to accept each circumstance and situation and let oneself be borne along in perfect confidence and trust. Nothing could separate me from Him, because He was in all things. No danger could threaten me, no fear could shake me, except the fear of losing sight of Him. The future, hidden as it was, was hidden in His will and therefore acceptable to me no matter what it might bring. The past, with all its failures, was not forgotten; it remained to remind me of the weakness of human nature and the folly of putting any faith in self. But it no longer depressed me. I looked no longer to self to guide me, relied on it no longer in any way, so it could not again fail me. By renouncing, finally and completely, all control of my life and future destiny, I was relieved as a consequence of all responsibility. I was freed thereby from anxiety and worry, from every tension, and could float serenely upon the tide of God's sustaining providence in perfect peace of soul.": "Walter",

  "It became clear that Keisha Blake could not start something without finishing it.

This compulsion, applied to other fields, manifested itself as \"intelligence.\" Every unknown word sent her to a dictionary--in search of something like \"completion\"--and every book led to another book, a process that, of course, could never be completed. This route through early life gave her no small portion of joy, and, indeed, it seemed at first that her desires and her capacities were basically aligned. She wanted to read things--could not resist wanting to read things--and reading was easily done, and relatively inexpensive. On the other hand, that she should receive any praise for such reflexive habits baffled the girl, for she knew herself to be fantastically stupid about many things.

Such security, like paradise, is closed to man forever; man has to make choices. In addition to this, however, man has suffered another loss in his more recent development inasmuch as the traditions which buttressed his behavior are now rapidly diminishing. No instinct tells him what he has to do, and no tradition tells him what he ought to do; sometimes he does not even know what he wishes to do. Instead, he either wishes to do what other people do (conformism) or he does what other people tell him to do (totalitarianism).": "Viktor",

  "The Idiot. I have read it once, and find that I don't remember the events of the book very well--or even all the principal characters. But mostly the 'portrait of a truly beautiful person' that dostoevsky supposedly set out to write in that book. And I remember how Myshkin seemed so simple when I began the book, but by the end, I realized how I didn't understand him at all. the things he did. Maybe when I read it again it will be different. But the plot of these dostoevsky books can hold such twists and turns for the first-time reader-- I guess that's b/c he was writing most of these books as serials that had to have cliffhangers and such. But I make marks in my books, mostly at parts where I see the author's philosophical points standing in the most stark relief. My copy of Moby Dick is positively full of these marks. The Idiot, I find has a few... Part 3, Section 5. The sickly Ippolit is reading from his 'Explanation' or whatever its called. He says his convictions are not tied to him being condemned to death. It's important for him to describe, of happiness: \"you may be sure that Columbus was happy not when he had discovered America, but when he was discovering it.\" That it's the process of life--not the end or accomplished goals in it--that matter. Well. Easier said than lived! Part 3, Section 6. more of Ippolit talking--about a christian mindset. He references Jesus's parable of The Word as seeds that grow in men, couched in a description of how people are interrelated over time; its a picture of a multiplicity. Later in this section, he relates looking at a painting of Christ being taken down from the cross, at Rogozhin's house. The painting produced in him an intricate metaphor of despair over death \"in the form of a huge machine of the most modern construction which, dull and insensible, has aimlessly clutched, crushed, and swallowed up a great priceless Being, a Being worth all nature and its laws, worth the whole earth, which was created perhaps solely for the sake of the advent of this Being.\" The way Ippolit's ideas are configured, here, reminds me of the writings of Gilles Deleuze. And the phrasing just sort of remidns me of the way everyone feels--many people feel crushed by the incomprehensible machine, in life. Many people feel martyred in their very minor ways. And it makes me think of the concept that a narrative religion like Christianity uniquely allows for a kind of socialized or externalized, shared experience of subjectivity. Like, we all know the story of this man--and it feels like our own stories at the same time. Part 4, Section 7. Myshkin's excitement (leading to a seizure) among the Epanchin's dignitary guests when he talks about what the nobility needs to become (\"servants in order to be leaders\"). I'm drawn to things like this because it's affirming, I guess, for me: \"it really is true that we're absurd, that we're shallow, have bad habits, that we're bored, that we don't know how to look at things, that we can't understand; we're all like that.\" And of course he finds a way to make that into a good thing. which, it's pointed out by scholars, is very important to Dostoevsky philosophy--don't deny the earthly passions and problems in yourself, but accept them and incorporate them into your whole person.

  "Let us see what words can do. Will you understand me, for a start, if I tell you that I have never known what I am? My vices, my virtues, are under my nose, but I can\u2019t see them, nor stand far enough back to view myself as a whole. I seem to be a sort of flabby mass in which words are engulfed; no sooner do I name myself than what is named is merged in him who names, and one gets no farther. I have often wanted to hate myself and, as you know, had good reasons for so doing. But my attempted hatred of myself was absorbed into my insubstantiality and was nothing but a recollection. I could not love myself either, I am sure, though I have never tried to. But I was eternally compelled to be myself; I was my own burden, but never burdensome enough, Mathieu. For one instant, on that June evening when I elected to confess to you, I thought I had encountered myself in your bewildered eyes.You saw me, in your eyes I was solid and predictable; my acts and moods were the actual consequences of a definite entity. And through me you knew that entity. I described it to you in my words, I revealed to you facts unknown to you, which had helped you to visualize it. And yet you saw it, I merely saw you seeing it. For one instant you were the heaven-sent mediator between me and myself, you perceived that compact and solid entity which I was and wanted to be in just as simple and ordinary a way as I perceived you. For, after all, I exist, I am, though I have no sense of being; and it is an exquisite torment to discover in oneself such utterly unfounded certainty, such unsubstantiated pride. I then understood that one could not reach oneself except through another\u2019s judgment, another\u2019s hatred. And also through another\u2019s love perhaps; but there is here no question of that. For this revelation I am not ungrateful to you. I do not know how you would describe our present relations. Not goodwill, nor wholly hatred. Put it that there is a corpse between us.

  "The insistent drums were an unwelcome reminder of the existence of another world, wholly autonomous, with its own necessities and patterns. The message they were beating out, over and over, was for her; it was saying, not precisely that she did not exist but rather that it did not matter whether she existed or not, that her presence was of no consequence to the rest of the cosmos. It was a sensation that suddenly paralyzed her with dread. There had never been any question of her \u201cmattering\u201d; it went without saying that she mattered, because she was important to herself. But what was the part of her to which she mattered?": "Paul",
  "I do not know which impulse was stronger in me when I began to think: the original thirst for knowledge or the urge to communicate with man. Knowledge attains its full meaning only through the bond that unites men; however, the urge to achieve agreement with another human being was so hard to satisfy. I was shocked by the lack of understanding, paralyzed, as it were, by every reconciliation in which what had gone before was not fully cleared up. Early in my life and then later again and again I was perplexed by people\u2019s rigid inaccessibility and their failure to listen to reasons, their disregard of facts, their indifference which prohibited discussion, their defensive attitude which kept you at a distance and at the decisive moment buried any possibility of a close approach, and finally their shamelessness, that bares its own soul without reserve, as though no one were present. When ready assent occurred I remained unsatisfied, because it was not based on true insight but on yielding to persuasion; because it was the consequence of friendly cooperation, not a meeting of two selves. True, I knew the glory of friendship (in common studies, in the cordial atmosphere of home or countryside). But then came the moments of strangeness, as if human beings lived in different worlds. Steadily the consciousness of loneliness grew upon me in my youth, yet nothing seemed more pernicious to me than loneliness, especially the loneliness in the midst of social intercourse that deceives itself in a multitude of friendships. No urge seemed stronger to me than that for communication with others. If the never-completed movement of communication succeeds with but a single human being, everything is achieved. It is a criterion of this success that there be a readiness to communicate with every human being encountered and that grief is felt whenever communication fails. Not merely an exchange of words, nor friendliness and sociability, but only the constant urge towards total revelation reaches the path of communication.": "Karl",

To the man lost in the world and its diversions this anxiety is a brief, fleeting fear. But if that fear becomes conscious of itself, it becomes anguish, the perpetual climate of the lucid man \"in whom existence is concentrated.\" This professor of philosophy writes without trembling and in the most abstract language in the world that \"the finite and limited character of human existence is more primordial than man himself.\" His interest in Kant extends only to recognizing the restricted character of his \"pure Reason.\" This is to conclude at the end of his analyses that \"the world can no longer offer anything to the man filled with anguish.\" This anxiety seems to him so much more important than all the categories in the world that he thinks and talks only of it. He enumerates its aspects: boredom when the ordinary man strives to quash it in him and benumb it; terror when the mind contemplates death. He too does not separate consciousness from the absurd. The consciousness of death is the call of anxiety and \"existence then delivers itself its own summons through the intermediary of consciousness.\" It is the very voice of anguish and it adjures existence \"to return from its loss in the anonymous They.\" For him, too, one must not sleep, but must keep alert until the consummation.

Put the beautiful before you and the horror behind you. Yes, but then I shall not dare to turn round.The world is a bad place. Is it? But it seems that this haunting, this self-delusion by wearing blinkers, is not an attribute of the world. The haunting is in consciousness itself, in its very nature. Just as when I set up any object in the sunlight a shadow is cast (because it is the nature of sunlight to cast shadows), so anything that comes into the light of consciousness casts a shadow of the unknown. It is in the unknown that the horror resides in the dark of knowledge where the patterns can no longer be traced, where chaos resides, and whence utterly hostile systems may emerge, devour, and digest us.": "Nanamoli",
  "Human life, by its very nature, has to be dedicated to something, an enterprise glorious or humble, a destiny illustrious or trivial. We are faced with a condition, strange but inexorable, involved in our very existence. On the one hand, to live is something which each one does of himself and for himself. On the other hand, if that life of mine, which only concerns myself, is not directed by me towards something, it will be disjointed, lacking in tension and in \"form.\" In these years we are witnessing the gigantic spectacle of innumerable human lives wandering about lost in their own labyrinths, through not having anything to which to give themselves. All imperatives, all commands, are in a state of suspension. The situation might seem to be an ideal one, since every existence is left entirely free to do just as it pleases- to look after itself. The same with every nation. Europe has slackened its pressure on the world. But the result has been contrary to what might have been expected. Given over to itself, every life has been left empty, with nothing to do. And as it has to be filled with something, it invents frivolities for itself, gives itself to false occupations which impose nothing intimate, sincere. To-day it is one thing, to-morrow another, opposite to the first. Life is lost at finding itself all alone. Mere egoism is a labyrinth. This is quite understandable. Really to live is to be directed towards something, to progress towards a goal.": "Ortega",
  "For me, then, nobility is synonymous with a life of effort, ever set on excelling oneself, in passing beyond what one is to what one sets up as a duty and an obligation. In this way the noble life stands opposed to the common or inert life, which reclines statically upon itself, condemned to perpetual immobility, unless an external force compels it to come out of itself. Hence we apply the term mass to this kind of man- not so much because of his multitude as because of his inertia.": "Ortega",
  "That man is intellectually of the mass who, in face of any problem, is satisfied with thinking the first thing he finds in his head. On the contrary, the excellent man is he who contemns what he finds in his mind without previous effort, and only accepts as worthy of him what is still far above him and what requires a further effort in order to be reached.": "Ortega",
  "The mass-man would never have accepted authority external to himself had not his surroundings violently forced him to do so. As to-day, his surroundings do not so force him, the everlasting mass-man, true to his character, ceases to appeal to other authority and feels himself lord of his own existence. On the contrary the select man, the excellent man is urged, by interior necessity, to appeal from himself to some standard beyond himself, superior to himself, whose service he freely accepts. Let us recall that at the start we distinguished the excellent man from the common man by saying that the former is the one who makes great demands on himself, and the latter the one who makes no demands on himself, but contents himself with what he is, and is delighted with himself. * Contrary to what is usually thought, it is the man of excellence, and not the common man who lives in essential servitude. Life has no savour for him unless he makes it consist in service to something transcendental. Hence he does not look upon the necessity of serving as an oppression. When, by chance, such necessity is lacking, he grows restless and invents some new standard, more difficult, more exigent, with which to coerce himself. This is life lived as a discipline- the noble life. Nobility is defined by the demands it makes on us- by obligations, not by rights. Noblesse oblige. \"To live as one likes is plebeian; the noble man aspires to order and law\" (Goethe).": "Ortega",
  "But the man we are now analysing accustoms himself not to appeal from his own to any authority outside him. He is satisfied with himself exactly as he is. Ingenuously, without any need of being vain, as the most natural thing in the world, he will tend to consider and affirm as good everything he finds within himself: opinions, appetites, preferences, tastes. Why not, if, as we have seen, nothing and nobody force him to realise that he is a second-class man, subject to many limitations, incapable of creating or conserving that very organisation which gives his life the fullness and contentedness on which he bases this assertion of his personality?": "Ortega",
  "This leads us to note down in our psychological chart of the mass-man of to-day two fundamental traits: the free expansion of his vital desires, and therefore, of his personality; and his radical ingratitude towards an that has made possible the ease of his existence.

  "I have finished Russell's Nightmares and must confess that they did not come up to expectation. No doubt it was my fault for expecting too much, knowing how unsatisfactory I find his philosophical views; but I had hoped that, at least, when he was not writing normal philosophy, he would be entertaining. Alas! I found his wit insipid, and his serious passages almost intolerable\u2014there was something of the embarrassment of meeting a Great Man for the first time, and finding him even more preoccupied with trivialities than oneself.In his Introduction, Russell says 'Every isolated passion is, in isolation, insane; sanity may be defined as a synthesis of insanities', and then he proceeds to give us examples of isolated insanities\u2014the Queen of Sheba as Female Vanity, Bowdler as Prudery, the Psycho-Analyst as Social Conformity, and so on. Amongst these, as you noted, is the Existentialist as Ontological Scepticism. Here, Russell's satire is directed partly against what Sartre has called 'a literature of extreme situations'; and this, for an Englishman, is no doubt a legitimate target, since the English do not admit that there are such things\u2014though, of course, this makes the English a target for the satire of the rest of Europe, particularly the French.But what Russell is not entitled to do is to group the insanity of doubting one's existence along with the other insanities, and this for the simple reason that it precedes them. One may be vain or modest; one may be prudish or broadminded; one may be a social conformist or an eccentric; but in order to be any of these things, one must at least be. The question of one's existence must be settled first\u2014one cannot be insanely vain if one doubts whether one exists at all and, precisely, Russell's existentialist does not even succeed in suffering\u2014except when his philosophy is impugned (but this merely indicates that he has failed to apply his philosophy to itself, and not, as Russell would have us believe, because he has failed to regard his philosophy in the light of his other insanities). The trouble really is, that Russell does not, or rather will not, admit that existence poses a problem at all; and, since he omits this category from all his thinking nothing he says concerns anybody in particular.": "Nanavira",
  "Kafka is an ethical, not an aesthetic, writer. There is no conclusion to his books. The Castle was actually unfinished, but what ending could there be to it? And there is some doubt about the proper order of the chapters in The Trial\u2014it does not really seem to matter very much in which order you read them, since the book as a whole does not get you anywhere. (An uncharitable reader might disagree, and say that it throws fresh light on the Judiciary.) In this it is faithful to life as we actually experience it. There is no 'happy ending' or 'tragic ending' or 'comic ending' to life, only a 'dead ending'\u2014and then we start again.We suffer, because we refuse to be reconciled with this lamentable fact; and even though we may say that life is meaningless we continue to think and act as if it had a meaning. Kafka's heroes (or hero, 'K.'\u2014himself and not himself) obstinately persist in making efforts that they understand perfectly well are quite pointless\u2014and this with the most natural air in the world. And, after all, what else can one do? Notice, in The Trial, how the notion of guilt is taken for granted. K. does not question the fact that he is guilty, even though he does not know of what he is guilty\u2014he makes no attempt to discover the charge against him, but only to arrange for his defence. For both Kierkegaard and Heidegger, guilt is fundamental in human existence. (And it is only the Buddha who tells us the charge against us\u2014avijj\u0101.)": "Nanavira",
  "You will have noticed that my interpretation of The Trial as the account of a man who, at a certain point in his life, suddenly asks himself why he exists, and then considers various possible justifications for his existence until he is finally obliged to admit honestly to himself that there is no justification, corresponds to what I have said in the Preface to the Notes:Every man, at every moment of his life, is engaged in a perfectly definite concrete situation in a world that he normally takes for granted. But it occasionally happens that he starts to think. He becomes aware, obscurely, that he is in perpetual contradiction with himself and with the world in which he exists.The Trial describes what happens to a man when he starts to think: sooner or later he condemns himself as unjustified, and then despair begins (K.'s execution, the execution of hope, is the beginning of despair\u2014henceforth he is a dead man, like Connolly and Camus and so many other intelligent Europeans, and do what he may he can never quite forget it). It is only at this point that the Buddha's Teaching begins to be intelligible. But it must be remembered that for Connolly and the others, death at the end of this life is the final death, and the hell of despair in which they live will come to an end in a few years' time\u2014why, then, should they give up their distractions, when, if things get too bad, a bullet through their brain is enough? It is only when one understands that death at the end of this life is not the final end, that to follow the Buddha's Teaching is seen to be not a mere matter of choice but a matter of necessity.

  "Existentialism is commonly associated with Left-Bank Parisian cafes and the \u2018family\u2019 of philosophers Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir who gathered there in the years immediately following the liberation of Paris at the end of World War II. One imagines offbeat, avant-garde intellectuals, attached to their cigarettes, listening to jazz as they hotly debate the implications of their new-found political and artistic liberty. The mood is one of enthusiasm, creativity, anguished self-analysis, and freedom \u2013 always freedom.Though this reflects the image projected by the media of the day and doubtless captures the spirit of the time, it glosses over the philosophical significance of existentialist thought, packaging it as a cultural phenomenon of a certain historical period. That is perhaps the price paid by a manner of thinking so bent on doing philosophy concretely rather than in some abstract and timeless manner. The existentialists\u2019 urge for contemporary relevance fired their social and political commitment. But it also linked them with the problems of their day and invited subsequent generations to view them as having the currency of yesterday\u2019s news.Such is the misreading of existentialist thought that I hope to correct in this short volume. If it bears the marks of its post-war appearance, existentialism as a manner of doing philosophy and a way of addressing the issues that matter in people\u2019s lives is at least as old as philosophy itself. It is as current as the human condition which it examines.": "Thomas",
  "At the heart of existentialist philosophy is the premise that all existence is absurd. Life has no meaning and death is the ultimate absurdity, But in the course of this absurd existence, man is forced to make choices, even if those choices may be about absurd issues. But man abhors this freedom of choice, a condition called 'existential angst'. Until we reach a time when most of our life lies behind us, we second guess ourselves interminably. 'What if I had done done this?' 'What if I had done that?' 'Could I have learnt from what others before me have done?' But that is a futile endeavor. It is just not possible to pass on the burden of decision-making to someone else, nor is it possible to learn from other's experiences. Every man has to make choices by falling back on his own experience. In short, man is condemned to be free.": "Duvvuri",

But alone, under an unknown sky, what would happen to me? What truths would come suddenly to blind me? What chasms would open before me? Oh yes, chasms close, truths fade out - that is sure and certain; I've seen it happen often enough before. We're like those earthworms one vainly cuts in two, or those lobsters whose legs grow back again. But the moment of false agony, the moment you'd rather die than mend yourself once again - when I think of it, I lose heart. I try to reason with myself: 'Why should anything happen to me?

  "In the face of an obstacle which it is impossible to overcome, stubbornness is stupid. If I persist in beating my fist against a stone wall, my freedom exhausts itself in this useless gesture without succeeding in giving itself a content. It debases itself in a vain contingency. Yet, there is hardly a sadder virtue than resignation. It transforms into phantoms and contingent reveries projects which had at the beginning been set up as will and freedom. A young man has hoped for a happy or useful or glorious life. If the man he has become looks upon these miscarried attempts of his adolescence with disillusioned indifference, there they are, forever frozen in the dead past. When an effort fails, one declares bitterly that he has lost time and wasted his powers. The failure condemns that whole part of ourselves which we had engaged in the effort. It was to escape this dilemma that the Stoics preached indifference. We could indeed assert our freedom against all constraint if we agreed to renounce the particularity of our projects. If a door refuses to open, let us accept not opening it and there we are free. But by doing that, one manages only to save an abstract notion of freedom. It is emptied of all content and all truth. The power of man ceases to be limited because it is annulled. It is the particularity of the project which determines the limitation of the power, but it is also what gives the project its content and permits it to be set up. There are people who are filled with such horror at the idea of a defeat that they keep themselves from ever doing anything.

This affords us an idea of challenge-and-response which is much deeper and more decisive than the merely anecdotal, adventitious, and accidental idea which Toynbee proposes.

A sick one did I resemble, whom bad torture wearieth, and a worse dream reawakeneth out of his first sleep.\u2014But there is something in me which I call courage: it hath hitherto slain for me every dejection. This courage at last bade me stand still and say: \"Dwarf! Thou! Or I!\"\u2014For courage is the best slayer,\u2014courage which attacketh: for in every attack there is sound of triumph.Man, however, is the most courageous animal: thereby hath he overcome every animal. With sound of triumph hath he overcome every pain; human pain, however, is the sorest pain.Courage slayeth also giddiness at abysses: and where doth man not stand at abysses! Is not seeing itself\u2014seeing abysses?Courage is the best slayer: courage slayeth also fellow-suffering. Fellow-suffering, however, is the deepest abyss: as deeply as man looketh into life, so deeply also doth he look into suffering.Courage, however, is the best slayer, courage which attacketh: it slayeth even death itself; for it saith: \"Was that life? Well! Once more!": "Friedrich",

  "At this stage of the game, I don\u2019t have the time for patience and tolerance. Ten years ago, even five years ago, I would have listened to people ask their questions, explained to them, mollified them. No more. That time is past. Now, as Norman Mailer said in Naked and the Dead, \u2018I hate everything which is not in myself.\u2019 If it doesn\u2019t have a direct bearing on what I\u2019m advocating, if it doesn\u2019t augment or stimulate my life and thinking, I don\u2019t want to hear it. It has to add something to my life. There\u2019s no more time for explaining and being ecumenical anymore. No more time. That\u2019s a characteristic I share with the new generation of Satanists, which might best be termed, and has labeled itself in many ways, an \u2018Apocalypse culture.\u2019 Not that they believe in the biblical Apocalypse\u2014the ultimate war between good and evil. Quite the contrary. But that there is an urgency, a need to get on with things and stop wailing and if it ends tomorrow, at least we\u2019ll know we\u2019ve lived today. It\u2019s a \u2018fiddle while Rome burns\u2019 philosophy. It\u2019s the Satanic philosophy. If the generation born in the 50\u2019s grew up in the shadow of The Bomb and had to assimilate the possibility of imminent self destruction of the entire planet at any time, those born in the 60\u2019s have had to reconcile the inevitability of our own destruction, not through the bomb but through mindless, uncontrolled overpopulation. And somehow resolve in themselves, looking at what history has taught us, that no amount of yelling, protesting, placard waving, marching, wailing\u2014or even more constructive avenues like running for government office or trying to write books to wake people up\u2014is going to do a damn bit of good. The majority of humans have an inborn death wish\u2014they want to destroy themselves and everything beautiful. To finally realize that we\u2019re living in a world after the zenith of creativity, and that we can see so clearly the mechanics of our own destruction, is a terrible realization. Most people can\u2019t face it. They\u2019d rather retreat to the comfort of New Age mysticism. That\u2019s all right. All we want, those few of us who have the strength to realize what\u2019s going on, is the freedom to create and entertain and share with each other, to preserve and cherish what we can while we can, and to build our own little citadels away from the insensitivity of the rest of the world.": "Anton",

In eternity no other chance will be given to us.A mind hearing this pitiless warning--a warning which, at the same time, is so compassionate--would decide to conquer its weakness and meanness, its laziness and vain hopes and cling with all its power to every second which flies away forever.Great examples come to your mind and you see clearly that you are a lost soul, your life is being frittered away on petty pleasures and pains and trifling talk. \"Shame!
