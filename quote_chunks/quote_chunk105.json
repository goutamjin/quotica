  "But with Christ, we have access in a one-to-one relationship, for, as in the Old Testament, it was more one of worship and awe, a vertical relationship. The New Testament, on the other hand, we look across at a Jesus who looks familiar, horizontal. The combination is what makes the Cross.": "Bono",
  "I remember my mom bought me one of their shirts for Easter so that I could wear Helmut Lang for Easter. That was my first piece.": "Travis",
  "I don't really care what people tell children - when you believe in Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny and the Tooth Fairy, one more fib won't hurt. But I am infuriated by the growing notion, posited in some touchy-feely quarters, that all women are, or can be, beautiful.": "Julie",
  "Each year in early spring, during the season of Lent, which begins on Ash Wednesday and concludes on Easter, a plenitude of books, magazine articles, and television shows about Jesus appear.": "Jay",
  "In the past, I've visited remote places - North Korea, Ethiopia, Easter Island - partly as a way to visit remote states of mind: remote parts of myself that I wouldn't ordinarily explore.": "Pico",

  "For those of you who still believe in the Easter Bunny and that the letters that appear in your local newspaper come from concerned citizens who really care, I've got troubling news. At least in politics, most of the letters that get published on the letters-to-the-editor page originate in the campaign headquarters of the candidates.": "Peter",
  "Fortunately, the DC Universe is full enough and replete enough with every kind of character that you could want, that it's not that hard to find the right character. Sometimes it's nothing more than an Easter egg, or a name drop, and sometimes it's someone like 'Deathstroke,' who is a huge part of the DC Universe.": "Marc",
  "At one time I smoked, but in 1959 I couldn't think of anything else to give up for Lent so I stopped - and I haven't had a cigarette since.": "Ethel",

  "Winning the 2007 Master's was a dream fulfilled culminating on Easter Sunday with my family was very special. You couldn't write it up any better.": "Zach",
  "I had my boy in Boston on Easter Sunday. That kills me, from a sports perspective. He's a Boston baby and I'm a New York guy.": "Kevin",
  "Let every man and woman count himself immortal. Let him catch the revelation of Jesus in his resurrection. Let him say not merely, 'Christ is risen,' but 'I shall rise.'": "Phillips",
  "Do we believe that there is equal economic opportunity out there in the real world, right now, for each and every one of these groups? If we believed in the tooth fairy, if we believed in the Easter Bunny, we might well believe that.": "William",
  "I cooked at the White House for Easter, last year, with Michelle Obama. But it more had to do with cooking from the organic garden, and her message. I took my daughter and granddaughter there, and they were really charming, it was great.": "Jacques",
  "I read the Scriptures at the American Cathedral on Christmas and Easter that's it. It's a task I love.": "Olivia",
  "Between the three, Facebook is literally everyone I've ever shaken hands with at a conference or kissed on the cheek at Easter. Twitter seems to be everyone I am entertained by or I wish to meet some day. Foursquare seems to be everyone I run into on a regular basis. All three of those social graphs are powerful in their own.": "Dennis",
  "I was raised - and still consider myself to be - Catholic, though I'm non-practicing and haven't fulfilled my Easter duty since sometime during the Nixon years. I'm assailed by all kinds of stimulating doubts, but I do believe in God.": "Thomas",
  "God expects from men something more than at such times, and that it were much to be wished for the credit of their religion as well as the satisfaction of their conscience that their Easter devotions would in some measure come up to their Easter dress.": "Robert",
  "To a Christian, Easter Sunday means everything, when we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ.": "Bernhard",
  "Passover and Easter are the only Jewish and Christian holidays that move in sync, like the ice skating pairs we saw during the winter Olympics.": "Marvin",
  "My passion was to be on Broadway and to be part of this community because I saw what it was like from the outside as the young kid in and around New York, and I would see things like the 'Easter Bonnet' or 'Broadway Bares,' things I would sneak into.": "Max",
  "What makes you a Christian is whether or not you really are in accord with biblical theology and whether you know Jesus Christ as your Saviour.": "Walter",
  "And it is always Easter Sunday at the New York City Ballet. It is always coming back to life. Not even coming back to life - it lives in the constant present.": "John",
  "I am very proud of this work because it is more about the meaning of the Easter Rising and its relationship to what this whole century has been about, people liberating themselves, freeing themselves.": "Leon",
  "To see how Christ was prophesied and described therein, consider and mark, how that the kid or lamb must be with out spot or blemish; and so was Christ only of all mankind, in the sight of God and of his law.": "William",

  "When you ran out the tunnel at the old Easter Road for a derby game, you'd get a spittal right on the back of your head. They were spitting on you as you ran out, which actually helped get you going. It was some place.": "Drew",

  "Just keep taking chances and having fun.": "Garth",

  "Chance is always powerful. Let your hook always be cast; in the pool where you least expect it, there will be fish.": "Ovid",
  "If we choose to walk into a forest where a tiger lives, we are taking a chance. If we swim in a river where crocodiles live, we are taking a chance. If we visit the desert or climb a mountain or enter a swamp where snakes have managed to survive, we are taking a chance.": "Peter",

  "My sole ambition is to rid Mexico of the class that has oppressed her and given the people a chance to know what real liberty means. And if I could bring that about today by giving up my life, I would do it gladly.": "Pancho",
  "Atheism is so senseless. When I look at the solar system, I see the earth at the right distance from the sun to receive the proper amounts of heat and light. This did not happen by chance.": "Isaac",

  "Do you want to be safe and good, or do you want to take a chance and be great?": "Jimmy",
  "What makes us Americans is our shared commitment to an ideal - that all of us are created equal, and all of us have the chance to make of our lives what we will.": "Barack",
  "It's not how you start the season, it's how you finish. If you wind up helping the team make the playoffs, that's what you play for. You don't play to put up your numbers, but to try to get a chance to make it to the World Series.": "Albert",
  "Coffee has always been a significant part of my life. For me, it's a chance to start my day and gather my thoughts - it's fuel for my creative process.": "Connor",

  "The longer you hang in there, the greater the chance that something will happen in your favor. No matter how hard it seems, the longer you persist, the more likely your success.": "Jack",
  "A complaint is a chance to turn a customer into a lifelong friend. I say that seriously, not as some press release baloney.": "Richard",
  "I have never entered into any controversy in defense of my philosophical opinions; I leave them to take their chance in the world. If they are right, truth and experience will support them; if wrong, they ought to be refuted and rejected. Disputes are apt to sour one's temper and disturb one's quiet.": "Benjamin",

  "If you turn a smiling face on the world, you've got a chance of finishing up a good-looking old person.": "Rolf",
  "Where there is a will, there is a way. If there is a chance in a million that you can do something, anything, to keep what you want from ending, do it. Pry the door open or, if need be, wedge your foot in that door and keep it open.": "Pauline",

  "If you don't take the chance to live life, what can you say at the end of it?": "Naveen",

  "Colorful garments - ball gowns, kimonos, evening pajamas - made from yards upon yards of iridescent silk or velvet. I own an unjustifiable number of such outfits and jump at the chance to wear them. Against the etiquette about which I am otherwise all too conscious, I frequently, and unrepentantly, overdress for the occasion.": "Julia",
  "If no one ever took risks, Michaelangelo would have painted the Sistine floor.": "Neil",
  "Don't listen to anybody. Nobody knows the magic bullet. If they did, they'd sell it and make a fortune. Follow your gut. Follow your instincts. Every once in a while, take a chance.": "Michael",

  "The great thing about getting older is that you get a chance to tell the people in your life who matter what they mean to you.": "Mike",
  "The optimist underestimates how difficult it is to achieve real change, believing that anything is possible and it's possible now. Only by confronting head-on the reality that all progress is going to be obstructed by vested interests and corrupted by human venality can we create realistic programmes that actually have a chance of success.": "Julian",
  "Stuff doesn't matter - boats, cars, fancy things don't matter. What matters, what will matter to me, is the love of the people around me, and did I take a chance? Did I seize an opportunity to do something for people with the talents that I was lucky enough to be given? Did I make a difference in the lives of people who needed me?": "James",

  "So when you get a chance to look at things and chill and relax, it makes you want it more, and that's why I'm so happy to be back!": "Brandy",

  "I believe that fate is choices - it's not chance.": "Wayne",

  "Good luck has its storms.": "George",
  "Problems can be experienced as... a chance for renewal rather than stress.": "Marilyn",
  "We don't get a chance to do that many things, and every one should be really excellent. Because this is our life. Life is brief, and then you die, you know? So this is what we've chosen to do with our life.": "Steve",
  "Being lazy does not mean that you do not create. In fact, lying around doing nothing is an important, nay crucial, part of the creative process. It is meaningless bustle that actually gets in the way of productivity. All we are really saying is, give peace a chance.": "Tom",
  "I had been asking the universe and God to send me a way for me to help me. Show business has been so wonderful to me, and it came in the form of that. It's just so funny how things come into your life, and if you take a chance on them, it might give you a brand new life.": "Louie",
  "Louis Pasteur said, 'Chance favors the prepared mind.' If you're really engaged in the writing, you'll work yourself out of whatever jam you find yourself in.": "Michael",

  "I mean we all need a second chance sometimes.": "Joel",
  "I always say that polo, for you to pursue a career, mainly any sport, you have to be born in the right place. If you're born in Hawaii, you surf. If you're born in Austria, you probably will ski. If you're born in Argentina, you most likely ride horses and have a chance to play polo.": "Nacho",

  "A film like 'Good Night And Good Luck,' you make that for $7 million because you know it's a black-and-white film, and it's not an easy sell. If you make it for $7 million, then everybody can have a chance to make a little bit of money, and you get to make the film you want to make.": "Grant",
  "The criteria for serving one's country should be competence, courage and willingness to serve. When we deny people the chance to serve because of their sexual orientation, we deprive them of their rights of citizenship, and we deprive our armed forces the service of willing and capable Americans.": "Dianne",

  "Wealthy men can't live in an island that is encircled by poverty. We all breathe the same air. We must give a chance to everyone, at least a basic chance.": "Ayrton",
  "You're not going to eliminate concussions. Anytime you hit your head, you have a chance of getting a concussion, in any sport, too. I think we have to learn more about it. Part of it is rules, part of it is equipment, part of it is medical studies, knowing more about the brain.": "John",

  "Luck, that's when preparation and opportunity meet.": "Pierre",
  "The more I come to know about the outside world's perception of China, the more I feel there are all sorts of misunderstandings, and to a certain extent, people do not get the full picture from the media.

  "When you're a chef, you graze. You never get a chance to sit down and eat. They don't actually sit down and eat before you cook. So when I finish work, the first thing I'll do, and especially when I'm in New York, I'll go for a run. And I'll run 10 or 15k on my - and I run to gain my appetite.": "Gordon",
  "Credit card companies are jacking up interest rates, lowering credit limits, and closing accounts - and people who have made timely payments are not exempt.

  "If you have a dream, give it a chance to happen.": "Richard",

  "Falling in love, romance, matters of the heart - when you fall in love, on some biochemical level you know there is a chance it won't work out. It's ingrained in us that if you take such an enormous risk on someone with your heart that it might not pay off. I gamble all my chips and I might actually lose everything.": "Rachael",

  "I love baseball. The game allowed me the influence to impact kids in a positive way. This gives me a chance to talk to some social issues.": "Cal",
  "Unless you burst into movies as a sex goddess, you're likely to play wives and mothers. I came into movies as a teenager in 'They Shoot Horses, Don't They' (1969) playing a pregnant waif from the Ozarks. I didn't get a chance to burst into movies in 'Body Heat.' My career isn't based on having a 23-inch waist and a big bust, though I do.": "Bonnie",

  "I think that if you have a knack for storytelling, and you work really hard at it, you'll have a chance to tap into something deep. But the fact remains that good sentences are hard won. Any writer worth a lick knows constructing a sentence, a paragraph, or a chapter is hard work.": "Adam",

  "We try to create a situation where we're the casino. It's like how an actuary would set insurance rates. Predictability, predictability, predictability. What's the path to least risk? What's the greater chance of getting some return on this asset?": "Billy",
  "I'd never taken a job purely for money - I felt that would kill me - but I was afraid that I was heading that way. Then, my brother passing away was the final thing that kicked me over. It reminded me that life is short, and you'd better do what you want while you have a chance.": "Mark",

  "I don't even know how to speak up for myself, because I don't really have a father who would give me the confidence or advice. And if you're always the new kid, you never get a chance to adapt, so your confidence is just zilch.": "Eminem",
  "The former colonies, in Latin America in particular, have a better chance than ever before to overcome centuries of subjugation, violence and foreign intervention, which they have so far survived as dependencies with islands of luxury in a sea of misery.": "Noam",
  "I really don't like the gym. I like experiences, so I take any chance I get to go on a bicycle or on a hike.": "Blake",

  "I actually hated dancing. My mum used to have to bribe me to go by buying me things. A year before I stopped going, I was going to go for an audition with the Royal Ballet. It turned out I was a year too young. Because I was tall, they thought I was older. But before I had the chance to go back, I quit.": "Katarina",
  "I'm actually an evangelical atheist, but there is something I recognise about religion: that it gives people a chance to surrender.": "Brian",
  "The great opportunity belongs to him who can see it, to him who can grasp it. The better part of your chance is right inside of you.": "Orison",
  "As a comedian, you want people to like you. That's part of why you're there in the first place: You have this unquenchable need to be liked, and then when you divert from that and take a chance at doing something that has moments of fierce unlikeability, you can hit some real low points.": "Mike",
  "Voting shouldn't be a challenge. It should be as easy and accessible as possible. We shouldn't require forms of ID that folks don't have. We shouldn't restrict days or hours that allow working people a chance to both do their job and exercise their democratic right, and we damn well shouldn't be throwing up new obstacles midstream.": "Donna",
  "A lot of people head into courtship looking for fireworks. Don't pass up a chance by dumping someone after a first date because you don't feel the fireworks. The fireworks can happen at any time and be maintained.": "Helen",

  "It's been a struggle for me because I had a chance to be white and refused.": "Richard",
  "You can't sit on a lead and run a few plays into the line and just kill the clock. You've got to throw the ball over the damn plate and five the other man his chance. That's why baseball is the greatest game of them all.": "Earl",
  "We are given to the cult of personality; when things go badly we look to some messiah to save us. If by chance we think we have found one, it will not be long before we destroy him.": "Constantine",

  "Remember to be gentle with yourself and others. We are all children of chance and none can say why some fields will blossom while others lay brown beneath the August sun.": "Kent",
  "I am constantly struggling to show people that there is more to me than my appearance. You do have to try and overcome those hurdles. Female actresses need to be given the chance to be more than how they look.": "Amber",
  "With commentating, I've had a chance to show the humorous side of my personality that I didn't use on the court. It's fun, and I don't take myself too seriously. I have good broadcast teams with me, but I'm not a huge stats guy. I think they post the numbers too quickly, and I'd rather let the match play out a bit first.": "John",
  "One must not make oneself cheap here - that is a cardinal point - or else one is done. Whoever is most impertinent has the best chance.": "Wolfgang",
  "You know, from my point of view, I'm the luckiest cat on the planet.": "Hugh",

  "It is true that the Puritans banned all recreation on Sundays and all games of chance, gambling, bear baiting, horse racing, and bowling in or around taverns at all times. They did so, not because they were opposed to fun, but because they judged these activities to be inherently harmful or immoral.": "Leland",

  "If one has curiosity, then one stands the chance of attain a high level of scientific inquiry.": "Ada",
  "Marathon running, like golf, is a game for players, not winners. That is why Callaway sells golf clubs and Nike sells running shoes.

  "While there is a chance of the world getting through its troubles, I hold that a reasonable man has to behave as though he were sure of it. If at the end your cheerfulness in not justified, at any rate you will have been cheerful.": "H.",

  "Poker is a skill game pretending to be a chance game.": "James",
  "I'm all about taking chances. You have to ask yourself, if you're not taking any chances, are you actually even living? Every time you walk out of your door and you're out in the world, you take a chance on not coming back. That is the danger and the dynamic of being alive.": "CeeLo",
  "The chance of any species reaching and then surviving on an island as distant as one of the Hawaiian chain is infinitesimal, but despite the extraordinary odds, plants and seeds found their way ashore, carried by the tide or blown by trade winds, inside birds or in their feathers, in the branches of trees and in the jetsam of sunken ships.": "Susanna",

  "If Donald Trump is our nominee, I don't think that he represents the best our party has to offer either in temperament or qualification, and I think he's the weakest candidate that is in the race at this point in terms of the general election, and that to nominate him is to give Hillary Clinton a much better chance of being president.": "Trent",
  "I want a president with a record of public service: someone whose life's work shows our children that we don't chase form and fortune for ourselves we fight to give everyone a chance to succeed. ": "Michelle",

  "It's good to have a lot of once-in-a-lifetimes in your lifetime. If you get the chance to skydive, go skydiving. If you're offered a part in a weird Shakespeare play in San Diego, slap on some tights and rock out some iambic pentameter.": "Neil",
  "You never know in TV - sometimes you're on at the wrong time at the wrong place. Sometimes you don't get a chance to catch on.": "Larry",

  "I have a novel that I can write. It's about three soldiers from Somalia.

  "What I felt was, if you spend your life just writing fiction, you are going to falsify your material.

  "With physical prep work, you know if you go to the gym, you will get size. There's no chance it won't happen. The emotional prep work is a variable.

  "I am so grateful to Marc Jacobs, Riccardo Tisci, Karl Lagerfeld, and Katie Grand, who took a chance on me that first season and gave me an opportunity.": "Kendall",
  "I was thinking recently about the popularity of TV shows about people shopping for houses. I wonder if part of their appeal is the chance to vicariously imagine our lives playing out in a variety of spaces. We have a sense that the shape and style of our dwellings affects the shapes of the lives that unfold within them.": "Mary",
  "Given a fair shot, given a fair chance, Americans have never, ever, ever, ever let their country down. Never. Never. Ordinary people like us. Who do extraordinary things.": "Joe",

  "Standing on the apex of our planet is humbling. I'm starved of oxygen, depleted of reserves, unable to eat, and bound by anxiety. This is a dangerous place. Yet the symbolism of standing on top of the world gives me a chance to experience time on a cosmic scale.": "Conrad",
  "The next wave of the social graph is empowering services like Airbnb and Lyft that give people the chance to have that physical interaction. People are more open to that because of Airbnb. Airbnb took couch surfing and took an additional step.": "John",

  "If I wasn't prepared knowing every year there is a huge chance of a fire that will require me to evacuate my property, then I'm an ignoramus. If people at this point don't see that terrorism is a reality, and don't take steps to prepare themselves a little more than they were the day before, then they are also an irresponsible ignoramus.": "Bill",
  "When Justice White retired, he gave me the chance to work for Justice Kennedy, as well. Justice Kennedy was incredibly welcoming and gracious, and like Justice White, he taught me so much. I am forever grateful. And if you've ever met Judge David Sentelle, you'll know just how lucky I was to land a clerkship with him right out of school.": "Neil",
  "Certain scripts require an ensemble cast. I'm absolutely fine with that. I will not deprive myself of the chance to be part of a good film because of insecurities or fear of losing my market. But my role must be well-defined.": "Kajal",
  "You get a chance like that maybe once in your lifetime, and you are lucky to sustain it over that period of time. It doesn't mean to say that whatever I do in the future has no substance to it - I may present some new material I've got, and there are definitely new angles of doing it - but I'm not looking to recreate another Led Zeppelin.": "Jimmy",
  "The thing I like about college football so much is you can affect these guys a lot more when they are 18-22, 23 years old in terms of people and having a chance to be more successful. They are still a value type development, where you have a chance to help them mature a bit and help them be a little more successful in life.": "Nick",
  "I took all my blessings for granted. The fact that God has given me another chance to do what I love to do, and still have my husband and my children and my sanity and good people in my corner, I'm gonna do it right this time and show that I appreciate it.": "Remy",
  "Entrepreneurs spend an inordinate amount of time inside of our own heads - thinking, analyzing, agonizing and obsessing over every little detail of our business. Sometimes, we need a break from ourselves. Meditation is a chance to let the thinking mind rest.": "Lewis",

  "Give your subconscious a chance to work by turning your brain off from time to time. Don't focus on work or solving problems constantly.": "Harvey",
  "I've become more and more aware of the promise and struggle to teach the global mind nowadays because I use every chance I get to ask faculty and administrators of management education programs why we don't offer at least one course - not even required, just an elective - on the world's religions.": "Warren",

  "Just, whenever you can, get up and sing at a gig or jam. If you have a chance, take it and keep on getting up. Keep going - but not If people boo, 'cause that's just mean. I think that could be setting yourself for disappointment.": "Sia",
  "I just remember watching Federer the first year he won Wimbledon. He was struggling with his back problem. I remember it vividly. It looked like there was a chance he was not going to finish. He had that look in his eye. Then, somehow, he found the wherewithal to dig a little deeper, and suddenly he wins the thing, and he's a different player.": "John",
  "Variety is very, very good. Going from medium to medium, if you get the chance to do it, from theater to television to film, which are all distinctly different, keeps me sharp. What works in one doesn't work in the other, and you have to be looking for the truth of the performance, whatever way that medium might demand.": "Kenneth",

  "You can choose a future where more Americans have the chance to gain the skills they need to compete, no matter how old they are or how much money they have. Education was the gateway to opportunity for me. It was the gateway for Michelle. And now more than ever, it is the gateway to a middle-class life.": "Barack",

  "It's a great experience. If you get a chance to run for president, do it.": "Mitt",
  "The only way to win the White House, in my view, is to become a nominee of either the Republican or the Democrat Party, and simply running to be a spoiler would not give the American people, I think, the chance to express their own views about Mr. Trump or about Secretary Clinton.": "Mitt",

  "Though men are apt to flatter and exalt themselves with their great achievements, yet these are, in truth, very often owing not so much to design as chance.": "Francois",
  "For my very first movie, 'Roger and Me,' I made it as part of my deal with Warner Brothers that the four people that were evicted in that film, that Warner Brothers would house - would pay their mortgage or their rent for the next two years to give them a chance to get on their feet.": "Michael",
  "If you knew that your life was merely a phase or short, short segment of your entire existence, how would you live? Knowing nothing 'real' was at risk, what would you do? You'd live a gigantic, bold, fun, dazzling life. You know you would. That's what the ghosts want us to do - all the exciting things they no longer can.": "Chuck",
  "I'm not questioning Dick Cheney's motives. There's a chance for a conflict of interest. At one point in time, he was opposed to going into Baghdad. Then he was out of office and involved in the defense industry, and then he became for going into Baghdad.": "Rand",
  "I have a second chance on life.": "Katy",
  "When you face a 'performance' that might provoke the 'I'm scared' response, choose love and approach your opportunity as a chance to dance with God. It's more fun than 'Dancing with the Stars!'": "Wayne",

  "Producing is so exciting because you can enable things to happen, whether it's like discovering a filmmaker who you're taking a chance on, protecting a battle and driving home at the end of the day just going, 'I'm so glad I stayed late at work and fought hard for that. Had my passion. Won that battle.'": "Drew",
  "When the purse strings tighten up at museums, the institutions usually cut back and cancel shows. That's exactly the wrong reaction.

  "Part of the problem with the discovery of the so-called breast-cancer genes was that physicians wrongly told women that had the genetic changes associated with the genes that they had a 99% chance of getting breast cancer.

  "My sister learned she was a carrier for a recessive disease, Bloom syndrome, late in one of her pregnancies. I remember the panicked call and the weeks of worry as she and her husband awaited his test results; if he was also a carrier, this meant their daughter had a one in four chance of being born with the disorder.": "Anne",

  "Just the idea of seeing a type of narrative we've not seen before is a chance to be surprised.": "Elvis",

  "I never do anything by chance.": "Brigitte",
  "The one thing I think I've noticed about shows that are supposed to be funny on television is that they've sort of become routinized, so there's an awful lot of mannerisms and joke lines that are sort of there to trigger laughter, rather than give actors a chance to play a moment.": "Alan",
  "In the early '70s - a very good time for children's books and their authors - editors and publishers were willing to take a chance on a new writer. They were willing and able to invest their time in nurturing writers with promise, encouraging them.": "Judy",

  "I hope people don't compare 2D and 3D because 3D's new, it's unfair to compare to 2D which is really sophisticated, even when we're jaded about it. 3D just began, give it a chance, let the equipment and projection system catch up and be better, let the price go down, let more filmmakers get a hold of it more easily.": "Ang",

  "I take risks - that's my life on the slopes and off.": "Lindsey",
  "Any swagger is just defense. When you're reminded so much of who you are by people - not a fame thing, but with my size, constantly, growing up - you just either curl up in a corner in the dark or you wear it proudly, like armor or something. You can turn it on its head and use it yourself before anybody else gets a chance.": "Peter",
  "Without a doubt, absolutely, a woman will be a president, and probably sooner rather than later. I am excited about that, and if what I did serves as a steppingstone for another woman down the course, I am very grateful to have had that chance.": "Michele",
  "I don't know Hollywood very well. I've never lived in Los Angeles or New York. But what I can see in Paris, where I live, is that actresses like Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Charlotte Rampling, still get the chance to play strong, sexy roles even though they're not 20.": "Monica",
  "We owe it to all our veterans to make sure they have a chance to achieve the American Dream, just like the rest of us.": "Tammy",
  "In my 20s, life seemed endless. At 49, I've had a chance to see how dark life can be, and I am far more aware of the constraints of time than when I wrote 'The Kite Runner.' I realise there is only a limited number of things I can do.": "Khaled",

  "I'm the one who will take chances, not worry about the backlash.": "Magic",
  "I have to say that if our global alliances are going to be alliances with Hezbollah and Hamas and Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and Vladimir Putin's Russia, there is absolutely no chance of building a world-wide alliance that can deal with poverty and inequality and climate change and financial instability, and we've got to face up to that fact.": "Gordon",

  "I had a really dark time after the Olympic Games... But then I said to myself, 'This is a sport that's blessed me with a home, with an education, with some money. I can't hate this sport.

  "At a certain point, if you still have your marbles and are not faced with serious financial challenges, you have a chance to put your house in order.

And some of the other actors on 'Sister, Sister' were like, 'Do you know that's like a 1%, 2% chance for you to get another successful show? That just doesn't happen.'

  "I do think taking the 20s to take the most chances you can is important, because you're not going to hurt anyone else during that time. And if you do have a partner, you need a couple years to rehearse that relationship.": "Gail",

  "The fact 'Twin Peaks' had a life at all took most of us in the cast by surprise. We thought it would be too unusual for network television.

  "It's sad when you see most of your friends in the business gone, like Tommy Cooper, Frankie Howard, Eric Morecambe, Roy Castle, Les Dawson. They were very dear to me. You no longer have the chance to bump into them at a celebrity do.": "Bruce",
  "I lucked out when I started to sing. I'd already experienced failing at everything else.": "Cyndi",
  "I think people who are not rich can be extremely happy. And I think the chances to be happy in this new world - with many more opportunities to be creative, to be online, to educate yourself - there'll be a lot more chances to be happy. It's not to say everyone will take them, but there will be a lot of new paths to opportunity.": "Tyler",

  "According to a new survey, 40 percent of adults in Mexico say they would move to the United States if they got a chance. The number would have been higher, but the other 60 percent already live here.": "Conan",
  "Nothing can ever happen twice. In consequence, the sorry fact is that we arrive here improvised and leave without the chance to practice.": "Wislawa",
  "Cheap labor is a small part of the problem at work here. If it were only cheap labor, America would be in trouble. Because it's other things, too, we have a great chance to turn it around. Here's the problem: Our high corporate tax rate pushes our companies offshore. Our high regulatory burden pushes our companies offshore.": "Peter",
  "I met my wife through playing golf. She is French and couldn't speak English and I couldn't speak French, so there was little chance of us getting involved in any boring conversations - that's why we got married really quickly.": "Sean",
  "I've been doing Pride and Prejudice all summer, so suddenly the chance to be holed up with a bunch of marines is quite attractive, and probably a necessary dose of male energy.": "Rosamund",
  "I thought theater people wouldn't see me if I hadn't trained. I didn't want to just be the Brideshead guy, to spend the rest of my life wearing waistcoats. I got the chance to try everything. Not just Romeos, but pimps and grandfathers and even one role as a woman in a Naomi Wallace play called Slaughter City.": "Tom",
  "When my job was attempting to predict future economic developments for the Shell oil company, I was frequently reminded of an Arabic saying: 'Those who claim to foresee the future are lying, even if by chance they are later proved right.'": "Vince",

  "It sometimes seems to me that the whole course of English history was one of accident, confusion, chance and unintended consequences - there's no real pattern.": "Peter",
  "I wasn't going to be an actor. I was going to be a lawyer. I came from a family just above working class, just below middle class, a great family of wonderful values. The idea of me having a chance for a law degree was enticing. Enticing to me but also very enticing to my family.": "Gerard",
  "There is no such thing as luck. It's a fancy name for being always at our duty, and so sure to be ready when good time comes.": "Edward",
  "When I get a chance to power jump off both legs, I can lean, twist, change directions and decide whether to dunk the ball or pass it to an open man. In other words, I may be committed to the air, but I still have some control over it.": "Julius",

  "The only way to break out is to gamble - take a chance with that first pick if you wanna dramatically improve your team.": "Jerry",
  "I have questioned myself about the brutality in the last few novels. Actually in 'The Leopard,' in hindsight, I feel I went a little bit too far with screaming blood. There are a couple of scenes that I regret and wish I had the chance to rewrite. 'Phantom' has less blood.": "Jo",
  "No press conference announcing a last film. I'd just steal away. Best way because, if by chance after two or three years something interesting comes up, I would not - like Sinatra - have to say: 'Well, I've thought it over and decided to come back.'": "Sophia",
  "With hindsight, we see that the Soviet Union never had a chance of world domination, but we didn't know that then.": "Ken",

  "In battle, you forgive a man anything except an unwillingness to take risks. Sometimes you have to put it on the line.": "Tom",
  "Luck always favours the brave. And you must remember that brave are the people who follow their heart brave are the people who take chances in life. Which also means you have to say no sometimes. I believe the power of no is greater than yes. ": "Preity",
  "You travel with the hope that something unexpected will happen. It has to do with enjoying being lost and figuring it out and the satisfaction. I always get a little disappointed when I know too well where I'm going, or when I've lived in a place so long that there's no chance I could possibly get lost.": "Andrew",
  "From now until the end of time no one else will ever see life with my eyes, and I mean to make the best of my chance.": "Christopher",
  "When you see the same familiar faces, it's nice when you get a chance to play with the same musicians. You start to develop this shorthand so everybody knows where you're at and where you're going, but then again, there are always surprises. But the more people are comfortable with the material, the more free you can be with the music.": "David",
  "You can't just count on becoming a syndicated cartoonist. I actually tried to calculate the odds once, and the best I could come up with is a 1-in-36,000 chance. And the odds of getting hit by lightning are 1 in 7,900 - which kind of shows how long those odds are.": "Stephan",
  "Somerset desperately needs more high-end music making on its doorstep, so the chance to share great music spanning genres as diverse as orchestral classics, trip hop and jazz, in the utterly relaxed and cathartic environment of a Somerset field, is for me the fulfilment of a long-term dream.": "Charles",

  "Medicine will be personalized and preventive: Your genome might predict that you have an 80 percent chance of breast cancer by the time you are 50, but if you take a preventive drug starting when you are 40, the chance will drop to 2 percent.": "Leroy",
  "We need to give the Iraqis a chance to build their own future. It should be in their hands. It must be in their hands. That is what democracy is all about. We can teach it, we can explain it, but they must want it enough to make it work for them.": "Barbara",
  "I love real books, paper books, but I also love buying online, and I think that people are more willing to take a chance to read something if it's cheaper - sometimes books on the Kindle are $6. A hardback book is $25. For $25, it better be a really great book. Or you're going to be mad.": "Caroline",
  "Never talk for half a minute without pausing and giving others a chance to join in.": "Sydney",
  "When I was doing poorly at school, my father yanked me out and got me a job in a shoe factory. After three weeks, I begged him to give me another chance at doing well in school. I learned that discipline is necessary to accomplish anything in life.": "Ivana",
  "If the arts are held up solely as a means of social insight, fantasy is denied the chance to be commonplace and reality the chance to be exotic.": "Richard",

  "I'm planning to be here forever, but I know at some point I'll probably have to give it up. If you live to 100, there's a very good chance you'll live forever. Because very few people die after 100.": "S.",
  "A fool must now and then be right, by chance.": "William",
  "Teachers have a chance to mold someone, inspire them. I hope all teachers realize that.": "Kevin",
  "When I left for college, I told myself that this was a chance for reinvention. No one on the other side of the country knew that I was an introvert, so maybe if I tried not acting like an introvert, I wouldn't be one.": "Andrea",

  "I signed schoolboy forms for Watford when I was 12, but then my parents got divorced, and I never kicked a ball for three years. I rebelled, I left home, but getting back into football sorted me out. It was the second chance I needed.": "Vinnie",

  "When you head on out to the Moon, in very short order, and you get a chance to look back at the Earth, that horizon slowly curves around in upon himself, and all of sudden you're looking at something that is very strange, but yet is very, very familiar, because you're beginning to see the Earth evolve.": "Eugene",
  "I'm quite old-fashioned. I like going out to dinner. You have the chance to talk to somebody and get to know them better.": "Harry",

  "In a fit at the bookstore one day, I bought all my favourite composers' biographies: Schubert, Massenet, Wolf. I've still not had a chance to read them; it breaks my heart. But when you travel so much, you just can't take that many books with you.": "Danielle",
  "I was overjoyed when I was offered the title role in 'Well Done Abba.' I was ready for the role even before I heard the story because you don't ask questions when it is Shyam Benegal's film. It is the chance of a lifetime.": "Boman",

  "I think everyone should live in New York City if they ever get the chance at least once in their life. It's such a great place to live there's a different energy about living in the city.": "Odette",
  "I sensed my chance and embraced the telecom business. I started marketing telephones, answering/fax machines under the brand name Beetel, and the company picked up really fast.": "Sunil",
  "For people who have heart disease, statins are great. But if all you've had is high cholesterol, what you're doing is taking this 1/100 chance of getting a benefit and offsetting it with 1/200 chance of getting diabetes.": "Eric",
  "I love taking chances.": "Wayne",
  "My son had his eighth birthday recently and we had a chance to borrow the film and show it to all of his friends that was at his birthday party and they loved it. I was a little nervous. I said they might not even like it, and say his daddy's movie is wack, but they loved it.": "Blair",

  "Back when I was a senior in high school in Haughton, LA, I had a chance to go to LSU. Everyone I grew up with adored LSU, including my mom. But I chose to come to Mississippi State because I wanted to start a new tradition instead of perpetuating an established one.": "Dak",

  "Musicians are always gigging and never have a chance to stop for a minute.": "Keith",
  "Who I was back then, when I started on 'One Tree Hill,' is so different from who I am now. Coming off Laguna, being 19 years old, and thrown into this odd, ridiculous spotlight, wasn't for me. There have always been haters, and people don't want to give you a chance or the benefit of the doubt, but this show gave me an opportunity.": "Stephen",
  "Don't talk to me about aesthetics or tradition. Talk to me about what sells and what's good right now. And what the American people like is to think the underdog still has a chance.": "George",

  "I just have to take my chances like any other composer.": "Gordon",
  "I play knowing that there is somebody watching me out there in the crowd that has never had the opportunity to watch a game before and it might be the only chance they ever to see one, live in person.

  "For me, growing up in Los Angeles in the '90s, Huell Howser was the most consistently watchable entertainer on TV. I was more of a radio geek as a teenager, but Huell I watched whenever I got the chance. A lot of us did.": "James",

  "I didn't see myself any different from my white counterparts in school. I just didn't! I thought I could do what they did. And what I didn't do well, I thought people were going to give me the opportunity to do well, because maybe they saw my talent, so they would give me a chance.

  "But at some point, we've got to have disciplined play and have got to coach better. I'm not putting it on the players. We've got to coach them to tackle and block better. It's as simple as that. If we can do those things, we'll have a chance.": "Steve",

  "A closing team is so important in the NBA. The last seven minutes is what you are always coaching to get to.

  "When 'The Sound of Music' aired live on NBC, 18 million people were talking about theater the next day. That's incredible. 'Grease' felt like a chance for me to participate in that landscape.": "Thomas",
  "One of the challenges of being a director is often you don't get to work with your peers.

But it's pretty rare that you get a chance to partner in that way with another director.": "Thomas",
  "My pride at being a member of the theater community is deep, and we have a chance to reach a lot of people who might feel like there's a place for them. I want theater to be part of the cultural conversation and be on par with all mediums of television in its ability to be relevant.": "Thomas",

  "The point is, when you have a chance to have a big adventure, especially if, like in your case, it doesn't hurt anyone, it's just plain foolish not to take it.": "Mink",
  "I can go to a movie theater and watch a movie I was in with an audience... but with television, the opportunity to meet the fans at Comic Con or any other situation, it's a chance to enter that circle; it's that sharing.": "Mark",
  "'The Voice' gave me a chance to show people the side of me that is an artist. People didn't know what that would look like or sound like. It allowed people to see that potential.": "Judith",

  "You know you have more to offer, and it gets frustrating when you aren't given the chance.": "Mindy",

  "Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.": "Melody",

  "Socialism has no moral justification whatsoever; poor people are not morally superior to rich people, nor are they owed anything by rich people simply because of their lack of success.

  "Socialism violates at least three of the Ten Commandments: It turns government into God, it legalizes thievery and it elevates covetousness.

  "As for reputation, though it be a glorious instrument of advancing our Master's service, yet there is a better than that: a clean heart, a single eye, and a soul full of God. A fair exchange if, by the loss of reputation, we can purchase the lowest degree of purity of heart.": "John",

  "Even Helen Keller, who was born blind and deaf, could see God.

  "When you're young, you wonder what all these old people are droning on about, trying to impart their wisdom. It's not relevant to you because being young is such a specific thing.

  "The First Amendment to the Constitution reflects that concept recognized in the Ten Commandments, that the duties we owe to God and the manner of discharging those duties are outside the purview of government.": "Roy",
  "The most important thing for me is having a relationship with God. To know that the owner, the creator of the universe loves you, sent His Son to die for your sins; that's very empowering. Knowing Him and knowing that He loves me gives me encouragement and confidence to move forward.": "Ben",
  "The style of God venerated in the church, mosque, or synagogue seems completely different from the style of the natural universe.": "Alan",

  "The end of life is to be like God, and the soul following God will be like Him.": "Socrates",
  "We cannot know the whole truth, which belongs to God alone, but our task nevertheless is to seek to know what is true. And if we offend gravely enough against what we know to be true, as by failing badly enough to deal affectionately and responsibly with our land and our neighbors, truth will retaliate with ugliness, poverty, and disease.": "Wendell",
  "What I absolutely want is to suggest that before it's anything else, redemption is God mending the bicycle of our souls; God bringing out the puncture repair kit, re-inflating the tires, taking off the rust, making us roadworthy once more. Not so that we can take flight into ecstasy, but so that we can do the next needful mile of our lives.": "Francis",
  "There cannot be a God because if there were one, I could not believe that I was not He.": "Friedrich",
  "If I truly believe everything that's in that book, God is in control. He is in control. He's working for my good. Doesn't mean everything's going to be smooth, but that's all I needed to know. There is a light at the end of the tunnel.": "Shawn",

  "Regret is not a proactive feeling. It is situated in disappointment, sorrow, even remorse. It merely wishes things were different without an act to cause a difference. However, repentance is different. Repentance is an admission of, hatred of, and turning away from sin before God.": "Monica",
  "I like smoking! I mean, God, I quit everything else, can't I smoke?": "Melanie",

  "When you focus on how wonderful God is and all the great things He's done... is doing... and even will do in your life, your natural response will be praise, adoration and awe. Don't let yourself ever get used to it... stay amazed!": "Joyce",
  "If you can believe in God, then you can believe in anything. It's a gang mentality.": "Greg",
  "I am and always will be a sinner. But that's the beautiful thing about Jesus. I'll always try to be a better person in the eyes of God. But I'm not all of a sudden stepping up on a pedestal and saying I'm holier than thou, 'cause I'm not!": "Billy",
  "After many years of great mercy, after tasting of the powers of the world to come, we still are so weak, so foolish; but, oh! when we get away from self to God, there all is truth and purity and holiness, and our heart finds peace, wisdom, completeness, delight, joy, victory.": "Charles",

  "If there is no God, everything is permitted.": "Fyodor",

  "A 'real pastor' is not preaching of their own; they are speaking what God put in their heart by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit is using them at that very moment to speak to the congregations situations -past, present, and future.": "Monica",
  "The fact that what we believe about marriage - that it should be between a man and a woman - and that we're pro-life, somehow that becomes radical? Why is that? It's because our culture has changed. But the truth is, culture may change, people change, but the Word of God never changes, and that's what we rest our belief system on.": "Robert",

  "Every perfect life is a parable invented by God.": "Simone",
  "My name is Linus, and I am your God.": "Linus",

  "As you walk in God's divine wisdom, you will surely begin to see a greater measure of victory and good success in your life.": "Joseph",
  "The God of the Hebrews is a God that human language, we're not even supposed to speak the holy name. We were told in the Second Commandment we could make no images of this God, and I don't think that means just building idols, I think that means also trying to believe you've captured God in your words, in the Creeds, in the Scriptures.": "John",
  "In the Lord's Prayer, the first petition is for daily bread. No one can worship God or love his neighbor on an empty stomach.": "Woodrow",
  "Sorrow for sin is indeed necessary, but it should not be an endless preoccupation. You must dwell also on the glad remembrance of God's loving-kindness; otherwise, sadness will harden the heart and lead it more deeply into despair.": "Saint",
  "Because I believe in God and have faith in God, it doesn't mean I am immortal. It doesn't mean I am immune, as has been claimed. I am as scared as anyone of getting hurt, especially driving a Formula One car.": "Ayrton",

  "I'm an atheist and I thank God for it.": "George",

  "To doubt God is to doubt one's own conscience, and in consequence, it would be to doubt everything; and then what is life for?": "Jose",

  "The key to winning is choosing to do God's will and loving others with all you've got.": "Lou",
  "Here's the reality. The image of a white Jesus has been used to justify enslavement, conquest, colonialism, the genocide of indigenous peoples. There are literally millions of human beings whose lives have been snuffed out by people who conquered under the banner of a white god.": "Tim",
  "Sense perceptions can be and often are false and deceptive, however real they may appear to us. Where there is realization outside the senses, it is infallible.

  "People who cease to believe in God or goodness altogether still believe in the devil. I don't know why. No, I do indeed know why. Evil is always possible. And goodness is eternally difficult.": "Anne",

  "The only answer to fear is faith in God, knowing He loves you unconditionally and individually.": "Joyce",

  "My mother always used to say, 'Well, if you had been born a little girl growing up in Egypt, you would go to church or go to worship Allah, but surely if those people are worshipping a God, it must be the same God' - that's what she always said. The same God with different names.": "Jane",

  "There are worlds and more worlds below them, and there are a hundred thousand skies over them. No one has been able to find the limits and boundaries of God. If there be any account of God, then alone the mortal can write the same; but God's account does not finish, and the mortal himself dies while still writing.": "Guru",
  "I wish that the Indians believed me a god, for upon the report of an enemy's valor oftentimes depends the success of a battle, and false reports have many times done as great things as true courage and resolution.": "Alexander",

  "Every creature is a word of God.": "Meister",
  "The grace of God is dangerous. It's lavish, excessive, outrageous, and scandalous. God's grace is ridiculously inclusive. Apparently God doesn't care who He loves. He is not very careful about the people He calls His friends or the people He calls His Church.": "Mike",

  "Ascetics and fakirs come to mitigate human suffering to heal us and lead us on the path. They put up with criticism they go through many worldly trials. Some of them have even become martyrs for our sake. But they have done all this with a smile and with gratitude to God. Hence sacrifice is a great virtue.": "Sadhu",

  "All God wants of man is a peaceful heart.": "Meister",
  "As much as I loved the model of St. Francis, I realized that I couldn't afford to be poor, because unlike St. Francis, I'm not celibate.

  "There's always an element of self delusion among people who believe they ought to be President. There's an underestimation of your opponent and an overestimation of your own abilities. This is compatible with being rich and powerful, the idea that we were blessed by God because we deserve to be blessed.": "Jimmy",
  "For me, Batman is the one that can most clearly be taken seriously. He's not from another planet, or filled with radioactive gunk. I mean, Superman is essentially a god, but Batman is more like Hercules: he's a human being, very flawed, and bridges the divide.": "Christopher",

  "God's most lordly gift to man is decency of mind.": "Aeschylus",
  "One of the peculiar sins of the twentieth century which we've developed to a very high level is the sin of credulity. It has been said that when human beings stop believing in God they believe in nothing. The truth is much worse: they believe in anything.": "Malcolm",

  "The fundamental idea which defines a human being as a Muslim is the declaration of faith: that there is a creator, whom we call God - or Allah, in Arabic - and that the creator is one and single.

  "Scientific knowledge is in perpetual evolution it finds itself changed from one day to the next.": "Jean",
  "To say, 'well done' to any bit of good work is to take hold of the powers which have made the effort and strengthen them beyond our knowledge.": "Phillips",

  "Pleasures take to themselves wings and fly away true knowledge remains forever.": "Dorothea",
  "In truth, opinion may be taken for understanding; understanding cannot be taken for opinion. How so? Surely because opinion may be deceived; understanding cannot be. If it could, it would not be understanding but opinion. For true understanding has not only certain truth, but the knowledge of truth.": "Saint",

  "Dogmatism and skepticism are both, in a sense, absolute philosophies; one is certain of knowing, the other of not knowing. What philosophy should dissipate is certainty, whether of knowledge or ignorance.": "Bertrand",
  "You move forward through knowledge. You prevail through knowledge. I love the word 'prevail.' Prevail!": "James",
  "For me, human rights simply endorse a view of life and a set of moral values that are perfectly clear to an eight-year-old child. A child knows what is fair and isn't fair, and justice derives from that knowledge.": "Tom",
  "I am a lover of truth; and if you think of truth as being multifaceted and so huge that we human beings can't fully comprehend it, then obviously it makes sense to put all the facts together - to compare disciplines and try to advance the sum of knowledge by exploration and examination.": "Susan",

  "The secret of improved plant breeding, apart from scientific knowledge, is love.": "Luther",
  "It's a bit cliche, but you can't go wrong by writing what you know. Even if you're a horrible writer, your own knowledge and experience is unrivaled. Nobody knows what you know like you know what you know. The way you see things is pretty unique.": "Issa",
  "Just as we might take Darwin as an example of the normal extraverted thinking type, the normal introverted thinking type could be represented by Kant. The one speaks with facts, the other relies on the subjective factor. Darwin ranges over the wide field of objective reality, Kant restricts himself to a critique of knowledge.": "Carl",

  "We are sinful not only because we have eaten of the Tree of Knowledge, but also because we have not yet eaten of the Tree of Life. The state in which we are is sinful, irrespective of guilt.": "Franz",
  "You always get things that teach you and steps to grow, but there is a confidence that is gained and a deep understanding of what it means to be supported by your knowledge - not by some team that is there to create confidence; it is there within you. That takes time. That takes teachers. That takes taking risks.": "Sharon",
  "I live in a country where music has very little success, though, exclusive of those who have forsaken us, we have still admirable professors and, more particularly, composers of great solidity, knowledge, and taste.": "Wolfgang",

  "The aim of education is the knowledge not of facts but of values.": "William",
  "As the biggest library if it is in disorder is not as useful as a small but well-arranged one, so you may accumulate a vast amount of knowledge but it will be of far less value than a much smaller amount if you have not thought it over for yourself.": "Arthur",
  "The degree of one's emotions varies inversely with one's knowledge of the facts.": "Bertrand",
  "When you know a thing, to hold that you know it, and when you do not know a thing, to allow that you do not know it - this is knowledge.": "Confucius",

  "The only fence against the world is a thorough knowledge of it.": "John",
  "The fact that television and tourism have made the whole world accessible has created the illusion that we enjoy intimate knowledge of other places, when we barely scratch their surface. For the vast majority, the knowledge of Thailand or Sri Lanka acquired through tourism consists of little more than the whereabouts of the beach.": "Martin",
  "If we wish to discuss knowledge in the most highly developed contemporary society, we must answer the preliminary question of what methodological representation to apply to that society.": "Jean-Francois",

  "The SAT is not perfect. We all know smart, knowledgeable people who do badly on standardized tests. But neither is it useless. SAT scores do measure both specific knowledge and valuable thinking skills.": "Virginia",
  "The price one pays for pursuing any profession, or calling, is an intimate knowledge of its ugly side.": "James",
  "Knowledge is an unending adventure at the edge of uncertainty.": "Jacob",

  "Nothing leads so straight to futility as literary ambitions without systematic knowledge.": "H.",

You cannot build a healthy society without giving your citizens a sense of ownership. Otherwise, they will not share with you the responsibilities.": "Moza",
  "Religious speech is extreme, emotional, and motivational. It is anti-literal, relying on metaphor, allusion, and other rhetorical devices, and it assumes knowledge within a community of believers.": "Amy",
  "Psychopaths know the technical difference between right and wrong - which is one of the reasons their insanity pleas in criminal cases so rarely succeed they just fail to act on that knowledge. ": "Jeffrey",
  "Widespread public access to knowledge, like public education, is one of the pillars of our democracy, a guarantee that we can maintain a well-informed citizenry.": "Scott",
  "This is part of the involuntary bargain we make with the world just by being alive.

  "Of the five most important things in life, health is first, education or knowledge is second, and wealth is third. I forget the other two.": "Chuck",

  "The secret to being successful from a trading perspective is to have an indefatigable and an undying and unquenchable thirst for information and knowledge.": "Paul",
  "I like intensity. If it's too mellow, I feel like, bleah. I like intensity, because it's way of reaching spaces inside of you, and it's my need of knowledge, of knowing about myself regardless.": "Juliette",
  "Give, give, give - what is the point of having experience, knowledge or talent if I don't give it away? Of having stories if I don't tell them to others? Of having wealth if I don't share it? I don't intend to be cremated with any of it! It is in giving that I connect with others, with the world and with the divine.": "Isabel",

  "The search for knowledge is a long and difficult task.": "Fabiola",
  "I think that we have a great opportunity to impart our wisdom and our knowledge and our experience to this younger generation. It may be different times, but experience transcends time, and wisdom transcends time.": "Victoria",

  "It's tough being a dictator, but I've always thought it must be tougher being a hanger-on to a dictator. The late nights spent listening to his crazed ranting, the weary rictus grin from smiling at bad jokes, the draining knowledge that one misjudged comment could land you on the chopping block.": "John",
  "At the simplest level, economics can better show us the consequences of our actions. Less simple are cases in which we don't have the knowledge to predict the full consequences. Global warming and climate change are examples.": "Edmund",

  "While my parents never had the time or money to secure university education themselves, they were adamant that their children should.

  "If age someday grounds my feet and wilts my port de bras, what vestige of the old life will be left? The signs that I was a dancer will gradually fade like stripes on a beach towel. Even my knowledge of the art form, reaped in sweat over decades, could be lost over time.": "Sascha",

  "When it comes to power, God Himself is the power. God often uses foolish things to confound the wise. That is why people like me will ever be grateful to God. In terms of knowledge, education and name, I am nowhere - a neglected stone.": "T.",
  "Human knowledge is never contained in one person. It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still, it is never complete.": "Paul",

  "The truth is often terrifying, which I think is one of the motifs of Larry and Andrew's cinema. The cost of knowledge is an important theme. In the second and third films, they explore the consequences of Neo's choice to know the truth. It's a beautiful, beautiful story.": "Keanu",

  "If a little knowledge was a dangerous thing, a lot was lethal.": "Tom",
  "I didn't have any knowledge of the music industry when I first got to L.A., and I really didn't know on a creative level what I wanted to sound like, so I had to do a lot of experimenting. It led to a spiral of depression and being broke.": "Skylar",
  "I would designate as science fiction in the best sense: they are visions and anticipations by which we seek to attain a true knowledge, but, in fact, they are only imaginations whereby we seek to draw near to the reality.": "Pope",

  "All knowledge or form conception is evoked through the medium of the eye, either in response to disturbances directly received on the retina or to their fainter secondary effects and reverberations. Other sense organs can only call forth feelings which have no reality of existence and of which no conception can be formed.": "Nikola",

  "If in preaching the gospel you substitute your knowledge of the way of salvation for confidence in the power of the gospel, you hinder people from getting to reality.": "Oswald",

  "Over the past years, I have lectured many times on the Cuban missile crisis, most provocatively to 200 senior officers of the former Soviet army in Moscow in 1991, among them KGB generals. There, my knowledge of Penkovsky's role was thoroughly confirmed, and so was the Soviet military men's residual sense of humiliation at Khrushchev's 'blink'.": "Alistair",

  "We use paper documents to store knowledge so we can consult and reconsult it, giving us a type of recall impossible with our unaided minds; we use pencils to scratch down material so we can manipulate it in a fashion impossible in our unaided minds.": "Clive",
  "In law, as in every other branch of knowledge, the truths given by induction tend to form the premises for new deductions. The lawyers and the judges of successive generations do not repeat for themselves the process of verification any more than most of us repeat the demonstrations of the truths of astronomy or physics.": "Benjamin",

  "Elon Musk wins you over with his elegant mastery of engineering, be it for the rocket or the car. But what blew my socks off was when our conversation veered way off topic. We started musing about whether it was possible we all lived in the matrix, and Musk still had deep knowledge.": "Steve",
  "The passionate controversies of one era are viewed as sterile preoccupations by another, for knowledge alters what we seek as well as what we find.": "Freda",
  "Solitude can be used well by very few people. They who do must have a knowledge of the world to see the foolishness of it, and enough virtue to despise all the vanity.": "Abraham",
  "In rating ease of description as very important, we are essentially asserting a belief in quantitative knowledge - a belief that most of the key questions in our world sooner or later demand answers to 'by how much?' rather than merely to 'in which direction?'": "John",
  "A man can only attain knowledge with the help of those who possess it. This must be understood from the very beginning. One must learn from him who knows.": "George",

  "Those Dutchmen had hardly any imagination or fantasy, but their good taste and their scientific knowledge of composition were enormous.": "Vincent",
  "What does mysticism really mean? It means the way to attain knowledge. It's close to philosophy, except in philosophy you go horizontally while in mysticism you go vertically.": "Elie",
  "The improver of natural knowledge absolutely refuses to acknowledge authority, as such. For him, skepticism is the highest of duties; blind faith the one unpardonable sin.": "Thomas",
  "Mistakes are, after all, the foundations of truth, and if a man does not know what a thing is, it is at least an increase in knowledge if he knows what it is not.": "Carl",
  "Very few beings really seek knowledge in this world. Mortal or immortal, few really ASK. On the contrary, they try to wring from the unknown the answers they have already shaped in their own minds.": "Anne",

  "Debating clubs among boys are very useful, not only as affording pleasant meetings and interesting discussions, but also as serving for training grounds for developing the knowledge and the qualities that are needed in public life.": "Annie",
  "We learn much during our sleep, and the knowledge thus gained slowly filters into the physical brain, and is occasionally impressed upon it as a vivid and illuminative dream.": "Annie",
  "Schools still operate as if all knowledge is contained in books, and as if the salient points in books must be stored in each human brain - to be used when needed. The political and financial powers controlling schools decide what these salient points are.": "Sugata",

  "I'm always pursuing knowledge I'm a seeker of spiritual equilibrium - and music is a big part of that.": "Steve",

  "To attain any assured knowledge about the soul is one of the most difficult things in the world.": "Aristotle",
  "Browsing for books with a mouse and screen is not nearly as joyful an act as wandering the stacks and getting lost in the labyrinthine corridors of knowledge. The best libraries are places of imagination, education and community. The best libraries have mystery to them.": "Sam",
  "The perfect knowledge of events cannot be acquired without divine inspiration, since all prophetic inspiration receives its prime motivating force from God the creator, then from good fortune and nature.": "Nostradamus",

  "The liberal professions, and in a wider sense the well-to-do classes, are certainly those with the liveliest taste for knowledge and the most active intellectual life.": "Emile",
  "The research I have been doing - studying how foodstuffs yield energy in living cells - does not lead to the kind of knowledge that can be expected to give immediate practical benefits to mankind.

  "Seldom ever was any knowledge given to keep, but to impart; the grace of this rich jewel is lost in concealment.": "Wendell",
  "The greatest gift is a passion for reading. It is cheap, it consoles, it distracts, it excites, it gives you knowledge of the world and experience of a wide kind. It is a moral illumination.": "Elizabeth",
  "The best theology is rather a divine life than a divine knowledge.": "Jeremy",
  "Every man gets a narrower and narrower field of knowledge in which he must be an expert in order to compete with other people. The specialist knows more and more about less and less and finally knows everything about nothing.": "Konrad",

  "There is no knowledge, no light, no wisdom that you are in possession of, but what you have received it from some source.": "Brigham",

  "Without a knowledge of mythology much of the elegant literature of our own language cannot be understood and appreciated.": "Thomas",
  "Even scientific knowledge, if there is anything to it, is not a random observation of random objects; for the critical objectivity of significant knowledge is attained as a practice only philosophically in inner action.": "Karl",
  "A knowledge of the forces that rule society, of the causes that have produced its upheavals, and of society's resources for promoting healthy progress has become of vital concern to our civilization.": "Wilhelm",
  "It is true that the aristocracies seem to have abused their monopoly of legal knowledge and at all events their exclusive possession of the law was a formidable impediment to the success of those popular movements which began to be universal in the western world.": "Henry",
  "I thought they may have presumed too much knowledge of certain things for people who are not comedians. Like Montreal. A comic understands what it is and its importance, but someone else may not know about it.": "Todd",

  "Can the knowledge deriving from reason even begin to compare with knowledge perceptible by sense?": "Louis",
  "How pathetically scanty my self-knowledge is compared with, say, my knowledge of my room. There is no such thing as observation of the inner world, as there is of the outer world.": "Franz",
  "These past years, as we have been recovering and given our city a rebirth, we have been encouraged by our faith, knowledge, and steadfast belief that we will pull through. There will be challenges and setbacks, as there have already been, but we will continue, and we the citizens of New Orleans will prevail in bringing our city back.": "Cedric",
  "I think a lot of people, even Christians, are willing to be satisfied with gaining lots and lots of biblical knowledge - and many people go to Bible studies and don't realize it isn't enough to know what's right, it's applying the information and the knowledge that you have.": "Charles",
  "The library is seen as a force for self improvement and the pursuit of knowledge. I fear that in many cases this is no longer true, if it ever was.": "John",
  "Today mythical thinking has fallen into disrepute we often dismiss it as irrational and self-indulgent. But the imagination is also the faculty that has enabled scientists to bring new knowledge to light and to invent technology that has made us immeasurably more effective.": "Karen",
  "If you go and talk to most people, they mean well but they don't have much of a breadth on education, of knowledge of understanding what the real issues are and therefore they listen to pundits on television who tell them what they are supposed to think and they keep repeating that until pretty soon they say, 'Oh, well that must be true.'": "Ben",
  "When I wrote 'The Alexandria Link,' I discovered that we are only aware of about 10 percent of the knowledge of the ancient world. In the ancient world, most of the knowledge was destroyed. Every emperor of China who came in wiped out everything that came before them, to the point that the country completely forgot its past.": "Steve",
  "I want to be safe in the knowledge that I can tour and play festivals for a long time. The main thing is that I want a good reputation as a live performer. If I have that, I'd be so happy.": "Ellie",
  "Even though I'm a hype man myself, I like the practicality of it all. People who understand how to turn a profit. At the end of the day, this is still business so I'm looking for real practical knowledge of how to actually make money, not necessarily raise it.": "Gary",
  "The people I go after are the false experts, those who do not accept the limits of their knowledge.": "Nassim",
  "I'm not saying that atheists can't act morally or have moral knowledge. But when I ascribe virtue to an atheist, it's as a theist who sees the atheist as conforming to objective moral values. The atheist, by contrast, has no such basis for morality. And yet all moral judgments require a basis for morality, some standard of right and wrong.": "William",
  "Liberated from the error of pagan tradition through the benevolence and loving kindness of the good God with the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the operation of the Holy Spirit, I was reared from the very beginning by Christian parents. From them I learned even in babyhood the Holy Scriptures which led me to a knowledge of the truth.": "Saint",
  "For, verily, great love springs from great knowledge of the beloved object, and if you little know it, you will be able to love it only little or not at all.": "Leonardo",
  "I'm a strict, strict agnostic. It's very different from a casual, 'I don't know.' It's that you cannot present as knowledge something that is not knowledge. You can present it as faith, you can present it as belief, but you can't present it as fact.": "Margaret",
  "The pilgrims on the Mayflower landed at Plymouth Rock. To my knowledge, they didn't wait around for a return trip to Europe. You settle some place with a purpose. If you don't want to do that, stay home. You avoid an awful lot of risks by not venturing outward.": "Buzz",
  "In chess, knowledge is a very transient thing. It changes so fast that even a single mouse-slip sometimes changes the evaluation.": "Viswanathan",

  "For those who have obtained unobstructed knowledge of Self, the world is seen merely as a bondage causing imagination.": "Ramana",
  "It's my job to know what's available from every retailer, catalog, website, antiques mall, and craftsperson. A good designer or decorator has to have an almost encyclopedic knowledge.": "Nate",

  "Let me put it this way: There is nothing in Islam that is fundamentally against the quest for knowledge.": "Ahmed",
  "I do not mean to say that we should, or could, return to traditional nomadic economies. I do mean to say that there are systems of knowledge and grand poetical schemata derived from the mobile life that it would be foolish to disregard or underrate. And mad to destroy.": "Robyn",

Our mission is to connect the appropriate persons, knowledge, and resources at the appropriate time and location to achieve the optimal health outcome.": "Neal",
  "It's not the music you hear in your head that other people are going to hear. You have to be able to make it true enough to the image in your head, and that's where technique and technology come in, for sure, and knowledge. It's not true and will never be true that someone who knows nothing can sit in a basement and make great music.": "Neil",
  "One thing I found very interesting about comedians around the world was their knowledge of stuff outside of their own culture and comfort zone. That's not very common in the States. We produce our own soft power, which is pop culture, but we rarely try to absorb and learn information from other cultures and countries.": "Hasan",
  "I felt deep within me that the highest point a man can attain is not Knowledge or Virtue or Goodness or Victory but something even greater, more heroic and more despairing: Sacred Awe!": "Nikos",

  "Devotion complete culminates in knowledge supreme.": "Ramana",
  "What patients seek is not scientific knowledge that doctors hide, but existential authenticity each person must find on her own... the angst of facing mortality has no remedy in probability.": "Paul",

  "Research is creation of knowledge which leads to new and efficient solutions for the society. Shiv Nadar University, therefore, believes in being at the forefront of research. To create new knowledge, one needs to solve open-ended problems, which basically make one think on one's own.": "Shiv",

  "The age we live in is a busy age in which knowledge is rapidly advancing towards perfection.": "Jeremy",
  "The science of politics is the one science that is deposited by the streams of history, like the grains of gold in the sand of a river; and the knowledge of the past, the record of truths revealed by experience, is eminently practical, as an instrument of action and a power that goes to making the future.": "Lord",
  "I think in the NFL knowledge is power, and you try to get the knowledge by whatever means.": "Steve",
  "Most North Americans know that human-caused global warming is real, even if political leaders don't always reflect or act on that knowledge.": "David",
  "Elections, for their part, are typically popularity contests rather than measures of candidates' relative competency or effectiveness. Imagine if scientific truth were determined according to which scientist was most popular. To be successful, scientists would have to be charismatic and attractive - and human knowledge would suffer terribly.": "Nathan",
  "Concentration of the mind is in a way common to both Knowledge and Yoga. Yoga aims at union of the individual with the universal, the Reality. This Reality cannot be new. It must exist even now, and it does exist.": "Ramana",

  "What the Kinseyites and I had in common so long ago was the knowledge that homosexual and heterosexual behavior are natural to all mammals, and that what differs from individual to individual is the balance between these two complementary but not necessarily conflicted drives.": "Gore",
  "Science is based on reproducibility and manufactured objectivity. As strong as that makes its ability to generate claims about matter and energy, it also makes scientific knowledge inapplicable to the existential, visceral nature of human life, which is unique and subjective and unpredictable.": "Paul",
  "To be conscious that you are ignorant of the facts is a great step to knowledge.": "Benjamin",
  "Knowledge is knowing that we cannot know.": "Ralph",
  "For a highly motivated learner, it's not like knowledge is secret and somehow the Internet made it not secret. It just made knowledge easy to find. If you're a motivated enough learner, books are pretty good.": "Bill",

  "Counterintuitive actions prove we can trust real knowledge and do the opposite of what we feel makes sense.": "Penn",
  "Looking back, I realise it wasn't only gym I dreaded at school. Every class was a torment. It wasn't knowledge I objected to but instruction. Why couldn't they just tell us what books to read and leave us to get on and read them?": "Howard",
  "One of the interesting things about having little musical knowledge is that you generate surprising results sometimes you move to places you wouldn't if you knew better.": "Brian",
  "Academics lack perspective. In a debate on whether the world is round, they would argue, 'No,' because it's an oblate spheroid. They suffer from 'the curse of knowledge': the inability to imagine what it's like not to know something that they know.": "Steven",
  "Though knowledge itself increasingly ignores boundaries between fields, professors are apt to organize their pedagogy around the methods and history of their academic subculture rather than some coherent topic in the world.": "Steven",
  "Economics has many substantive areas of knowledge where there is agreement, but also contains areas of controversy. That's inescapable.": "Ben",
  "Wisdom is knowledge which has become a part of one's being.": "Orison",
  "If I was left to my own devices, you would see about ten T-shirts in rotation with maybe a few nice pairs of jeans - but I also like to look good. I like feeling really well put together, I just don't have the aptitude and the knowledge to do that.": "Daniel",
  "All knowledge which ends in words will die as quickly as it came to life, with the exception of the written word: which is its mechanical part.": "Leonardo",
  "My father values talent. He recognizes real knowledge and skill when he finds it. He is color blind and gender neutral. He hires the best person for the job, period.": "Ivanka",
  "Since the Renaissance, a concept called 'progress' has been baked into our society. Progress - founded on an accumulation of knowledge through experience (and in the case of science, through experiment). To build on the past rather than endlessly relive it. That's what separates us from the beasts.": "Seth",
  "The ideas of science germinate in a matrix of established knowledge gained by experiment; they are not lonesome thoughts, born in a rarified realm where no researcher has ever gone before.": "Seth",
  "To my knowledge, I was the first guy really to do what I do. And then later on different comedians started trying doing it.": "Don",
  "As education becomes dematerialized, demonetized and democratized, every man, woman and child on the planet will be able to reap the benefits of knowledge. We're rapidly heading toward a world of education abundance.": "Peter",
  "Knowledge about the economy, ideas about capitalism and government, the future of the world and geopolitics were things I was never really interested in.": "Shia",

  "Faith: Belief without evidence in what is told by one who speaks without knowledge, of things without parallel.": "Ambrose",
  "You will always have partial points of view, and you'll always have the story behind the story that hasn't come out yet. And any form of journalism you're involved with is going to be up against a biased viewpoint and partial knowledge.": "Margaret",
  "I believe indeterminate sentencing can be extremely useful, but I also believe that any such system should always take into consideration the special knowledge as to the facts in a case which only the trial judge possesses.": "Robert",
  "Summer is not obligatory. We can start an infernally hard jigsaw puzzle in June with the knowledge that, if there are enough rainy days, we may just finish it by Labor Day, but if not, there's no harm, no penalty. We may have better things to do.": "Nancy",
  "Decision making in a democracy depends above all on knowledge and not just the intel available to presidents and policymakers.": "Nancy",
  "We all need each other in publishing to make publishing work for authors in a variety of formats now and in the future. Anyone who thinks publishers don't bring anything to the table has a very narrow view and lack of knowledge about the industry as a whole.": "Robert",
  "Prices are important not because money is considered paramount but because prices are a fast and effective conveyor of information through a vast society in which fragmented knowledge must be coordinated.": "Thomas",
  "I believe in this being, not because I have any proper or direct knowledge of His existence, but I am at a loss to account for the existence and arrangement of the visible universe, and, being left in the wide sea of conjecture without a clue from analogy or experience, I find the conjecture of a God easy, obvious, and irresistible.": "William",
  "Surprise drives progress because innovation depends on the sort of knowledge no one can gather in a central place.": "Virginia",
  "On the simplest level, telecommuting makes it harder for people to have the kinds of informal interactions that are crucial to the way knowledge moves through an organization. The role that hallway chat plays in driving new ideas has become a cliche of business writing, but that doesn't make it less true.": "James",
  "The seat of knowledge is in the head; of wisdom, in the heart. We are sure to judge wrong, if we do not feel right.": "William",
  "Productivity depends on many factors, including our workforce's knowledge and skills and the quantity and quality of the capital, technology, and infrastructure that they have to work with.": "Janet",
  "Knowledge is not eating, and we cannot expect to devour and possess what we mean. Knowledge is recognition of something absent; it is a salutation, not an embrace.": "George",
  "We can be knowledgable with other men's knowledge but we cannot be wise with other men's wisdom.": "Michel",
  "The digital revolution has also meant a revolution in access to information. This puts more power and knowledge into the hands of nonexperts.": "Naveen",
  "Knowledge without education is but armed injustice.": "Horace",
  "Esoteric or inner knowledge is no different from other kinds of human knowledge and ability. It is a mystery for the average person only to the extent that writing is a mystery for those who have not yet learned to write.": "Rudolf",
  "When Kennedy could not get the civil rights bill passed - and he was the big liberal - Lyndon Johnson came in and it got passed, and he was the conservative and the southerner. So sometimes in politics, to get something done, it takes a special kind of knowledge and a special kind of person, but it doesn't always follow the party lines.": "Jim",
  "Atheists have to live with the knowledge that there is no salvation, no redemption, no second chances. Lives can go terribly wrong in ways that can never be put right.": "Julian",

  "I read many things. I read to fill in my knowledge of the world.": "V.",
  "No one would argue that it's in the United States' interest to have independent knowledge of the plans and intentions of foreign countries. But we need to think about where to draw the line on these kind of operations so we're not always attacking our allies, the people we trust, the people we need to rely on, and to have them in turn rely on us.": "Edward",
  "To the best of my knowledge, none of the Beatles can read music.": "George",
  "The knowledge and spiritual conviction we receive from the Holy Ghost are the result of revelation.": "David",
  "How can smart women be so stupid about men sometimes? Lack of knowledge. It's what men have kept secret for so long.": "Steve",
  "I not only wanted to showcase lyrical skills but also continue to drop knowledge on the hiphop community. I'm looking to elevate through my music, and through my music I educate.": "Talib",
  "I'm on a mission. And I know the older I get, I may lose a step or two, but it's all up in the medulla oblongata. I've got a lot up there. I've got a lot of knowledge... in this medulla oblongata.": "Shaquille",
  "To say a scientist is not at all responsible is wrong. But to say that someone who invents a piece of knowledge or technology is responsible for all future uses is ridiculous. It doesn't have to be that binary.": "Astro",
  "I have appeared on 'The Dr. Oz show' and recognize that Dr. Oz does not hold the exact same viewpoints about all controversies in human nutrition that I do, but he has a huge base of knowledge and is open-minded and willing to re-consider a position based on emerging evidence on multiple scientific and health issues.": "Joel",
  "Your knowledge of what is going on can only be superficial and relative.": "William",
  "No body of knowledge needs an organizational policy. Organizational policy can only impede the advancement of knowledge. There is a basic incompatibility between any organization and freedom of thought.": "William",

  "Even knowledge has to be in the fashion, and where it is not, it is wise to affect ignorance.": "Baltasar",
  "We never stop to consider that our beliefs are only a relative truth that's always going to be distorted by all the knowledge we have stored in our memory.": "Don",
  "We live in an age of instant knowledge. And there's almost a sense of entitlement to that.": "J.",
  "Exclusively of the abstract sciences, the largest and worthiest portion of our knowledge consists of aphorisms: and the greatest and best of men is but an aphorism.": "Samuel",
  "Knowledge has always flowed upwards to bishops and kings, not down to serfs and slaves.": "Julian",
  "I think it's difficult for young people to acknowledge being smart, to knowledge being a reader. I see kids who are embarrassed to read books. They're embarrassed to have people see them doing it.": "Walter",
  "I'm very lucky; I have a lot of knowledge. My favorite band is The Beatles, so a lot of inspiration for my music comes from them, too.": "Sabrina",
  "There are a lot of things that people go through, and maybe they don't know how to get through it, and maybe you do, and if you have some sort of knowledge or power, share with the world.": "Sabrina",
  "Epistemology is the study of knowledge. By what conduit do we know what we know?": "Theodore",

  "One must know combinations, one must have a true knowledge of food to be in the moment.": "Charlie",
  "A jazz musician can improvise based on his knowledge of music. He understands how things go together. For a chef, once you have that basis, that's when cuisine is truly exciting.": "Charlie",
  "The mentor-mentee relationship is ideally like that of the guru and disciple: motivated by the desire of the guru to impart knowledge to the disciple.": "Vivek",
  "As citizens of a free society, we have a duty to look critically at our world. But if we think we know what is wrong, we must act upon that knowledge.": "Tony",
  "The mind itself is of the form of all, i.e., of soul, God and world; when it becomes of the form of the Self through knowledge, there is release, which is of the nature of Brahman: this is the teaching.": "Ramana",
  "Knowledge is the life of the mind.": "Abu",
  "Someday in the distant cyborg future, when our internal and external memories fully merge, we may come to possess infinite knowledge. But that's not the same thing as wisdom.": "Joshua",
  "My musical knowledge is so bad it's embarrassing. When composers discuss music with someone as primitive as myself, they have to talk about it in terms of senses and emotion, rather than keys and tempo.": "Jane",
  "What I count as real prosperity... is the growth in a knowledge of God, and in a testimony, and in the power to live the gospel and to inspire our families to do the same. That is prosperity of the truest kind.": "Heber",
  "An entrepreneur needs to know what they need, period. Then they need to find an investor who can build off whatever their weaknesses are - whether that's through money, strategic partnerships or knowledge.": "Daymond",
  "Wild Bill was anything but a quarrelsome man yet I have personal knowledge of at least half a dozen men whom he had at various times killed.": "Buffalo",

  "Security... it's simply the recognition that changes will take place and the knowledge that you're willing to deal with whatever happens.": "Harry",
  "The point of college is more to acquire skills than to acquire domain knowledge. One of the skills that is going to be most necessary: you have to be able to read with rigor and write with clarity. You have to be able to communicate. To make an argument, whether it's in a written piece or in front of a group of people.": "Dan",
  "The impact of giving someone a connected smartphone is no different from giving them a real computer. I look at how my kids learn and how different it is from how I learned because the impact of these things is just so huge. Sometimes I think we don't fully internalize what it is to get the power of knowledge in everyone's hand.": "Sundar",
  "What are the relationships between power and knowledge? There are two bad, short answers: 1. Knowledge provides an instrument that those in power can wield for their own ends. 2. A new body of knowledge brings into being a new class of people or institutions that can exercise a new kind of power.": "Ian",
  "His ignorance was as remarkable as his knowledge.": "Arthur",
  "A quest for knowledge is not a war with faith; spirituality is not usually an infelicitous amalgam of superstition and philistinism; and moral relativism, taken outside midfield, leads inexorably both to heresy and to secular wickedness, which are often identical.": "Conrad",
  "Many people make the mistake of confusing information with knowledge. They are not the same thing. Knowledge involves the interpretation of information. Knowledge involves listening.": "Henning",
  "Never stop learning knowledge doubles every fourteen months.": "Anthony",
  "In general, the public knowledge base and thus decision-making behaviors are far more influenced by advertisement than with current science.": "David",
  "You should be a person inside the world with knowledge of your terrain. And if you lock yourself into the 2,000-by-3,000-square-mile, lower-48 box of the United States, you're going to be frustrated by its limitations. You gotta think outside the box.": "Chuck",

  "The primary goal of management education was, as originally conceived, to impart knowledge that could be applied to a variety of real-world business situations.": "Warren",
  "I would call myself a Gnostic. Which means, I'm interested in pursuing and understanding the spiritual nature of things. A Gnostic is somebody seeking knowledge of that aspect of reality.": "Robert",
  "Aversion toward the blind exists for the same reason that most prejudices exist: lack of knowledge. Ignorance is a powerful generator of fear. And fear slides easily into aggression and contempt.": "Rosemary",
  "Hope is the belief we might get it done, and faith is the knowledge we will get it done.": "Tom",
  "We foresee no limit to scientific advancement in the future, and in scientific truth there is nothing dead; science is always a living and growing body of knowledge; but art on the contrary has many times run its course to an end, and exhausted its vital power.": "George",

  "My fundamental philosophy is that you owe it to society to transfer to them any knowledge you have that might be useful.": "Leroy",
  "Some say that sudden knowledge of mystical matters is accomplished only in complete quietude, or that Creator, in one of God's many forms, appears only in orderly ways that are beauteous and picturesque, or that the mystical appears only in completely silent ways.

  "I have learned throughout my life as a composer chiefly through my mistakes and pursuits of false assumptions, not by my exposure to founts of wisdom and knowledge.": "Igor",
  "There's a lot of information that has been in peoples' heads and hasn't gotten onto the Internet. Even as the Web has gotten really big, there's just been this gap. So we made Quora as a general place for people to share knowledge of all kinds.": "Adam",
  "I'm always trying to find brain food and indulge in knowledge that's gonna be useful.": "Big",
  "I was a huge Muppet fan growing up, but that was the extent of my puppet knowledge. I really loved the art form and the whole Henson universe.": "Rob",
  "It used to bug me that I couldn't even afford to take my family for a proper holiday. I didn't have any professional knowledge, and getting a photographer's job in a magazine was out of the question. So, armed with a Pentax K1000, I started going to various maidans of Mumbai, looking for subjects.": "Boman",
  "I am afraid of aeroplanes. I've been able to avoid flying for some time, but I suppose, if I had to, I would. Perhaps it's a case of a little knowledge being a dangerous thing. At one time, I had a pilot's licence and 160 hours of solo time on single-engine light aircraft. Unfortunately, all that seemed to do was make me mistrust large aeroplanes.": "Stanley",
  "The intercourse between the Mediterranean and the North or between the Atlantic and Central Europe was never purely economic or political it also meant the exchange of knowledge and ideas and the influence of social institutions and artistic and literary forms. ": "Christopher",
  "The idea would be in my mind - and I know it sounds strange - is that the most important advances in medicine would be made not by new knowledge in molecular biology, because that's exceeding what we can even use. It'll be made by mathematicians, physicists, computer scientists, figuring out a way to get all that information together.": "Patrick",
  "The development of the telescope, together with increased knowledge of things, brought men to see that the earth is not what man had once thought it to be.": "Joseph",
  "It's clear that people are going to download media files, and they're going to talk to each other, and they're going to exchange information and knowledge and so forth. So this system logic is basically what you bounce off of.": "Michael",
  "I think that probably the most important thing about our education was that it taught us to question even those things we thought we knew. To say you've got to inquire, you've got to be testing your knowledge all the time in order to be more effective in what you're doing.": "Thabo",
  "Our civilization has evolved through the continuous adjustment of society to the stimulus of new knowledge.": "John",
  "When I entered medical physics in 1958 there were fewer than 100 in the U.S. and I could see many opportunities to apply my knowledge of nuclear physics.": "John",
  "Science has to be understood in its broadest sense, as a method for comprehending all observable reality, and not merely as an instrument for acquiring specialized knowledge.": "Alexis",

  "If we want to implement climate protection worldwide, countries like Germany, which are capable of developing new technologies, will have to hand over some of their knowledge. We can't expect to have our cake and eat it too.": "Sigmar",

  "The university's business is the conservation of useless knowledge; and what the university itself apparently fails to see is that this enterprise is not only noble but indispensable as well, that society can not exist unless it goes on.": "Albert",

  "Knowledge is only one half. Faith is the other.": "Novalis",
  "A lot of knowledge in any kind of an organization is what we call task knowledge. These are things that people who have been there a long time understand are important, but they may not know how to talk about them. It's often called the culture of the organization.": "Howard",
  "It's hard for women to talk about these things, and for the doctors to really talk about it too, and to even have the knowledge of what's going on. That's why I'm doing this and urging women to speak out and talk to their doctors frankly.": "Cybill",

  "You should welcome getting older in golf. With greater knowledge of your swing, you, too, can keep improving.": "Angel",

  "The clever cat eats cheese and breathes down rat holes with baited breath.": "W.",
  "Just like hair frames our face, brows frame our eyes. I see so much potential in harmonized beauty whenever I see a woman who's not filling in her brows, and I just want to go in with my brow pencil and just be like, 'Filling in eyebrows, OK, done - look in the mirror and be inspired.' That's one of my pet peeves, but beauty is subjective.": "Michelle",
  "What a dog I got, his favorite bone is in my arm.": "Rodney",
  "If cats were double the size they are now, they'd probably be illegal.": "Douglas",
  "You know what I hate? I hate people who give me plants. The whole giving someone plants - it's like giving someone a pet.

  "I hate when people don't keep their word or they are late. Tardiness is a big pet peeve of mine.": "Tim",

  "I don't have a pet, but I dream of someday getting a pug dog whom I will name Croque Monsieur so that I may alternate between calling him Croque, Monsieur or his full name: Croque Monsieur. I'll more than likely only use his first and last name most often when he's been bad.": "John",

  "I wish people would realize that animals are totally dependent on us, helpless, like children, a trust that is put upon us.": "James",
  "My mother and dad were big animal lovers, too. I just don't know how I would have lived without animals around me. I'm fascinated by them - both domestic pets and the wild community. They just are the most interesting things in the world to me, and it's made such a difference in my lifetime.": "Betty",
  "Owners lavish love on their pets, which is why so many go from non-aggressive pups to being out of control when they're older. People just don't realise their dog must respect them as leader of the pack.": "Cesar",
  "I always pet a dog with my left hand because if he bit me I'd still have my right hand to paint with.": "Juan",
  "For many people who are so lost in their minds, so much involved in their thought processes, the only moments they have when they are not trapped in that is when they are relating to their animal, their pet.": "Eckhart",
  "The kinds of roles dogs fill can be hard to come by in human relationships. We touch the dog or the pet at whim. There is a lack of self-consciousness and a fluidity to it that is absent from most human relationships. If someone acted that way to you, you'd feel claustrophobic pretty quickly. It's a boundary violation.": "Caroline",
  "I fed my yak on my spare Cadbury chocolate 21,0000ft up Everest. It was a blonde, very sweet female yak. I made it my pet after that.": "Brian",

  "If a dog jumps into your lap, it is because he is fond of you; but if a cat does the same thing, it is because your lap is warmer.": "Alfred",
  "We long for an affection altogether ignorant of our faults. Heaven has accorded this to us in the uncritical canine attachment.": "George",

  "Every time someone buys a cat or a dog from a breeder or a pet shop, a cat on the streets or in an animal shelter loses his or her chance at finding a good home.": "Amy",
  "I had a big Akita, Yoshi, who was fabulous. I loved him. We lost him when he was 12, and I've never been able to replace him. Normally, most people lose a pet and get another and keep going on. But it just felt wrong to me; it felt disloyal.": "Robert",
  "My dream pet? I like a couple of them, man: monkey, I love dogs. See, tigers, I don't know - I can't be playing with something like that. A monkey, I can handle it. A dog, yeah; I would get a monkey.": "French",
  "I don't micromanage, but I do care deeply about every product we make. Every one goes through me, and I try most of our products before they go to market, including our John Paul Pet flea and tick shampoo. If I don't like it, it's not coming out.": "John",
  "My campaign is about getting pets to be more active, and exercise with your animal is a great way for people to exercise. When you're out with your pet, it becomes fun. You don't think of it as a chore. For me, taking my dog out for a walk is very relaxing.": "Misty",
  "Chadron had a water tower, grain elevators, a tanning salon, a video rental store, a small liberal arts college, a Hardee's, a stoplight, and a curling yellow sign in the pet store window that read, 'Hamsters and Tarantulas Featured Today.'": "Poe",

  "One of my pet peeves is when people think that pop guys go country when they can't make it in pop anymore.": "Darius",
  "That's one of my pet peeves. People always want to put something into a category - this one or that one. You know, a great song is a great song.": "Darius",
  "One of my pet peeves about Nashville is that it tends to be copycatted. I don't want to do that. I've got to be different.": "Blake",
  "I kind of imagine myself at eighty, a cat lady.": "Juliette",
  "Like most people, I have several pet subjects - that may or may not be interesting to other people. Don't get me started on happiness, or habits, or children's literature, or Winston Churchill, unless you really want to talk about it.": "Gretchen",
  "My biggest pet peeve is when you go to a fine restaurant, and it's like a mausoleum inside. Good food should be joyful. There should be laughter and chatter, not people sitting there like they're in a funeral-parlor waiting room.": "Jim",
  "I do feel like by buying rats from a pet store, you are saving them because if not, they would get fed to a snake or something.": "Nikki",
  "I think there's something great and generic about goldfish. They're everybody's first pet.": "Paul",
  "The first pet I remember was a cat called Baby. She would sleep with me, and I could call her from anywhere, and she would come running.": "Ashton",

  "I have a real pet peeve for women who play damaged characters but don't look damaged.": "Patty",
  "My pet peeve and my goal in life is to somehow get an adjective for 'integrity' in the dictionary. 'Truthful' doesn't really cover it, or 'genuine.' It should be like 'integritus.'": "Rashida",
  "There are people all over the world who like to write fan letters in the voice of their pet: 'Hello, my name is Fifi and I'm a labrador and I think you're great. Paw paw!'": "Rebecca",
  "For me, it's always been one of my pet peeves to keep people engaged and talking, and just always being interested in what I have going on. To keep the level of creativity always turned up to the max.": "Future",
  "In truth, I'm not really a cat person. Seamus, the wonder dog, still deeply mourned by all who knew him, was just about the only pet I've ever really loved.": "Michael",
  "Pet foods come in a variety of flavors because that's what humans like, and we assume our pets like what we like. We're wrong.": "Mary",
  "No one ever pretended that shopping for anything is a rational experience. If it were, would there be Fluffernutter? Laceless sneakers? Porkpie hats? Would the Chia Pet even exist?": "Jeffrey",
  "A pet store is a celebration of dogs' existence and an explosion of options. About cats, a pet store seems to say, 'Here, we couldn't think of anything else.' Cats are the Hanukkah of the animal world in this way. They are feted quietly and happily by a minority, but there's only so much hoopla applicable to them.": "Sloane",
  "My big pet peeve with people posting food - and I love it when people post food - but my number one thing is when you're posting at a restaurant, and it's dark, like a date night, food never looks good. Flash looks horrible, no flash looks horrible. It's important to only do food photos during daylight - and it's all about color with Instagram.": "Chrissy",
  "I need to be able to be at a gig and just put my bag on the floor and not worry about it being stood on or getting ruined. You want a bag that can go through anything. And a little bit of softness is always lovely. If I don't have a dog, I can just pet my bag!": "Cara",
  "If you have time to get your pet rabbit its own Instagram account, you have time to at least tweet about something important.": "Jameela",
  "It is a pet peeve of mine when people throw around arguments citing 'Fair Use' and yet fail to actually explain what a fair use argument actually is.": "Rachel",
  "I try not to wear anything I have to fidget with - there's nothing worse than wearing something and pulling down the hem and re-adjusting the top. My pet hate is when girls wear those strapless dresses and spend the whole night yanking them up.": "Sophie",
  "Some men over-tweeze their eyebrows, and it's just too perfect. Men are meant to have kind of a bushy brow. Too much aftershave is also off-putting; it's one of my pet hates.": "David",
  "It's a little known fact that one in three family pets gets lost during its lifetime, and approximately 9 million pets enter shelters each year. That's why it's a wonderful thing to get your pet microchipped and registered with your contact information because then they can be located and the owners can track where their pets are.": "Betty",
  "Growing up, I had an insane crush on Neil Tennant of the Pet Shop Boys.": "Erin",

  "When I was a kid, I was obsessed with different planets in the solar system, and I used to create, for every single planet, a different alien race with a certain kind of pet, a certain kind of house, a certain kind of water system, and everything. I would draw these pictures. I had hundreds of these pictures in a box.": "James",
  "We've begun to long for the pitter-patter of little feet - so we bought a dog. Well, it's cheaper, and you get more feet.": "Rita",
  "In their heyday, the Pet Shop Boys were the Interpol of the Eighties, dressing up to sing really weird pop songs about lust and loneliness in the big city. They're low-pro now, not retro-worshipped in the manner of Depeche Mode, New Order, or The Cure, but you can hear the reason why - these guys are too sad.": "Rob",
  "One of the most obvious ways dogs can improve our physical and mental health is via daily walks.": "Andrew",
  "My college friends call me Karu, which is the worst. Only in our country can we make a short form for a short name. But otherwise, I've never had a pet name all my life. But now, in official meetings, someone will call me KJo. And I'll judge that person in my head. Just call me Karan.": "Karan",
  "We have a habit of turning to scientists when we want factual answers and artists when we want entertainment, but where are the facts about the nature of the self? Neurologists peering at PET scans and fMRIs know they aren't seeing the soul in there.": "James",
  "When you want a break from dogs, and you take them to the kennel to the stars, no one thinks you're a bad pet owner. But when you have kids, you can't drop them off for three weeks without someone calling Child Protective Services!": "Gabrielle",
  "I love the ubiquitous idly-dosa combination. In fact, that was my pet name as a kid! In school, I would bug the canteen boys to get me my daily quota of idly!": "Hansika",
  "When a guy tells me I'm cute, it's not something desirable. Cute is more like what you want your pet to be.": "Natalie",
  "I can't imagine God not allowing my dog into heaven.": "Rick",
  "When you're fighting for social justice, one of my biggest pet peeves is speaking out of ignorance.": "Eva",
  "Our pets rely on us entirely for their nutrition. So if you're making your own judgments, that could lead to a mistake. At the same time, we have more control over our pet's diet than we do with our children or with ourselves, so your vet can tell you what is appropriate for your dog and you can assign them that.": "Alison",
  "All writers have their own pet commandments.": "Darin",
  "I love animals. I just don't want to have a pet. That's OK, right? I would take a dog over a cat, at least to interact with you. I feel like cats just stare you down all the time. Cats have, like, bad attitudes.": "Erin",
  "I hate rats. I had a pet rat to try and overcome it. I even gave him mouth-to mouth resuscitation when he had a heart attack. But I couldn't conquer it.": "Sam",
  "A lover tries to stand in well with the pet dog of the house.": "Moliere",
  "In summation, like your beloved pet rock, Twitter is useful only in your imagination.": "David",

  "It doesn't work if the bad guys kill his mother's uncle's friend's neighbor's pet dog. You've got to make the stakes high.": "Steven",
  "I have more pet peeves than anybody: people talking in the movie theater, people eating in the movie theater loudly, people being rude, people making noise when you're supposed to be asleep, like drilling noises outside. I could be here all day.": "Kate",
  "I really want a pet, and I really love animals.": "Aurora",
  "We created a line of pet food called Nutrish that's made to human standards, and 100 percent of the proceeds go to animal rescue. One of our top-tier donors is the ASPCA, and they help us challenge animal shelters all across the country to get more animals placed in homes.": "Rachael",
  "I have a lot of trouble understanding how people see me as a celebrity. I work 14 hours a day, and then I just want to talk to my family, see the people I love, pet my dog, and go to bed. I'm not looking to be best friends with or emulate a celebrity.": "America",
  "I have the same pet peeve as Anderson Cooper, which is bare feet in public. I hate it. It so grosses me out, especially in New York. Oh my God, New York in the summer with people and their feet in their sandals and their flip-flops, like get it away!": "Busy",
  "I'm a dog person, but I don't have a pet.": "Timothy",
  "I think you can totally be a totally normal kid from the suburbs of Chicago and go off and play shows. It's one of those things that when you go home, you're still the nerd you were when you left, and your parents still get to yell at you about cleaning up your room, and your girlfriend still drags you to the pet store.": "Patrick",
  "My pet peeve is when people criticize things when they're just trying to have a conversation.": "Jeff",
  "Truth be told, ginormous portions have become a pet peeve of mine.": "Hal",
  "I don't have pet peeves I have whole kennels of irritation. ": "Whoopi",
  "People didn't think animals thought or remembered or had minds! They most certainly do: any pet owner knows more than a lot of scientists about animals.": "Elizabeth",
  "My little dog, he did not get ill. It is so funny that people get ill on a boat and dogs do not.": "Anna",
  "I love cats.": "Dick",
  "We wanted a pet food based on sound scientific principles and truth, not marketing hype.": "Dick",
  "If I was good each week, my father would take me to a different pet store each Saturday. I had a snake, horny toads, turtles, lizards, rabbits, guinea pigs... I kept my alligator in the bathtub until it got too big.": "Dick",
  "A hungry dog hunts best. A hungrier dog hunts even better.": "Norman",

  "Many who have spent a lifetime in it can tell us less of love than the child that lost a dog yesterday.": "Thornton",
  "My pet peeves are people touching me a lot. Random dudes grabbing me and slapping me across the back. They're not doing it on purpose, but it's like they forget I'm a person. But you can't do anything about it. What are you going to do?": "Rob",
  "Dachshunds are ideal dogs for small children, as they are already stretched and pulled to such a length that the child cannot do much harm one way or the other.": "Robert",
  "Don't buy furs: that's No. 1. You can start with that. Then spay and neuter your pets. We destroy millions of them a year. Go to an animal shelter for a cat or dog. And read a book about how to care properly for your particular pet.": "Loretta",
  "I have a little bit of a pet peeve about how the middle class is depicted in movies. I feel like they tend to be either depicted in a very sentimental way, where everybody has a heart of gold except for the villains you're supposed to hiss at, or there's a sort of indie-style version... When it's done well, it's brilliant, it's 'Blue Velvet.'": "Greg",
  "One of my biggest pet peeves is when a guy's wearing flip-flop sandals, which I don't understand. Men's feet are disgusting to begin with, but now they're on display when I try to go out for a nice steak at a restaurant, and I have to sit there and look at some guy's hoof? I don't get it. I don't understand it.": "Sebastian",
  "My parents were very permissive when it came to animals. As long as we earned the money to buy them and built whatever structure it was they were going to live in, we could have any kind of pet we wanted. They would have let us have a rhinoceros if we could have afforded it.": "Maggie",
  "Ill-fitted T-shirts stretched over a gut are my pet hate. And if the colour's faded - ugh.": "Joanne",
  "For every book that I write... I develop a history for each person and make sure they are well rounded and flawed.

  "If you're trying to cut down the distance travelled from the farm to your plate, it makes sense to do the same for your pet. If we all shifted our bias towards sustainable pet food, we would be helping more than just our faithful friends.": "Sheherazade",
  "I do not believe that I will ever write an adult novel from an animal's point of view unless someday it becomes suddenly appealing to me to make a narrator a mentally ill pet. Never say never.": "Andrea",

  "The world spends $40 billion a year on pet food.": "Nicholas",
  "I've been lucky. I've made films that I really like. It's been a combination of what comes to me and what I choose. I've gone after lots of things that I didn't get, pet projects that everybody ends up chasing after. Really, you're lucky if you get anything.": "Hope",
  "I grew up with a pet iguana named Willy. We had a very contentious relationship. It turns out that iguanas are not meant to live in suburban homes.": "Kate",

  "My mom didn't believe in putting chemicals in hair. But when I got to college, we didn't have A/C in our dorms freshman year. So after several days of waking up looking like a Chia Pet, I was like 'OK, I'm gonna get a perm.' And then my hair revolted and fell out. I was over that quick, fast and in a hurry.": "Keshia",
  "Once they become AKC registered, the newspapers will become flooded with ads for them. And you'll see Border collies in pet stores and animal shelters.": "Donald",
  "Though each trainer believes his or her method is best, I don't think it matters which method the pet owner adopts so long as that owner finds a capable mentor and sticks with the training. Eventually you will learn to see your dog, and when that happens, the richness of your and your dog's lives will tell you what to do next.": "Donald",
  "Every time I decide I want a child I get another pet. I have 3 dogs, 13 birds and 3 horses, what does that tell you?": "Alyssa",

  "Children are my pet cause. I have a foster child in El Salvador, and whenever I'm home, I work for the Adam Walsh Foundation, which finds missing children. I also do some hospital visits and other things for the Make-a-Wish Foundation.": "Jane",
  "You can get too bogged down in technology and you can sort of forget what it is you were trying to do. And with the Pet Shop Boys it's primarily about the songs, it's about song writing.": "Chris",
  "I could never date a guy with a pet snake.": "Genesis",
  "There are things that I invented - the creaky geriatric robot that is always grumpy, for example, or the little wheelie guy, he's not in the Hasbro lore. But kids love that stuff - this little guy as a pet on a chain. They gravitate towards it.": "Michael",

  "We all have our pet things that we like to get religious about.": "Max",
  "Pet lovers know that animals sometimes understand us better than we do, and the annals of human sin and desire provide plenty of stories to drive the point home.": "Tony",
  "I've teamed up with PetSmart Charities to celebrate the five million homeless pets who've found homes through their in-store adoption centers, and to spread the word about how we can work together to save millions more pets' lives and, ultimately, end pet homelessness.": "Josh",
  "There is something very independent about French balloons - you feel you couldn't make a pet of one.": "Elizabeth",

  "Why would you want to do anything else but rescue a pet?": "Paul",
  "Actually, my dog I think is the only person who consistently loves me all the time.": "H.",
  "I'm not a big pet fan. I remember the school used to have a hamster, and you used to take it home for a week at a time. I did that. I probably got bored of it within a day.": "George",
  "It is one of my pet hates when I see players who have agents who do everything for them. They don't know how to set up their own bank accounts, they don't know what they are spending their money on and they can't make their own decisions.": "Gary",

  "Dogs are my favorite people.": "Richard",
  "We are telling veterans they must sacrifice to pay for the pet projects and contracts to campaign donors of powerful members of Congress.": "Nick",

  "It is impossible for a lover of cats to banish these alert, gentle, and discriminating friends, who give us just enough of their regard and complaisance to make us hunger for more.": "Agnes",
  "I was very short. Everybody else was two years older in my class, and I had curly hair and was teacher's pet.": "Howard",

  "Gypsy was the name my brother gave a pet turtle he had. I always thought it was so peculiar.": "Joel",
  "I do have the most adorable little Chihuahua mix. I adopted him about 3 1/2 years ago from Much Love pet adoption, and he has been the love of my life ever since. His name is Beau, or as my sister and I like to call him ' mushy mush' because he truly is just a pile of loving mush that just melts in your arms.": "Torrey",
  "My biggest pet peeve is when people don't admit what they've done.": "Daniela",
  "I spent a lot of time in the White House in the public areas where reporters are allowed to go, but I spoke to people about the private quarters as well. Some of the things I learned were small, novelistic details. For example, the fact that there were still pet stains on the carpets from the Bush cats when the Obamas moved in.": "Jodi",
  "Crabbed and obscure definitions are of no use beyond a narrow circle of students, of whom probably every one has a pet one of his own.": "Frederick",
  "I was raised in a strict Southern household in Lexington, South Carolina, and I remember sneaking off to watch 'Pet Cemetery' as a kid. After seeing those animals reincarnate, I screamed and couldn't sleep for weeks, but watched it again and again.": "Jessica",
  "People buy a cat and think, 'Oh that's a beautiful collar. I'll put that on,' but that doesn't make them a responsible pet owner.": "Celia",
  "All I want in life is to pet my dog and cat. After that, all I want to do is post photos of them. Mostly because they're the cutest things ever, but also because I don't have to worry about how ugly I look in the photo.": "Cazzie",
  "I want to be a lawyer, a dancer, an actress, a mother, a wife, a children's author, a distance runner, a poet, a pianist, a pet store owner, an astronaut, an environmental and humanitarian activist, a psychiatrist, a ballet teacher, and the first woman president.": "Rachel",
  "Pet me, touch me, love me, that's what I get when I perform. That's when I'm really getting what I want.": "Connie",
  "A lizard is a perfect pet for a model. They only need feeding once a fortnight. And I'm always travelling, so it's perfect. If I had a dog, it would drop dead of starvation.": "Abbey",
  "I started keeping track of my pet peeves and so far have counted over 160... but to pick one: muffins. They're imposters. They think they're breakfast food, but really, they are just terrible cupcakes.": "Aubrey",
  "Millions of animals are euthanized every year because shelters can't find homes for them. Buying animals from pet stores also tends to support puppy and cat mills, many of which have deplorable conditions for animals, which shouldn't be tolerated.": "Laura",
  "I am a pet person. My dog actually lives in Georgia now. But I work with animal trainers and pets quite often. I also volunteer at different places like animal shelters. It's good to be around pets. They kind of put things into perspective. They're easygoing, loyal, and they seem to get it, even when humans don't.": "Alyson",
  "I was in New York and I walked into this pet store and came out with a dog.": "Beverley",
  "Pet stores just sell their animals.": "Booboo",
  "One of my obsession is animals. I'm into dog rescues. It drives me crazy when people go to pet stores and buy dogs. There are so many dogs that need a good home. And this sounds crazy, but I really believe they know what is happening and are appreciative, and I just think they make for the best pets.": "Jim",
  "A move to a different town or school gives us new places to explore, new people to meet; a lost pet means we have to organize a careful search; baby-sitting requires looking out for dangers a young child can't foresee; a car crash or fire demands that we get help immediately.": "Jim",
  "Our cat is kind dove shellfish, and thinks the world is hers, She finds a comfy spot and then we pet turtle sheep purrs.": "Brian",
  "My biggest pet peeve are just girls who go to sports bars who have no intention on caring what teams are playing, like they're looking for just a night out. That drives me more crazy than anything else. Like, don't pretend to be a sports fan.": "Jerry",
  "The same regions of the brain light up when someone touches their smartphone as when they touch a family member or a pet.": "Matt",

  "I was in three academic clubs, a huge book worm and the teacher's pet. I was kind of an easy target for bullies.": "Nicole",
  "I was home schooled in high school but was definitely the nerd in middle school. I was in three academic clubs, a huge book worm, and the teacher's pet. I was kind of an easy target for bullies.": "Nicole",
  "Nothing gives me quite so much joy as when people tell me they've had their pets spayed or neutered.": "Bob",
  "I'm a fan of the old 'Creature Features' like 'Critters,' and 'Gremlins' and 'Tremors.' 'Jaws' is classic. It's funny that I still like those films because I remember my mom would tease me about getting a pet Critter to keep under my bed.": "Brooke",
  "I'm a writer who stacks cat food for a living. It's true: I have a master's degree in creative writing, I've published two critically successful books, and I get paid to replenish the shelves of my local food co-op with pet food, sponges and toilet paper. Nine days out of 10, I do it quite happily.": "Ali",
  "I've got a new invention. It's a revolving bowl for tired goldfish.": "Lefty",
  "To this day I don't ever remember seeing a pet inside Moscow, I never saw anyone carrying a dog, or leading a dog. Err I finally saw a, a pet some years later in Kiev, so I thought that life must have been, different.": "Ralph",
  "It's true, you can never eat a pet you name. And anyway, it would be like a ventriloquist eating his dummy.": "Alexander",
  "And I strongly believe people should rescue dogs, or, at the very least, listen to Bob Barker and have your pet spayed or neutered.": "Justin",
  "One of my biggest pet peeves is that I just don't like it when characters do things that are funny to the writer, but you don't know why they're doing it and it doesn't make any sense.": "Glenn",

  "A man's country is not a certain area of land, of mountains, rivers, and woods, but it is a principle and patriotism is loyalty to that principle.": "George",
  "Memorial Day isn't just about honoring veterans, its honoring those who lost their lives. Veterans had the fortune of coming home. For us, that's a reminder of when we come home we still have a responsibility to serve. It's a continuation of service that honors our country and those who fell defending it.": "Pete",

  "Experience tells you what to do confidence allows you to do it. ": "Stan",

  "Along the way, let's never forget that once we were children and that we were all playing together without distinction of skin color, society level, or where people come from. Adults need to remember to play and to be more childlike in our behavior. We've forgotten what that childlike experience was like.": "Guy",
  "See any detour as an opportunity to experience new things.": "H.",
  "Making sushi is an art, and experience is everything.": "Nobu",
  "Your life changes. Everything has to be done perfectly, and I didn't follow that. I lived my life as if I wasn't in the public eye. I thought, 'I'm young. I have the right to experience new things, and if I want to go to a bar and get drunk, that's my prerogative.'": "Shannen",
  "A spy, like a writer, lives outside the mainstream population. He steals his experience through bribes and reconstructs it.": "John",

  "The years teach much which the days never know.": "Ralph",
  "There are many truths of which the full meaning cannot be realized until personal experience has brought it home.": "John",
  "The world sometimes feels like an insane asylum. You can decide whether you want to be an inmate or pick up your visitor's badge. You can be in the world but not engage in the melodrama of it you can become a spiritual being having a human experience thoroughly and fully. ": "Deepak",
  "We cannot control what emotions or circumstances we will experience next, but we can choose how we will respond to them.": "Gary",

  "In my experience, being busy and working hard is the key to sanity/happiness.": "Jemima",
  "The role of a goalkeeper is difficult to judge, above all if you haven't been a goalkeeper. It's like me giving an opinion on someone's job without having had any experience in their sector. You start to realise how many stupid things are said and written about goalkeepers.": "Gianluigi",
  "The historical experience of socialist countries has sadly demonstrated that collectivism does not do away with alienation but rather increases it, adding to it a lack of basic necessities and economic inefficiency.": "Pope",
  "Skill is the unified force of experience, intellect and passion in their operation.": "John",
  "People are always fascinated by infidelity because, in the end - whether we've had direct experience or not - there's part of you that knows there's absolutely no more piercing betrayal. People are undone by it.": "Junot",
  "Real estate sales was perfect training for the experience to go into public life because you learn to accept rejection, learn to meet new people, learn to work with people and find common ground. That's the way you sell houses... that's also the way you win over constituency.": "Johnny",
  "As children, our imaginations are vibrant, and our hearts are open. We believe that the bad guy always loses and that the tooth fairy sneaks into our rooms at night to put money under our pillow. Everything amazes us, and we think anything is possible. We continuously experience life with a sense of newness and unbridled curiosity.": "Yehuda",
  "I believe the process of going from confusion to understanding is a precious, even emotional, experience that can be the foundation of self-confidence.": "Brian",
  "Great art - or good art - is when you look at it, experience it and it stays in your mind. I don't think conceptual art and traditional art are all that different.": "Damien",
  "You cannot, in human experience, rush into the light. You have to go through the twilight into the broadening day before the noon comes and the full sun is upon the landscape.": "Woodrow",
  "The traveler was active; he went strenuously in search of people, of adventure, of experience. The tourist is passive; he expects interesting things to happen to him. He goes 'sight-seeing.'": "Daniel",
  "I was so emotional. Choked up. I could hardly talk all day. I'll be cleaning out my trailer and saying goodbye soon, realizing what a wonderful experience this has been.": "Dennis",
  "Experience has taught me how important it is to just keep going, focusing on running fast and relaxed. Eventually it passes and the flow returns. It's part of racing.": "Frank",
  "When you experience the emotion of sadness, there will be changes in facial expression, and your body will be closed in, withdrawn. There are also changes in your heart, your guts: they slow down. And there are hormonal changes.": "Antonio",
  "Wisdom and penetration are the fruit of experience, not the lessons of retirement and leisure. Great necessities call out great virtues.": "Abigail",
  "I got to experience a world championship with some great teammates.": "Kirk",
  "My purpose in performing is to communicate the joy I experience in living.": "John",
  "Meaning is something we experience more than we attain. It's like finding a nice, easy current in a river that carries you through life.": "Donald",
  "My ultimate aim is to make euthanasia a positive experience.": "Jack",
  "I don't differentiate between black and Latino actors. We're in the same struggle to be represented in a way that's even close to honest. And I can tell you that the amount of Latino characters I can point at and say, 'That's what my life experience looks like' - I can't think of any off the top of my head besides Jimmy Smits in 'Mi Familia.'": "Lin-Manuel",
  "Culture means, I think, that you have widened your experience enough through reading and through being a little bit thoughtful about these things that it has changed your outlook in some ways. And not necessarily made you a better human being but made you see things.": "Joseph",
  "You don't have to be a chef or even a particularly good cook to experience proper kitchen alchemy: the moment when ingredients combine to form something more delectable than the sum of their parts. Fancy ingredients or recipes not required; simple, made-up things are usually even better.": "Erin",
  "If there's any object in human experience that's a precedent for what a computer should be like, it's a musical instrument: a device where you can explore a huge range of possibilities through an interface that connects your mind and your body, allowing you to be emotionally authentic and expressive.": "Jaron",
  "We shall not grow wiser before we learn that much that we have done was very foolish.": "Friedrich",
  "Filmmaking is a huge privilege; it's not brain surgery. It's art, and art is supposed to be an enjoyable process, and it is an enjoyable experience for me.": "Lake",

  "To have God speak to the heart is a majestic experience, an experience that people may miss if they monopolize the conversation and never pause to hear God's responses.": "Charles",
  "I experience a period of frightening clarity in those moments when nature is so beautiful. I am no longer sure of myself, and the paintings appear as in a dream.": "Vincent",
  "A lot of things you see as a child remain with you... you spend a lot of your life trying to recapture the experience.": "Tim",
  "Sydney's a beautiful city. It was a great experience.": "Barbara",
  "While films are a very visual and emotional artistic medium, video games take it one step further into the realm of a unique personal experience.": "Jet",
  "The Louvre for me is a wonderful experience. Because it continues; it didn't get cut off. It was actually a continuous involvement all the way, and a lot of people have come and gone, come and gone; but I'm still here.": "I.",
  "The whole world, as we experience it visually, comes to us through the mystic realm of color.": "Hans",
  "Everything that we experience every day leaves a long-lasting impression.": "Pharrell",
  "Faces are the ledgers of our experience.": "Richard",
  "The dominant characteristic of an authentic spiritual life is the gratitude that flows from trust - not only for all the gifts that I receive from God, but gratitude for all the suffering. Because in that purifying experience, suffering has often been the shortest path to intimacy with God.": "Brennan",
  "All experience is an arch, to build upon.": "Henry",
  "As a former Airman First Class in the United States Air Force, like many veterans in America, my military experience played an important part in instilling in me a sense of character and discipline that has served me throughout my life.": "Chuck",

  "We deem those happy who from the experience of life have learnt to bear its ills without being overcome by them.": "Carl",
  "The beauty of dystopia is that it lets us vicariously experience future worlds - but we still have the power to change our own.": "Ally",
  "Our DNA is as a consumer company - for that individual customer who's voting thumbs up or thumbs down. That's who we think about. And we think that our job is to take responsibility for the complete user experience. And if it's not up to par, it's our fault, plain and simply.": "Steve",
  "You don't take a class you're thrown into motherhood and learn from experience. ": "Jennie",
  "Adolescence is a time in which you experience everything more intensely.": "Edward",
  "All growth is a leap in the dark, a spontaneous unpremeditated act without benefit of experience.": "Henry",
  "But my experience is that people who have been through painful, difficult times are filled with compassion.": "Amy",
  "People who ask confidently get more than those who are hesitant and uncertain. When you've figured out what you want to ask for, do it with certainty, boldness and confidence. Don't be shy or feel intimidated by the experience. You may face some unexpected criticism, but be prepared for it with confidence.": "Jack",
  "While everyone's experience of oppression is different and complicated and often overlapping, I really believe that if you have privilege, you need to learn as much as you can about the world beyond yourself.": "Kathleen",
  "Life experience brings out different emotions and different perspectives on things. I just want to be constantly evolving.": "Kiesza",
  "I just love coming to Vegas. There is always a good energy here; the minute you get off the plane, it is happy. Every experience I have had here is fun, and everyone is in a good mood; they are happy, and they let it go. I like that. It is refreshing to me.": "Kelly",

  "Experience is a good school. But the fees are high.": "Heinrich",
  "Our experience is composed rather of illusions lost than of wisdom acquired.": "Joseph",

  "Experience: that most brutal of teachers. But you learn, my God do you learn.": "William",
  "Video games are a special kind of play, but at root, they're about the same things as other games: embracing particular rules and restrictions in order to develop skills and experience rewards. When a game is well-designed, it's the balance between these factors that engages people on a fundamental level.": "Tom",
  "I want to do everything. That's my problem. Life is short, and I hate the idea of turning down anything. You never know what interesting experience might happen.": "Joshua",
  "I was raised around a lot of artists, musicians, photographers, painters and people that were in theater. Just having the art-communal hippie experience as a child, there wasn't a clear line that was drawn. We celebrated creative experience and creative expression. We didn't try and curtail it and stunt any of that kind of growth.": "Jared",
  "Grief starts to become indulgent, and it doesn't serve anyone, and it's painful. But if you transform it into remembrance, then you're magnifying the person you lost and also giving something of that person to other people, so they can experience something of that person.": "Patti",
  "Everyone has a purpose in life and a unique talent to give to others. And when we blend this unique talent with service to others, we experience the ecstasy and exultation of own spirit, which is the ultimate goal of all goals.": "Kallam",

  "When you make a commitment to a relationship, you invest your attention and energy in it more profoundly because you now experience ownership of that relationship.": "Barbara",
  "There is no winning or losing, but rather the value is in the experience of imagining yourself as a character in whatever genre you're involved in, whether it's a fantasy game, the Wild West, secret agents or whatever else. You get to sort of vicariously experience those things.": "Gary",
  "You can never regret anything you do in life. You kind of have to learn the lesson from whatever the experience is and take it with you on your journey forward.": "Aubrey",
  "Whoever doesn't know it must learn and find by experience that 'a quiet conscience makes one strong!'": "Anne",
  "Writing, of course, is writing, acting comes from the theater, and cinematography comes from photography. Editing is unique to film. You can see something from different points of view almost simultaneously, and it creates a new experience.": "Stanley",
  "In almost everything, experience is more valuable than precept.": "Quintilian",
  "The human face is the organic seat of beauty. It is the register of value in development, a record of Experience, whose legitimate office is to perfect the life, a legible language to those who will study it, of the majestic mistress, the soul.": "Eliza",
  "My experience in Amsterdam is that cyclists ride where the hell they like and aim in a state of rage at all pedestrians while ringing their bell loudly, the concept of avoiding people being foreign to them.": "Terry",
  "There is only one thing which can master the perplexed stuff of epic material into unity; and that is, an ability to see in particular human experience some significant symbolism of man's general destiny.": "Lascelles",
  "We have all had the experience of finding that our reactions and perhaps even our deeds have denied beliefs we thought were ours.": "James",
  "When we learn from experience, the scars of sin can lead us to restoration and a renewed intimacy with God.": "Charles",
  "Every day is a new experience and I take it as it comes.": "Zac",
  "The hazing experience and then the subsequent participation in the group forces its members to maintain the status quo and traditions at all costs. It demands mindlessness and unquestioned loyalty, resulting in boring people who have little ability to think for themselves or have an opposing viewpoint from those who have the most social power.": "Rosalind",
  "The stuff that matters in life is no longer stuff. It's other people. It's relationships. It's experience.": "Brian",
  "I believe people can have a profound experience by being surrounded by something beautiful - that's what I aim for. My sculpture is about the way you feel when you're standing under it and inside it. It's experiential art.": "Janet",
  "Never, for the sake of peace and quiet, deny your own experience or convictions.": "Dag",
  "Tactics, fitness, stroke ability, adaptability, experience, and sportsmanship are all necessary for winning.": "Fred",
  "Certainly almost everything we do and think is colored in some way by memes, but it is important to realize that not everything we experience is a meme. If I walk down the street and see a tree, the basic perception that's going on is not memetic.": "Susan",
  "The problem isn't that people don't understand how good things are. It's that they know, from personal experience, that things really aren't that good.": "Paul",
  "You can learn more from the lows than the highs. The highs are great but the lows make you really look at things in a different way and want to improve. Every player will have both in their careers and I have, but what you get is that experience which is so important to perform at your best.": "Wayne",
  "It's a great, great experience to finally get the reception that you know you rightfully deserve.": "Kendrick",
  "Hurricanes are dangerous things, and they're no fun to go through. And if you come out of it in one piece and your house comes out of in one piece, it's no fun living with no electricity for a day or a week, a month, whatever it is. And I speak, unfortunately, from personal experience on that matter.": "Bernard",
  "Generally, our approach with products at Google is to first develop the right user base and then to figure out what's the right experience for the ads.": "Susan",
  "Experience teaches us that it is much easier to prevent an enemy from posting themselves than it is to dislodge them after they have got possession.": "George",
  "There are a lot of impractical things about owning a Porsche. But they're all offset by the driving experience. It really is unique. Lamborghinis and Ferraris come close. And they are more powerful, but they don't handle like a Porsche.": "Kevin",
  "The next time you experience a blackout, take some solace by looking at the sky. You will not recognize it.": "Nassim",
  "If we turn our backs of the Scythians who have provoked us, how shamefully shall we march against the revolted Bactrians; but if we pass Tanais and make the Scythians feel, by dear experience, that we are invincible, not in Asia only, it is not to be doubted but that Europe itself, as well as Asia, will come within the bounds of our conquests.": "Alexander",
  "When you have really exhausted an experience you always reverence and love it.": "Albert",
  "The noblest search is the search for excellence.": "Lyndon",
  "As a brand marketer, I'm a big believer in 'branding the customer experience,' not just selling the service.": "John",
  "Depression can kill you. It can also be a spiritually enriching experience. It's really an important part of my theology now and my spirituality that life is not perfect, and I grew up wanting it to be and thinking that if it wasn't, I could make it that way, and I had to acknowledge that I had all kinds of flaws and sadnesses and problems.": "Krista",
  "I know from experience that you should never give up on yourself or others, no matter what.": "George",
  "Everybody's got one killer story. It doesn't take talent to tell that story, it just takes experience.": "Kevin",
  "The main difference to me with Lyft is the sense of community and social experience. The pink mustache, fist bump and strict screening have fostered a strong sense of community with many stories of new friends, discovered jobs, and even some Lyft hugs after a tough break up.": "John",
  "Masterpieces are not single and solitary births; they are the outcome of many years of thinking in common, of thinking by the body of the people, so that the experience of the mass is behind the single voice.": "Virginia",
  "In order to experience everyday spirituality, we need to remember that we are spiritual beings spending some time in a human body.": "Barbara",
  "The world is given to me only once, not one existing and one perceived. Subject and object are only one. The barrier between them cannot be said to have broken down as a result of recent experience in the physical sciences, for this barrier does not exist.": "Erwin",
  "That's why, to experience that, you know for a fact that a human being is capable of so much more, because to go to that place and to step outside yourself and observe yourself do these things, while the rest of the world is moving in slow motion, is really incredible.": "Marcus",
  "There can be no greater error than to expect, or calculate, upon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which experience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.": "George",
  "I have such happy memories of performing in a choir and I don't think I'd have got where I am today without all that experience. So my advice to young singers is to either join your school or church's choir or find one in your local area. Choral music at any level teaches you so much about musicianship and blending your voice.": "Katherine",
  "Many times when you're a tourist you can just stay on the surface and not really experience the place you're visiting, which will probably leave you disappointed. Everywhere has something interesting; it's just about being curious enough to find it and scratch where you have to scratch and stay longer and walk further.": "Diego",
  "Example is the best precept.": "Aesop",
  "All experience is an arch wherethrough gleams that untravelled world whose margin fades for ever and for ever when I move.": "Alfred",

  "My experiences have taught me a lot and I'm happy with my learnings, if not with what I went through to learn.": "Ally",
  "To experience sublime natural beauty is to confront the total inadequacy of language to describe what you see. Words cannot convey the scale of a view that is so stunning it is felt.": "Eleanor",
  "As a country with experience of coping with earthquakes, tsunamis and other natural disasters, Japan believes in emphasizing the mainstreaming of disaster risk reduction. We therefore prioritize investment in disaster prevention and post-disaster improvements under a policy of Build Back Better (BBB).": "Shinzo",
  "Recommend virtue to your children; it alone, not money, can make them happy. I speak from experience.": "Ludwig",
  "The profoundly 'atomic' character of the universe is visible in everyday experience, in raindrops and grains of sand, in the hosts of the living, and the multitude of stars; even in the ashes of the dead.": "Pierre",
  "I always considered myself as a character actor. I always try to be versatile to show different sides of human experience.": "Robert",
  "One of the great cosmic laws, I think, is that whatever we hold in our thought will come true in our experience. When we hold something, anything, in our thought, then somehow coincidence leads us in the direction that we've been wishing to lead ourselves.": "Richard",
  "Experience has everywhere shown us, and especially in the Philippines, that the classes which are better off have always been addicted to peace and order because they live comparatively better and may be the losers in civil disturbances.": "Jose",
  "If you realize all the time what's kind of wonderful - that is, if we expand our experience into wilder and wilder regions of experience - every once in a while, we have these integrations when everything's pulled together into a unification, in which it turns out to be simpler than it looked before.": "Richard",
  "In times of rapid change, experience could be your worst enemy.": "J.",
  "One of the greatest moments in anybody's developing experience is when he no longer tries to hide from himself but determines to get acquainted with himself as he really is.": "Norman",
  "Because our entire universe is made up of consciousness, we never really experience the universe directly we just experience our consciousness of the universe, our perception of it, so right, our only universe is perception.": "Alan",
  "The box was a universe, a poem, frozen on the boundaries of human experience.": "William",
  "A Kiss concert experience is like sex or anything else that's done with more that one person. It's the give and take that makes it so great. When the audience takes it to the next level, we can kick it up another notch.": "Paul",
  "Recently, I was asked if I was going to fire an employee who made a mistake that cost the company $600,000. No, I replied, I just spent $600,000 training him. Why would I want somebody to hire his experience?": "Thomas",
  "You kind of invite a little spooky, creepy vibe into your whole experience of making a movie.": "Bruce",
  "And I came away from that experience, and it was a very difficult experience - I came to understand that you have to practice at being a good father and practice at being a good husband, just as you have to practice at being a good journalist.": "Bob",
  "I mean, if you didn't get it or if you didn't feel like you enjoyed it, sometimes that experience can change.": "Keanu",
  "To me the arcade experience is the ultimate gaming experience.": "Eugene",
  "I had a bad experience doing public speaking at school. I had to talk about a pen for five minutes and it was really hard work. I couldn't wait to get off the stage.": "Karl",
  "You don't know what unconditional love is. You may say you do, but if you don't have a child, you don't know what that is. But when you experience it, it is the most fulfilling ever.": "Regina",
  "I know from personal experience how damaging it can be to live with bitterness and unforgiveness. I like to say it's like taking poison and hoping your enemy will die. And it really is that harmful to us to live this way.": "Joyce",
  "But it's a journey and the sad thing is you only learn from experience, so as much as someone can tell you things, you have to go out there and make your own mistakes in order to learn.": "Emma",
  "Childhood depression tends to be more common in inner cities, being most frequently related to serious social deprivation, bullying, domestic violence, wartime experience and famine. It is, for example, a serious problem among children who are traumatised refugees.": "Robert",

  "At the outset, I want to say that the suggestion that the struggle in South Africa is under the influence of foreigners or communists is wholly incorrect. I have done whatever I did because of my experience in South Africa and my own proudly felt African background, and not because of what any outsider might have said.": "Nelson",
  "It's wonderful to be grateful. To have that gratitude well out from deep within you and pour out in waves. Once you truly experience this, you will never want to give it up.": "Srikumar",
  "Exile is not a time frame. Exile is an experience. It's a sentiment.": "Marco",
  "Hands-on experience is the best way to learn about all the interdisciplinary aspects of robotics.": "Rodney",
  "The diet is a twisted, noxious thing, all tortured abstinence and short-term fraud. I speak from bitter experience. As a restaurant critic, I eat to live and live to eat. And having a toxic aversion to exercise, there is little to prevent the inevitable bulging of my gut. Hence the need for the occasional diet.": "Tom",
  "As the technology is developed, autonomous driving could provide driving opportunities for the physically challenged or enable the elderly to continue driving longer. This will be vital as many nations experience an aging population.": "William",
  "When we started making 'Where You Live', I bought a bunch of Polaroid cameras in so that people could record the experience. Some of those pictures are in the CD sleeve.": "Tracy",

  "Life is the only real counselor wisdom unfiltered through personal experience does not become a part of the moral tissue. ": "Edith",

  "Of two pleasures, if there be one which all or almost all who have experience of both give a decided preference, irrespective of any feeling of moral obligation to prefer it, that is the more desirable pleasure.": "John",
  "Each of our 900 shows so far was different - maybe that's what makes the fans come back to our gigs time and again. And that they're always part of the show. Phish concerts are a communal experience.": "Page",
  "I mean, making art is about objectifying your experience of the world, transforming the flow of moments into something visual, or textual, or musical, whatever. Art creates a kind of commentary.": "Barbara",
  "Progress is measured by richness and intensity of experience - by a wider and deeper apprehension of the significance and scope of human existence.": "Herbert",
  "As seismologists gained more experience from earthquake records, it became obvious that the problem could not be reduced to a single peak acceleration. In fact, a full frequency of vibrations occurs.": "Charles",
  "I think experience will teach you a combination of liberalism and conservatism. We have to be progressive and at the same time we have to retain values. We have to hold onto the past as we explore the future.": "Oliver",
  "We are different, in essence, from other men. If you want to win something, run 100 meters. If you want to experience something, run a marathon.": "Emil",
  "Watching television in those days was not the same experience as it is today. After years of listening to radio, we found the black-and-white images mesmerizing.": "Annette",

  "I believe that anyone can conquer fear by doing the things he fears to do, provided he keeps doing them until he gets a record of successful experience behind him.": "Eleanor",
  "You are about to have your first experience with a Greek lunch. I will kill you if you pretend to like it.": "Jackie",
  "I don't think I've ever worked so hard on something, but working on Macintosh was the neatest experience of my life. Almost everyone who worked on it will say that. None of us wanted to release it at the end. It was as though we knew that once it was out of our hands, it wouldn't be ours anymore.": "Steve",
  "I've always loved the experience of working together with other people toward an artistic goal.": "Trey",
  "Yes, I've been trepanned. That's quite an interesting experience, especially for my brain surgeon, who saw my thoughts flying around in my brain.": "Keith",
  "Sometimes I get so bold and I'm so confident about what I'm doing that I actually try to be more of a dork because it's a really liberating feeling to experience what it's like to not care.": "John",
  "If you search and search and stop searching, then ultimately you'll find what you need. It is the experience of living.": "Marion",
  "If we didn't want to upset anyone, we would make films about sewing, but even that could be dangerous. But I think finally, in a film, it is how the balance is and the feelings are. But I think there has to be those contrasts and strong things within a film for the total experience.": "David",
  "I have a mess in my head sometimes, and there's something very satisfying about putting it into words. Certainly it's not something that you're in charge of, necessarily, but writing about it, putting it into your words, can be a very powerful experience.": "Carrie",
  "What an artist is trying to do for people is bring them closer to something, because of course art is about sharing. You wouldn't be an artist unless you wanted to share an experience, a thought.": "David",
  "Some writers can only deal with childhood experience, because it's complete. For another kind of writer, life goes on, and he's able to keep processing that as well.": "V.",
  "My advice would be to write what is most personal and specific to your experience or your life. And your voice will emerge and because of its specificity, it will be universal.": "David",
  "The magic happens when you take facts and figures, features and benefits, decks and PowerPoints - relatively soulless information - and embed them in the telling of a purposeful story. Your 'tell' renders an experience to your audience, making the information inside the story memorable, resonant and actionable.": "Peter",
  "I see the American experience as being defined by the immigrant paradigm of rupture and renewal: rupture with the old world, the old ways, and renewal of the self in a bright but difficult New World.": "Ayad",
  "Walk to work, even if it's four miles. Ride a bike to work. Drive a different way. On your way there, try to find beauty. You'd be surprised how much more of the neighborhood you can perceive and experience when you're looking for unique spots of beauty.": "Nolan",
  "From the Buddhist point of view, it is true that emptiness is a characteristic of all of life - if we look carefully at any experience we will find transparency, insubstantiality, with no solid, unchanging core to our experience. But that does not mean that nothing matters.": "Sharon",
  "Writing 'Book 1: The Maze of Bones' didn't feel much different than writing one of my other novels, but I thought it was very innovative to offer the website and trading card components as well for those readers who wanted to go more in depth with the Cahill experience.": "Rick",
  "The very first video experience I had was in high school. They brought a black-and-white closed-circuit surveillance camera into the classroom. I will never forget, as a kid, looking at that image.": "Bill",
  "My mother always read to me as a child. I really believe that bonding time between a parent and child is so important and precious. I have lasting memories of those stories because the experience was special.": "Mary",
  "As a direct line to human feeling, empathic experience, genuine language and detail, poetry is everything that headline news is not. It takes us inside situations, helps us imagine life from more than one perspective, honors imagery and metaphor - those great tools of thought - and deepens our confidence in a meaningful world.": "Naomi",
  "People often say that a bad event is a 'blessing in disguise.' Trust me, experience will teach you that some are unbelievably well disguised. Everyone gets fired, or decides to make a radical change at some point. Everyone suffers setbacks.": "Tom",
  "'Captain America' was probably the most universally positive experience I've had in this mad business.": "Joe",
  "No man has a right to expect to succeed in life unless he understands his business, and nobody can understand his business thoroughly unless he learns it by personal application and experience.": "P.",
  "My goal as a puzzle designer is to create a meaningful experience for the player, not just 'I solved it.'": "Scott",

  "Difficult times always create opportunities for you to experience more love in your life.": "Barbara",
  "Life experience is not something to be denied, but to be celebrated.": "Madeleine",
  "The book is actually called 'A Mentor Leader, a Different Way to Lead.' It really talks about my experience in the way I tried lead our football team, things that I learned from, basically, the coaches that I played for and my parents about leadership. And it is a little bit different, counter to maybe what society says about great leaders.": "Tony",
  "Language is not simply a reporting device for experience but a defining framework for it.": "Benjamin",
  "I know from personal experience how fear and low self worth can cripple one's ability to succeed in life. But with a little support, caring and inspiration, miracles can happen.": "Richard",

  "A few years' experience will convince us that those things which at the time they happened we regarded as our greatest misfortunes have proved our greatest blessings.": "George",
  "The deeper the experience of an absence of meaning - in other words, of absurdity - the more energetically meaning is sought.": "Vaclav",
  "Personal experience is the basis of all real Literature.": "George",
  "My friends, whoever has had experience of evils knows how whenever a flood of ills comes upon mortals, a man fears everything; but whenever a divine force cheers on our voyage, then we believe that the same fate will always blow fair.": "Aeschylus",
  "Fatigue is what we experience, but it is what a match is to an atomic bomb.": "Laura",
  "Any film, or to me any creative endeavour, no matter who you're working with, is, in many cases, a wonderful experience.": "Martin",
  "Natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by study; and studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except they be bounded in by experience.": "Francis",
  "Since the time of St. Jerome, it was mandatory for any kind of scholar or thinker to spend time out in the desert in solitude. It's no coincidence that the desert has been a major part of the visionary or mystical experience from the beginning of time.": "Bill",
  "When I'm writing, I'm constantly thinking about myself, because it's the only experience I have to draw on. And I don't see an exact reflection of myself in every face in the audience, but I know that my songs have validity to them, and that's why the fans are there.": "Chester",
  "As a medical doctor, it is my duty to evaluate the situation with as much data as I can gather and as much expertise as I have and as much experience as I have to determine whether or not the wish of the patient is medically justified.": "Jack",
  "Creativity and insight almost always involve an experience of acute pattern recognition: the eureka moment in which we perceive the interconnection between disparate concepts or ideas to reveal something new.": "Jason",
  "I'm getting asked a lot, 'You don't have kids, so how do you know how to act like a mother?' I know nothing could compare, and I haven't had that experience, but when my niece was born, I felt like I would jump in front of a car and die for this little person I didn't even know yet.": "Winona",
  "People think that their world will get smaller as they get older. My experience is just the opposite. Your senses become more acute. You start to blossom.": "Yoko",
  "Non-fiction, and in particular the literary memoir, the stylised recollection of personal experience, is often as much about character and story and emotion as fiction is.": "Chimamanda",
  "Experience is what you get while looking for something else.": "Federico",
  "Feeling earthquakes was part of growing up, and also preparing for them: doing earthquake drills, or having earthquake supplies. The looming feeling was part of my life. My experience of earthquakes has always been more the fear of them, or the possibility.": "Karen",
  "I grew up like a neglected weed - ignorant of liberty, having no experience of it.": "Harriet",
  "I have learned that a bitter experience can make you stronger. I now boastfully say that I have a hide like a rhinoceros... and I'm smiling. It's an interesting thing.": "Mel",
  "I developed a mechanism so that whatever mistakes I made, I would bounce straight back. Whatever was happening off the pitch, I could put it to one side and maintain my form. Call it mental resilience or a strong mind, but that is what we mean when we talk about experience in a football team.": "Gary",
  "The problem was to sustain at any cost the feeling you had in the theater that you were watching a real person, yes, but an intense condensation of his experience, not simply a realistic series of episodes.": "Arthur",
  "The wisdom of the wise, and the experience of ages, may be preserved by quotation.": "Isaac",

  "The kind of products you envision as an entrepreneur is a function of your life experience.": "Mitch",
  "When you're young, you don't have any experience - you're charged up, but you're out of control. And if you're old and you're not charged up, then all you have is memories. But if you're charged and stimulated by what's going on around you, and you also have experience, you know what to appreciate and what to pass by.": "Neil",
  "The wrong things are predominantly stressed in the schools - things remote from the student's experience and need.": "Anne",
  "It is a very busy mission: every day has some major goals that we have to get through, but my experience before has been that at least in the evening, you kind of take a deep breath and look around where you are and have some downtime.": "Linda",
  "The protests and pain over the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown had me wondering if we can ever experience the world as others do. For no matter how disputed the circumstances of both cases, many people see what happened in black and white.": "Campbell",
  "Extreme programming is an emotional experience.": "Kent",
  "Skydiving is special because it's almost the closest to an out-of-body experience you can have. We live in such a stimulated, connected, busy world - to be up in the air with nothing but yourself and the landscape is incredibly peaceful.": "Georgia",
  "Experience praises the most happy the one who made the most people happy.": "Karl",
  "I haven't been as wild with my money as somebody like me might have been. I've been very safe, very conservative with investments. I don't blow money. I don't have a ton of houses. I know things can go away. I've already had that experience.": "Jim",
  "In a multicultural, diverse society there are countless ways in which people negotiate the everyday lived experience and reality of diversity.": "Randa",
  "Barcelona is one of the best cities in the world. I love it there. I love Big Sur. It's stunning and you get a therapeutic experience there. The drive up the coast is one of the most beautiful I've ever done. Also, Hong Kong. I could easily live there!": "Meghan",
  "With tennis, you can go pick up a racket, take a lesson, and understand how much talent and skill it takes to be as good as the top pros. Same with golf: pick up a club. But not many can go out and get in a race car and experience a drive at over 200 miles an hour.": "Mario",
  "Any writer who gives a reader a pleasurable experience is doing every other writer a favor because it will make the reader want to read other books. I am all for it.": "S.",

  "Happiness isn't something you experience it's something you remember. ": "Oscar",
  "I have found life an enjoyable, enchanting, active, and sometime terrifying experience, and I've enjoyed it completely. A lament in one ear, maybe, but always a song in the other.": "Sean",
  "Anybody who has gone through a life-changing experience will tell you there is a different understanding of what is real and what is important, and when you are going through different moments, you can reflect and go, 'I have been through worse.'": "Delta",
  "Playing a bad guy is always a freeing experience, because you don't have the same envelope of restrictions as you have playing a good guy. Good guys restrain themselves; they kind of have their moral fiber cut out for them in varying degrees.": "John",
  "To be happy when you are travelling, you need to be happy inside before you leave. A positive frame of mind will definitely enhance your travelling experience. If I'm not in a positive frame of mind then the whole thing definitely becomes more of a challenge for me.": "Andrea",
  "I've had a wonderful experience here at Penn State.": "Joe",
  "I played for Santos at 16, and we had an excellent team, so it helped a lot. And then I played for Brazil at the Maracana against Argentina. So I get more experience. This was one year before the World Cup, and it made a lot of difference.": "Pele",
  "A good memory is surely a compost heap that converts experience to wisdom, creativity, or dottiness; not that these things are of much earthly value, but at least they may keep you amused when the world is keeping you locked away or shutting you out.": "Michael",
  "Racism is a physical experience.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "Proper training and federal supervision in state-federal partnerships are essential to both assuring constitutional rights and enforcing our immigration laws. Our Founding Fathers' concept of federalism does not prohibit such cooperation, and we have learned from experience that joint efforts work best.": "Asa",
  "Donald Trump is a phenomenon that foreign countries haven't seen. So it is a shocking experience to them that he came in to office.": "Henry",
  "Ages of experience have taught humanity that the commitment of a husband and wife to love and to serve one another promotes the welfare of children and the stability of society.": "Jack",
  "It's more fun to experience things when you don't know what's going to happen.": "Louis",

  "Our wisdom comes from our experience, and our experience comes from our foolishness.": "Sacha",
  "I'm a culture vulture, and I just want to experience it all.": "Debbie",
  "Truth be told, I'm not an easy man. I can be an entertaining one, though it's been my experience that most people don't want to be entertained. They want to be comforted.": "Richard",
  "Every experience, good or bad, is a priceless collector's item.": "Isaac",
  "If you're lucky enough to experience love, what you find is that it can sustain you through the most difficult times.": "Denise",
  "I just feel like if I start opening the door to talking about my university experience, then people just kind of... own everything. There was a lot of stuff a couple of years ago saying that I was bullied at Brown and awful things like that, none of which were true.": "Emma",
  "I try to make the readers feel they've lived the events of the book. Just as you grieve if a friend is killed, you should grieve if a fictional character is killed. You should care. If somebody dies and you just go get more popcorn, it's a superficial experience isn't it?": "George",
  "A woman experiencing an unplanned pregnancy also deserves to experience unplanned joy.": "Patricia",
  "I feel that when I began writing, I had a need to know more about the play before I got into it. I think that's the way I was thinking. But my actual experience is that the best way to find out what the structure is, is by writing the play out laterally. You just have got to be brave enough to start without knowing where you are going.": "Tom",
  "I've been singing about love a long time now, because my kind of love carries a different flavor. My lyrics are not so outrageous as some. You have to think about a lot of different things. You get more mature with what you do - more experience, more capable, you know, the older you get.": "Burning",
  "Such is my experience - not that I ever mourned the loss of a child, but that I consider myself as lost!": "Deborah",
  "The city - as the theater of experience, the refuge, the hiding place - has, in turn, been replaced by an abstraction, the fast lane. In the fast lane, the passive observer reduces everything - streets, people, rock lyrics, headlines - to landscape. Every night holds magical promises of renewal. But burnout is inevitable, like some law of physics.": "Darryl",
  "Another way of judging the value of a prophet's religious experience, therefore, would be to examine the type of manhood that he has created, and the cultural world that has sprung out of the spirit of his message.": "Muhammad",
  "The new spirituality is that it will produce an experience in human encounters in which we become a living demonstration of the basic spiritual teaching 'We are all one.'": "Neale",
  "It was one of the most exciting, perfect evenings of my life, my solo debut at Carnegie Hall. And knowing we were all there to raise money for Gay Men's Health Crisis made the evening an extraordinary experience.": "Bernadette",
  "We were a very small circle of writers. Everybody brought to the table their own life experience.": "Howie",
  "Whatever you dwell on in the conscious grows in your experience.": "Brian",
  "No one intuitively understands quantum mechanics because all of our experience involves a world of classical phenomena where, for example, a baseball thrown from pitcher to catcher seems to take just one path, the one described by Newton's laws of motion. Yet at a microscopic level, the universe behaves quite differently.": "Lawrence",
  "Depression, if it's an unconsciously elected experience, is a luxury.": "Jesse",
  "As I get older, I want to draw on my experience to make roles better. I see that in the older women who inspire me - their experience makes them better.": "Anne-Marie",
  "In a person who is open to experience each stimulus is freely relayed through the nervous system, without being distorted by any process of defensiveness.": "Carl",
  "The American experience influenced my understanding of individuality, basic human rights, freedom of expression and the rights and responsibilities of citizens.": "Ai",
  "Each solstice is a domain of experience unto itself. At the Summer Solstice, all is green and growing, potential coming into being, the miracle of manifestation painted large on the canvas of awareness. At the Winter Solstice, the wind is cold, trees are bare and all lies in stillness beneath blankets of snow.": "Gary",
  "Just as there is no substitute for original works of art, there is no substitute for the world of direct sensual experience.": "Paul",
  "Experience keeps a dear school, but fools will learn in no other.": "Benjamin",
  "All adventure is now reactionary.": "William",
  "The trouble with travelling back later on is that you can never repeat the same experience.": "Michael",
  "The French are true romantics. They feel the only difference between a man of forty and one of seventy is thirty years of experience.": "Maurice",
  "Experience teaches you that the man who looks you straight in the eye, particularly if he adds a firm handshake, is hiding something.": "Clifton",
  "Poetry, I think, intensifies the reader's experience. If it's a humorous facet of the story, poetry makes it more exuberant. If it's a sad facet, poetry can make it more poignant.": "Vikram",
  "Sometimes, when I hear people without experience of addiction blame addicts for their behaviour, I feel like saying to them: 'You simply don't understand - how can a child be held responsible for doing such a dreadful thing to himself?' But then again, at other times I have to acknowledge: it was done wilfully.": "Will",
  "You don't buy experience at the pharmacy. You acquire it through games over time. Every player must go through that, but when the federation hired me, they told me they wanted new players and young players who will prepare for the future.": "Agustin",
  "Getting on stage and performing and standing under lights is such an unsettling experience - in a good and bad way - but it's the only place I can go to feel comfortable.": "Matt",
  "I knew so many gangsters, and I call on that experience with them for characters.": "Frank",
  "God cannot be realized through the intellect. Intellect can lead one to a certain extent and no further. It is a matter of faith and experience derived from that faith.": "Mahatma",
  "Job seekers light up when they find The Muse - we're a breath of fresh air in a stale, musty world. Our user experience focuses first and foremost on the individual, on providing them information - from content to company profiles - to make the most pressing professional decisions in their lives.": "Kathryn",
  "The monsters of our childhood do not fade away, neither are they ever wholly monstrous. But neither, in my experience, do we ever reach a plane of detachment regarding our parents, however wise and old we may become. To pretend otherwise is to cheat.": "John",
  "The dictum that truth always triumphs over persecution is one of the pleasant falsehoods which men repeat after one another till they pass into commonplaces, but which all experience refutes.": "John",
  "Language fits over experience like a straight-jacket.": "William",
  "It's queer how ready people always are with advice in any real or imaginary emergency, and no matter how many times experience has shown them to be wrong, they continue to set forth their opinions, as if they had received them from the Almighty!": "Anne",
  "Many of the insights of the saint stem from their experience as sinners.": "Eric",
  "A leader who confines his role to his people's experience dooms himself to stagnation a leader who outstrips his people's experience runs the risk of not being understood. ": "Henry",
  "I firmly believe that all human beings have access to extraordinary energies and powers. Judging from accounts of mystical experience, heightened creativity, or exceptional performance by athletes and artists, we harbor a greater life than we know.": "Jean",
  "See, when I paint, it is an experience that, at its best, is transcending reality.": "Keith",
  "For most entertainers, there is a single experience, one defining moment, when confidence replaces the self-doubt that most of us wrestle with.": "Charley",
  "As for the forces, electromagnetism and gravity we experience in everyday life. But the weak and strong forces are beyond our ordinary experience. So in physics, lots of the basic building blocks take 20th- or perhaps 21st-century equipment to explore.": "Edward",
  "Mississippi Mermaid was a very special experience because we only had the dialogues for the scenes we were shooting the night before.": "Catherine",
  "If a movie is really working, you forget for two hours your Social Security number and where your car is parked. You are having a vicarious experience. You are identifying, in one way or another, with the people on the screen.": "Roger",
  "The crucial question one comes back to is the examination; without that experience is meaningless. And I think it's true that society is becoming more and more passive, less and less fired up with enthusiasm, in many spheres.": "Peter",
  "Putting is like wisdom - partly a natural gift and partly the accumulation of experience.": "Arnold",
  "You have to experience life, make observations, and ask questions.": "Mos",
  "I think you want to try every sport possible just to experience life.": "Jose",
  "I want to experience that massive adrenalin rush when you step into a new stadium, all the more so when that Olympic Stadium is packed full of people waving British flags.": "Jessica",
  "Artists need some kind of stimulating experience a lot of times, which crystallizes when you sing about it or paint it or sculpt it. You literally mold the experience the way you want. It's therapy.": "Erykah",
  "Life is full of change and uncertainty. We know this. We experience it on a daily basis.": "Carre",
  "After having my baby I felt like I'd been introduced to my life, I slowed down, I paid more attention to simple things, I addressed a few issues in my own life, I even got married, I looked at what was important and what wasn't, and so I used that experience for inspiration.": "Cecelia",
  "Drama school is a pretty intense experience, and I think it changes who you are.": "David",
  "There's no experience like going down an empty freeway toward a hurricane and then looking in the opposite lane and seeing bumper-to-bumper traffic, people fleeing that scene. Or going to a toxic spill and seeing people go the other way. You talk yourself into thinking you're invincible in order to do that.": "Lester",
  "To wear a floral shirt is an experience.": "Brian",
  "Individual potential of life is cosmic potential. Individual is divine deep inside. Transcendental experience awakens that divinity in man. And when you kill a man you deprive him of that birthright of it.": "Maharishi",
  "As an artist, the more experience, the better the creation. I'm a very positive person.": "Psy",
  "Real misanthropes are not found in solitude, but in the world; since it is experience of life, and not philosophy, which produces real hatred of mankind.": "Giacomo",
  "To me, the job of the artist is to provide a useful and intelligent vocabulary for the world to be able to articulate feelings they experience everyday, and otherwise wouldn't have the means to express in a meaningful and useful way.": "Mos",
  "I'm a method writer. In order to write about the emotion, I have to experience it. I get physically tired and exhausted, devoting hours and hours and hours to it.": "Sherman",
  "Without in any way minimising the economic and psychological blow that people experience when they lose their jobs, the unemployed in affluent countries still have a safety net, in the form of social security payments, and usually free healthcare and free education for their children. They also have sanitation and safe drinking water.": "Peter",
  "Stress is never a given. There are people who get divorced amicably. There are people who pack up and move with no emotional toll. There is no stressor 'out there' in the world. We experience stress - or we don't - depending on what we believe.": "Andrew",
  "As with real reading, the ability to comprehend subtlety and complexity comes only with time and a lot of experience. If you don't adequately acquire those skills, moving out into the real world of real people can actually become quite scary.": "Jeffrey",
  "Most of us experience a life full of wonderful moments and difficult moments. But for many of us, even when we are most joyful, there is fear behind our joy.": "Thich",
  "What I've learned from my own journey, and from my family's experience with cancer, is how important it is to stay positive and move forward. Not every day is going to be perfect; that's life. But staying positive is going to get you to the next day.": "Bonnie",

  "There are some hurts that we experience that can be forgiven but we won't forget them.": "Joyce",

  "In my experience, growing up in Brooklyn and all that, the real tough guys didn't act tough. They didn't talk tough. They were tough, you know? I think about these politicians who try to pose as tough guys - it makes me laugh.": "Pete",
  "To use the same words is not a sufficient guarantee of understanding one must use the same words for the same genus of inward experience ultimately one must have one's experiences in common. ": "Friedrich",

  "Play is a uniquely adaptive act, not subordinate to some other adaptive act, but with a special function of its own in human experience.": "Johan",
  "It's my experience that you really can't lose when you try the truth.": "Sharon",
  "I probably hold the distinction of being one movie star who, by all laws of logic, should never have made it. At each stage of my career, I lacked the experience.": "Audrey",
  "The essence of life is finding something you really love and then making the daily experience worthwhile.": "Denis",
  "Proverbs are short sentences drawn from long experience.": "Miguel",
  "Fame will go by and, so long, I've had you, fame. If it goes by, I've always known it was fickle. So at least it's something I experience, but that's not where I live.": "Marilyn",

  "Any experience can be transformed into something of value.": "Vash",
  "Where you are in consciousness has everything to do with what you see in experience.": "Eric",

  "My view on issues is based on common sense, and my experience as a mother of four children, as a sole parent, and as a businesswoman running a fish and chip shop.": "Pauline",
  "The underlying message of the Lancet article is that if you want to understand aggressive behaviour in children, look to the social and emotional environment in which they are growing up, and the values they bring to the viewing experience.": "Hugh",
  "The striking thing about the Precious Blood is the bond it establishes between love and suffering in our experience, a bond that has become so close that we have come to think of suffering accepted with joy as the most authentic sign of love with any depth at all.": "Gabriel",
  "All historical experience demonstrates the following: Our earth cannot be changed unless in the not too distant future an alteration in the consciousness of individuals is achieved.": "Hans",
  "People ask if I regret not winning a Stanley Cup, but winning the series against the Soviet Union was the best. It was the greatest experience of my hockey career by far.": "Marcel",

  "I rode on a float in one of the parades in Mississippi. It's an experience.": "Elliott",
  "You're creating an intimacy that everybody feels, that it's their experience, not yours. I'll never introduce a song and say, now this song is about 'my' broken heart.": "Diana",
  "We want people to experience art and think about it. The art reflects our time, it is about our culture.": "David",
  "If you need to take a step back from day-to-day operations and plot out the long-term direction of your user experience strategy, consultants can give you a perspective you can't get on your own.": "Jesse",

  "The things that concern us during the day are going to influence what we experience during the night.": "Henry",
  "It was less a literary thing than a linguistic, philosophical preoccupation... discovering how far you can go with language to create immediate, elementary experience.": "Robert",
  "The course of the flight up and down was exceedingly erratic, partly due to the irregularity of the air, and partly to lack of experience in handling this machine. The control of the front rudder was difficult on account of its being balanced too near the center.": "Orville",
  "Happy Days was a wonderful, wonderful experience and I would not have traded it for the world.": "Marion",
  "I would wish for any one of my colleagues to have the experience of working with Martin Scorsese once in their lifetime.": "Daniel",
  "The deaf community is in a favorable position because they have a national theatre and training groups of their own to get them started. Deaf actors have often acquired very valuable skills and experience before they get their break.": "Richard",
  "But constant experience shows us that every man invested with power is apt to abuse it, and to carry his authority as far as it will go.": "Charles",
  "The experience of testifying and the aftermath have changed my life.": "Anita",
  "I think a painting should include more experience than simply intended statement.": "Jasper",
  "If someone is making a judgment when they don't have firsthand experience, it's intolerant. How can you make a judgment on something you don't know about?": "Beck",
  "I have relationships with people I'm working with, based on our combined interest. It doesn't make the relationship any less sincere, but it does give it a focus that may not last beyond the experience.": "Harrison",
  "Each of us brings to our job, whatever it is, our lifetime of experience and our values.": "Sandra",
  "Great actors try to dismiss all ideas from their conscious mind in order to provide an experience that is real.": "Mark",
  "On the one hand, we'll never experience childbirth. On the other hand, we can open all our own jars.": "Bruce",
  "Work is a substitute religious experience for many workaholics.": "Mary",
  "Experience is the cane of the blind.": "Jacques",
  "It took me years to understand that words are often as important as experience, because words make experience last.": "William",
  "Social psychology is especially interested in the effect which the social group has in the determination of the experience and conduct of the individual member.": "George",
  "For me, the desire exists less to get myself a degree than to just go and have the whole college experience, and throw myself into the brain pool and see if I can swim.": "Joshua",
  "Existence itself does not feel horrible; it feels like an ecstasy, rather, which we have only to be still to experience.": "John",
  "Writing a novel is a terrible experience, during which the hair often falls out and the teeth decay.": "Flannery",
  "We come altogether fresh and raw into the several stages of life, and often find ourselves without experience, despite our years.": "Francois",
  "The sole substitute for an experience which we have not ourselves lived through is art and literature.": "Aleksandr",
  "The impulse to dream was slowly beaten out of me by experience. Now it surged up again and I hungered for books, new ways of looking and seeing.": "Richard",
  "I was emotionally and physically punched in the stomach. This is not a place where you go and deliver the lines and then you come back. It's kind of a life-changing experience. But it can't get better than this for any actor - this is like an opera.": "Javier",
  "I have the ordinary experience of being anonymous when I'm in an airplane talking to air-traffic control, and they don't know who they're talking to. I have a lot of common experiences.": "Harrison",
  "The making of 'Naked' was an absolutely phenomenal, mind-bending experience. That film was life-changing and put my career onto a whole different level.": "David",
  "The mind when it has an old experience will add that data into its current experience, and it keeps coming up with wrong answers.": "L.",
  "During the whole 'Jeopardy' experience, I felt like I was living a bit of a double life, I would be secretly flying out to L.A. to tape new shows, hoping that none of my coworkers would notice the absence and figure out what was going on. 'Jeopardy' tries very hard to keep their secrets.": "Ken",
  "When I'm writing, I'm trying to immerse myself in the chaos of an emotional experience, rather than separate myself from it and look back at it from a distance with clarity and tell it as a story. Because that's how life is lived, you know?": "Charlie",
  "I'm interested in authentic experience and the essence of that creative place, and where those myths begin and where they become real on any level.": "Chris",
  "The counterculture has nothing to do with Dolce & Gabbana having a 'Hippy Summer' or something. Street kids, and kids who want to live in any sort of counter-cultural experience other than what's being presented by the mainstream media or political climate, or 'normal' cultural climate, are never going to look like that.": "Chris",
  "The things I was allowed to experience, the people I was able to call friends, teammates, mentors, coaches and opponents, the travel, all of it, are far more than anything I ever thought possible in my lifetime.": "Curt",
  "In my experience lust only ever leads to misery. All that suspicion and jealousy and anguish it unleashes. I don't want those things in my life.": "Chrissie",
  "Games have grown and developed from this limited in-the-box experience to something that's everywhere now. Interactive content is all around us, networked, ready. This is something I've been hoping for throughout my career.": "Shigeru",
  "I write out of my intellectual experience.": "Tom",
  "I definitely feel more complete than before. There's a void you have when you don't feel you've found the other part of who you are, so I'm in a different place now and that's nice to experience.": "Mariah",
  "I don't believe that the American dream should be reserved for those who are born into the elite or somehow have been given an advantage over others. My growing-up experience is probably the most important thing that guides my priorities and my work today.": "Ken",
  "Find what's hot, find what's just opened and then look for the worst review of the week. There is so much to learn from watching a restaurant getting absolutely panned and having a bad experience. Go and see it for yourself.": "Gordon",
  "Going out and playing football or baseball with the boys, when I was a tomboy, was a great way to learn about winning and losing, and most girls didn't have that experience.": "Hillary",
  "I've realized that I love all forms of music and get excited when any artist goes crazy and creates something that is an experience.": "Tom",
  "How do people relate to movies now, when they're on portable devices or streaming them? It's not as much about going to the movies. That experience has changed.": "Keanu",
  "My worst hair experience was when I was trying to relax my hair and my grandmother did it. It went all straight and I looked like a black Bee Gee.": "Jamie",
  "It has been the experience of a lifetime to work with Catherine Middleton to create her wedding dress, and I have enjoyed every moment of it. It was such an incredible honor to be asked, and I am so proud of what we and the Alexander McQueen team have created.": "Sarah",
  "You can rest a lot in an hour or have a whole day and not do it properly. One way I get a quality recharge is to connect with nature. To experience something that's bigger than me.": "Lili",
  "I like to investigate all different kinds of people, I guess, and find out what makes them who they are, and try to be honest in the portrayal, and truthful, and find out how to understand that person, how to communicate that person's experience.": "Jennifer",
  "I got the travel bug when I was quite young. My parents took me and my sisters out of school and we travelled all over Europe. It was an eye-opening experience and, although I love Norway, I also enjoy visiting new countries. I don't get homesick.": "Magnus",
  "Life is a very emotional experience.": "Tony",
  "I don't think I believe in ghosts, per se. But, my nearest experience was when I went on a weekend away and was in a bar in England, years ago, with an ex-girlfriend. I heard this scratching. I was about to go to bed and I was thinking, 'It's an old ghost.' I could hear this noise, but I couldn't work out where it was coming from.": "Theo",
  "How much do you as a consumer value a positive experience with a brand or its customer service department? How willing are you to share that with your friends? How inclined are you to let that person know that you're interaction with them was positive?": "Simon",
  "On the television planet, where men make up the tribe, the law of the caveman rules. So, for a woman coming from another world, without experience or cunning, to succeed gradually in gaining control over what is to be taped, what goes out over the air, what is said without censorship, is an epic feat.": "Cristina",
  "I just think music is so intrinsically linked with images in the culture that we live in that you'll be hard-pressed to have an experience with the music without a preconceived notion.": "Esperanza",
  "I like big casts. The experience of working together, that human contact - those are my roots, professionally.": "Chris",
  "In real life we don't know what's going to happen next. So how can you be that way on a stage? Being alive to the possibility of not knowing exactly how everything is going to happen next - if you can find places to have that happen onstage, it can resonate with an experience of living.": "Sam",
  "I hooked up with director Jacques Audiard for this film called 'Rust & Bone' with Marion Cotillard. I loved that experience so much I'm truly sad that it's over!": "Matthias",
  "From my experience, meditating can bring up the most stressful thoughts.": "Mike",
  "Music is, of course, a universal emotional experience, cutting across cultures and languages. I studied piano for ten years as a child and consider that experience one of the most valuable in my life.": "Alan",
  "37 is a lumpy number, a bit like porridge. Six is very small and dark and cold, and whenever I was little trying to understand what sadness is I would imagine myself inside a number six and having that experience of cold and darkness. Similarly, number four is a shy number.": "Daniel",
  "I think about things like the fact that nobody knows what time is. Time is what? Nobody can describe it, even physics or math or anything else. But it is what we continuously experience. It's the state of our unfolding, in a way, and in that sense that the continuous reopening of reality is what I think of as, perhaps, a worldview.": "Marilynne",
  "My prayer became 'May I find peace... May I love this life no matter what.' I was seeking an inner refuge, an experience of presence and wholeness that could carry me through whatever losses might come.": "Tara",
  "We are mindful of desire when we experience it with an embodied awareness, recognizing the sensations and thoughts of wanting as arising and passing phenomena. While this isn't easy, as we cultivate the clear seeing and compassion of Radical Acceptance, we discover we can open fully to this natural force, and remain free in its midst.": "Tara",
  "It's really interesting to me how all of us can experience the exact same event, and yet come away with wildly disparate interpretations of what happened. We each have totally different ideas of what was said, what was intended, and what really took place.": "Marya",
  "The word that I constantly hear out of women is 'fear.' It's almost like a background melody. Women have excellent degrees and experience, but we are afraid we aren't good enough because we have such high expectations.": "Mireille",
  "The thing about being an actor is that as we get older, there are more and more characters to explore and, in general, they get more complicated, so you get to bring all your crazy life experience to the table.": "Victoria",
  "You can write about other people and their ideas and life without having lived it, but even your perception of that is going to be colored by what you know and what you experience. And this is undeniable.": "James",
  "I don't believe there's any such thing as objective reality. It's only reality as we experience it.": "James",
  "Certainly all historical experience confirms the truth - that man would not have attained the possible unless time and again he had reached out for the impossible.": "Max",
  "One has to go beyond the mind to experience the spiritual bliss of desirelessness.": "Meher",
  "Places that have experienced great defeat experience a kind of rebirth, which I think America has to do - unless we want to get more decrepit. I don't think we have to destroy the place totally.": "Rufus",
  "I always thought I'd make a good parent, but I was single and led a solitary life for many, many years. Then I met David, and he had experience with kids and wanted to have a family, too.": "Neil",
  "I'm very type-A, and many things in my life are about control and domination, but eating should be a submissive experience, where you let down your guard and enjoy the ride.": "Anthony",
  "The day I decided I didn't want to be a 19th-Century European curator, I knew I would never have the experience of people coming and going 'ooh' and 'aah,' the way they do around the Monets. It just doesn't happen.": "Thelma",
  "On the intimate level, anyone who has loved a companion animal knows the uniquely wonderful experience these 'other nations' provide, and their important presence in our shared lives. In their very local way they show us the global truth of our real wealth, our biodiversity.": "April",
  "I can tell you from experience that God's help and presence in our lives is vital. He is the Author of all true success and everything that is good-without Him, we can do nothing of true value.": "Joyce",
  "Harvard was the most intimidating experience. I felt so out of my league there.": "Wendy",
  "I deepen my experience of God through prayer, meditation, and forgiveness.": "Marianne",
  "The experience of God, or in any case the possibility of experiencing God, is innate.": "Alice",
  "Bad experience is a school that only fools keep going to.": "Ezra",
  "I designed 'Buffy' to be an icon, to be an emotional experience, to be loved in a way that other shows can't be loved. Because it's about adolescence, which is the most important thing people go through in their development, becoming an adult.": "Joss",
  "Lying in bed would be an altogether perfect and supreme experience if only one had a colored pencil long enough to draw on the ceiling.": "Gilbert",
  "The physical world, including our bodies, is a response of the observer. We create our bodies as we create the experience of our world.": "Deepak",
  "Experience - the wisdom that enables us to recognise in an undesirable old acquaintance the folly that we have already embraced.": "Ambrose",
  "More people should read books. It's the most concentrated experience you can have.": "Vivienne",
  "Two things control men's nature, instinct and experience.": "Blaise",
  "I left Jamaica for a while, because as an artist I need to experience different things, see the world, have different energies. Living in one place is not good for me.": "Ziggy",
  "I don't go to shows because I just want to listen to the music performed live. I want to get to know the person who's performing it. Or I want to, like, take away a sense that I had an experience that nobody else is going to have again, or a unique experience for that moment.": "Sia",
  "Optimism with some experience behind it is much more energizing than plain old experience with a certain degree of cynicism.": "Twyla",
  "Anyone who teaches knows that you don't really experience a text until you've taught it, in loving detail, with an intelligent and responsive class.": "Joyce",
  "Probably the first time I left Italy was to travel by train to Lourdes. I went with my mother and my grandmother - who was a very religious person - so it was a pilgrimage of sorts. I remember it as a very intense, but beautiful experience.": "Andrea",
  "The word experience is like a shrapnel shell, and bursts into a thousand meanings.": "George",
  "The experience of democracy is like the experience of life itself-always changing, infinite in its variety, sometimes turbulent and all the more valuable for having been tested by adversity.": "Jimmy",
  "The head learns new things, but the heart forever practices old experiences.": "Henry",
  "Obviously an actor draws on his own experience.": "Christopher",
  "Suffering is but another name for the teaching of experience, which is the parent of instruction and the schoolmaster of life.": "Horace",
  "Parents, it seems, have an almost Olympian persistence when it comes to suggesting more secure and lucrative lines of work for their children who have the notion that writing is an actual profession. I say this from experience.": "Susan",
  "All of the legal defense funds out there, they're looking for people out there with court of appeals experience, because court of appeals is where policy is made. And I know, I know this is on tape and I should never say that because we don't make law, I know. I know.": "Sonia",
  "I've been lucky enough - well, maybe unlucky enough - to have had a lot of friends who have had their ups and downs. And for an actor, that's good. Life experience in any regard is good. So I've seen a lot and I've had my own experiences.": "Chris",
  "I go by instinct - I don't worry about experience.": "Barbra",
  "I do write a lot from personal experience, but I also embellish a bit.": "Miranda",
  "For me, titles are either a natural two-second experience or stressful enough to give you an ulcer. If they don't pop out perfect on the first try, they can be really hard to repair. Or, worse, if the author thinks they pop out perfect, but the publishing house does not agree, it's difficult to shift gears. And then? Then you go insane.": "Sloane",
  "Every experience makes you a man.": "Eric",
  "There is nothing so easy to learn as experience and nothing so hard to apply.": "Josh",
  "What a blessing that God allows a life to come through your body, and then allows you to place that body in a body bag and take it out. I had to say that there's a magnificent something that God has for me to do, to give me that level of completion. That level of experience. It's unspeakable.": "Iyanla",
  "Everyone has something that blocks us from the full experience and expression of our nobility.": "Iyanla",
  "I want to be able to experience everything. I want to experience being a husband, experience being a father, experience, maybe, hopefully, someday being a grandfather, and all those things. I want that experience. When I die, I want to be exhausted.": "Bryan",
  "Women love working together. That's my experience anyway.": "Shirley",
  "When a novel has 200,000 words, then it is possible for the reader to experience 200,000 delights, and to turn back to the first page of the book and experience them all over again, perhaps more intensely.": "Jane",
  "What is the good of drawing conclusions from experience? I don't deny we sometimes draw the right conclusions, but don't we just as often draw the wrong ones?": "Georg",
  "The first of the four noble truths of Buddhism, that there is suffering in life, was enormously important to me. No one had ever said it out loud. That had been my experience, of course, but no one had ever talked about it. I didn't know what to do with all the fear and emotions within, and here was the Buddha saying this truth right out loud.": "Sharon",
  "A lot of why I do something is just the novelty of the experience.": "Edward",
  "A lot of parents today are terrified that something they say to their children might make them 'feel bad.' But, hey, if they've done something wrong, they should feel bad. Kids with a sense of responsibility, not entitlement, who know when to experience gratitude and humility, will be better at navigating the social shoals of college.": "Amy",
  "I didn't fully realize it at the time, but the goal of my life was profoundly molded by this experience - to help produce, in the next generation, more Mother Teresas and less Hitlers.": "Elisabeth",
  "To most men experience is like the stern lights of a ship, which illuminate only the track it has passed.": "Samuel",
  "When I'm home on a break, I lock myself in my room and play guitar. After two or three hours, I start getting into this total meditation. It's a feeling few people experience, and that's usually when I come up with weird stuff. It just flows. I can't force myself. I don't sit down and say I've got to practice.": "Eddie",
  "We have that illusion that we are 'deciding' what to make a character do, in order to 'convey our message' or something like that. But, at least in my experience, you are often more like a river-rafting guide who's been paid a bonus to purposely steer your clients into the roughest possible water.": "George",
  "Taste every fruit of every tree in the garden at least once. It is an insult to creation not to experience it fully. Temperance is wickedness.": "Stephen",
  "Making movies is a very different experience in a lot of ways. It's difficult when you're used to owning the copyright and having a landlord's possessory rights - I rent my plays to the companies that do them and, if I'm upset, I can pull the play. But the only two directors I've worked with are pretty great.": "Tony",
  "There's a beauty to wisdom and experience that cannot be faked. It's impossible to be mature without having lived.": "Amy",
  "I don't care how smart a kid you are. The only way you learn what's not right is from experience.": "Cameron",
  "One of the things I'm trying to do over and over again in my books is create new mythologies, create new ways to understand the complexity of the world. I think what mythology does is impress upon chaotic experience the patterns, hierarchies and shapes which allow us to interpret the chaos and make fresh sense of it.": "Clive",
  "I must take issue with the term 'a mere child', for it has been my invariable experience that the company of a mere child is infinitely preferable to that of a mere adult.": "Fran",
  "I think I can make an entirely new game experience, and if I can't do it, some other game designer will.": "Shigeru",
  "You experience your soul each time you sense yourself as more than a mind and body, your life as meaningful, or you feel that you have gifts to give and you long to give them.": "Gary",
  "The success of any stand-up act comes out of life experience.": "Howie",
  "Tragedy makes you grow up.": "Jane",
  "You know, artists don't really have all that much experience of life. We make a huge amount out of the small experience that we do have.": "John",
  "I have had a lot of experience in broadcasting.": "Jimmy",
  "Experiences are savings which a miser puts aside. Wisdom is an inheritance which a wastrel cannot exhaust.": "Karl",
  "For some young people, their first experience ever hearing punk rock music was playing the Green Bay Packers on 'Madden'.": "Billie",
  "My favorite animal to hunt is probably elk. There's nothing like the sound of a bugling bull splitting the cold air at first light. And that smell is unmistakable. Once you experience their musk in the wild there's no going back! A close second would be a varmint hunt.": "Chris",
  "In fact the experience at Oxford has really helped me later in life.": "Imran",
  "When my father died, I had a real experience with Christ, a real conversion with Christ and I had it in a Oneness church.": "T.",
  "Individuals with kidney disease who are able to obtain treatment early experience a higher quality of life and are able to maintain more of their day-to-day activities, including keeping their jobs.": "Xavier",
  "As entrepreneurs, we often get pressured into hiring an industry executive. While it's good to hire people with experience, it can also be a stumbling block because they think about the business the same way everyone else does.": "Blake",
  "The main thing experience has taught me is that one has to sort of hone their relationship to time, you know.": "John",
  "My experience of life is that it's very fragmented; certain kinds of things happen, and in another place, a different kind of thing occurs. I would like my work to have some vivid indication of those differences.": "Jasper",
  "So if I have two pieces of cake, do I have twice as good an experience as the first piece of cake? One of the things I've found in life is that the first piece of cake is the best.": "David",
  "If you want to write an angry e-mail, write it but don't send it. It's based on my experience that whenever I have acted out in some manner, I have always regretted it.": "Tim",
  "You can't be minimalist as a director until you have acquired the experience and confidence to say no.": "Richard",
  "Nothing which has entered into our experience is ever lost.": "William",
  "Experience teaches us to be most on our guard to protect liberty when the government's purposes are beneficent.": "Louis",
  "It is very, very difficult for a playwright to write a scene in which a young man has his first deep experience of sex with a girl whom he found immensely attractive, is fully satisfied by this event and gets up and blinds a lot of horses.": "Peter",
  "My best travelling experience lasted several years: between 1971 and 1974 when I bummed around the East. All I had with me was a cooking pot, a stove, a map and blankets and a couple of dhotis.": "Antony",
  "Well, the hardest thing to do, as we know from our own experience on 9/11 is protect everything all the time.": "John",
  "For me, just being how old I am, I know I don't want to be a single mom. I really would rather make it a two-person job. But I've also come to terms with not being a mother at all. I'm actually really good with either direction that my life can take as being a valid experience.": "Lisa",
  "In the Russian experience, although the Russian state is oppressive, it is their state, it is part of their fabric, and so the relation between Russian citizens and their state is complicated.": "Ryszard",
  "It's like a rugby team. If you're picking for the World Cup final, you're picking experience with youth. Everything is better off having that balance and that mix. I think that, especially, goes for the monarchy as well.": "Prince",
  "On top of my to-do list in preparing for Beijing is 'On China' by Henry Kissinger, who has had firsthand experience with every top Chinese leader since Mao, so his insights are valuable and his access is perhaps unrivaled.": "Gary",
  "We see and hear and otherwise experience very largely as we do because the language habits of our community predispose certain choices of interpretation.": "Edward",
  "I think we are a product of all our experiences.": "Sanford",
  "Truly we have had enough experience with sufferance and protection which could be revoked at will. Consequently, the only reasonable Course of action is to work for publicly legalized guarantees.": "Theodor",
  "But today we become aware of other readings of the human experience very quickly because of the media and the speed with which people travel the planet.": "Chaim",
  "The home viewing experience is slightly different and there's room for these kinds of extra excursions.": "Ivan",
  "You don't cheat anybody out of their experience, whatever it is.": "Andre",
  "I'm really passionate about pantomime because it is often the first introduction for a child to theatre, and if that child has a great experience at a pantomime they will continue to come year after year.": "John",
  "If you believe your catcher is intelligent and you know that he has considerable experience, it is a good thing to leave the game almost entirely in his hands.": "Bob",
  "I think driving in New York is a great experience. A lot more racing techniques go into it than anyplace else I've ever driven. There basically are no lanes.": "Jeff",
  "Not the fruit of experience, but experience itself, is the end.": "Walter",
  "At first sight experience seems to bury us under a flood of external objects, pressing upon us with a sharp and importunate reality, calling us out of ourselves in a thousand forms of action.": "Walter",
  "Everything is discursive opinion instead of direct experience.": "A.",
  "It's such a pleasurable experience to look back, and all of the fun I had just comes rushing back.": "Jenna",
  "The singular point of beautiful objects, and people, is that they are experienced not as parts, or ratios between cheekbones and chin, but as wholes. The experience of beauty is a perception, but it is one that mixes up various other sensations and makes them converge in a particular way.": "Charles",
  "That this individual life of all of us is not something limited in its temporal expression to the life that now we experience, follows from the very fact that here nothing final or individual is found expressed.": "Josiah",
  "When I come off the bench, I'm looking to add energy, and then I play defense and rebound. Also, at the end of the game, I have the experience to go out there and help us win.": "Sue",
  "I've definitely had the experience where I was pursuing someone for a long time that I just obviously did not connect with, so I was always, kind of altering myself for her, But then you realize it's just not worth it. What's the point?": "Logan",
  "To the artist is sometimes granted a sudden, transient insight which serves in this matter for experience. A flash, and where previously the brain held a dead fact, the soul grasps a living truth! At moments we are all artists.": "Arnold",
  "I try and create for the audience something that relates to real-life experience.": "Mike",
  "But back to your question, it was a wonderful experience with the Art Ensemble, and I keep in contact and sort of follow what's going on, but it was also very important to make this step, you may say this leap of faith.": "Joseph",
  "Color is an intense experience on its own.": "Jim",
  "Technology... the knack of so arranging the world that we don't have to experience it.": "Max",
  "The printed page conveys information and commitment, and requires active involvement. Television conveys emotion and experience, and it's very limited in what it can do logically. It's an existential experience - there and then gone.": "Bill",
  "As is known, it is in the realm of experience inaugurated by psychoanalysis that we may grasp along what imaginary lines the human organism, in the most intimate recesses of its being, manifests its capture in a symbolic dimension.": "Jacques",
  "I think President Obama wanted to have the right fit for his different cabinet positions, and I believe that experience is what mattered most to him. In my case, I have been working to improve the overall quality of life for working families for most of my adult life, and I think that experience resonated with the president.": "Hilda",
  "Our specious present as such is very short. We do, however, experience passing events; part of the process of the passage of events is directly there in our experience, including some of the past and some of the future.": "George",
  "I think I draw most inspiration from writers like Richelle Mead and filmmakers like John Hughes. They both really understand the experience of being a teenager and how insistent and intense everything feels, but they're also smart, savvy, and fun.": "Amanda",
  "Finishing books - and leaving the world you've created - is always a kind of emotionally wrenching experience. I usually cry.": "Lauren",
  "Experience teaches us that we do not always receive the blessings we ask for in prayer.": "Mary",
  "Disease is an experience of a so-called mortal mind. It is fear made manifest on the body.": "Mary",
  "We owned what we learned back there the experience and the growth are grafted into our lives. ": "Ellen",
  "Whatever the opposite of regret is best describes how I've always felt about that decision - it opened me up to a million creative opportunities I needed to experience away from the bull and distorting mirrors that fame engenders.": "David",
  "Sure, 'An Inconvenient Truth' was my first documentary. What a wonderful experience. I saw Al Gore doing his slideshow presentation, and had this nutty idea that we had to make a movie out of it.": "Lawrence",
  "The resistance of a woman is not always a proof of her virtue, but more frequently of her experience.": "Ninon",
  "I offer my expertise and experience for hire in order to help a group of people reach the summit.": "Anatoli",
  "Real love is a permanently self-enlarging experience.": "M.",
  "The trouble with this country is that there are too many politicians who believe, with a conviction based on experience, that you can fool all of the people all of the time.": "Franklin",
  "Undeniably the American art form, too. And yet more and more, we see films made that diminish the American experience and example. And sometimes trash it completely.": "Charlton",
  "You've got Washington picking winners and losers. And so, all of a sudden, decisions are being made on what helps politicians, not what helps the economy. Some will call it socialism. Some will call it a command and control economy. Whatever it is, it's antithetical to the American experience.": "Jeb",

So I pride myself on speaking my mind and not being afraid to give honest feedback.": "Nate",
  "I say I am stronger than fear.": "Malala",
  "Fear and euphoria are dominant forces, and fear is many multiples the size of euphoria. Bubbles go up very slowly as euphoria builds. Then fear hits, and it comes down very sharply.

  "Noam Chomsky has a book, which I read for the first time when I was in Spain, called 'Fear of Democracy'. There is your answer. Fear of democracy. In Honduras, they had a sham democracy. It was run by elites, what was called a liberal democracy, but in reality was a false democracy.": "Hugo",
  "It is the truth of grace and not of the law that brings you true freedom. The truth of the law only binds you. In fact, religious bondage is one of the most crippling bondages with which a person can be encumbered. Religious bondage keeps one in constant fear, guilt, and anxiety.": "Joseph",

  "I hesitate to use a pathologizing label, but underneath the so-called narcissistic personality is definitely shame and the paralyzing fear of being ordinary.": "Brene",

  "Americans are apocalyptic by nature. The reason why is that we've always had so much, so we live in deadly fear that people are going to take it away from us.": "Stephen",
  "To talk about balance, it's easier to talk about what's out of balance. And I think anytime that you have any disease, and disease meaning lack of ease, lack of flow... dis-ease. So any time there's disease, you're out of balance, whether it's jealousy, anger, greed, anxiety, fear.": "Ricky",
  "I'm a guy who has problems with moderation. All or nothing. Binge and purge. Kill or be killed. Gray is not a color I wear well. I should be dead. I know that. I should not be successful.

  "When you say 'fear of the unknown', that is the definition of fear; fear is the unknown, fear is what you do not know, and it's genetically within us so that we feel safe. We feel scared of the woods because we're not familiar with it, and that keeps you safe.": "M.",
  "When men don't fear God, they give themselves to evil.": "Ray",
  "I've been quite fascinated by the relative insignificance of human existence, the shortness of life.

  "'Dream Act' kids are like all other American kids, with the exception that they have to work harder to excel in school, they live in fear of deportation, and they worry about their future.": "Jeff",
  "A lot of people would say 'sexy' is about the body. But to me, 'sexy' is a woman with confidence. I admire women who have very little fear.": "Allegra",
  "The bracelet says 'Fear Nothing.' It was given to me by my friends, and it was made for me and my friends during the period of time that I was going through chemotherapy.

  "There is that awful moment when you realize that you're falling in love. That should be the most joyful moment, and actually it's not. It's always a moment that's full of fear because you know, as night follows day, the joy is going to rapidly be followed by some pain or other. All the angst of a relationship.": "Helen",
  "I greatly fear some of America's greatest and most dangerous enemies are such as think themselves her best friends.": "Nathan",
  "I'm sure the feeling of fear, as long as you can take advantage of it and not be rendered useless by it, can make you extend yourself beyond what you would regard as your capacity.

  "Every journey starts with fear.": "Jake",
  "For me, there is only love and fear.": "Pink",
  "Positive health means becoming whole-heartedly engaged with our own health care. It means not outsourcing our health to the health care system. It means getting rid of the fear and paralysis we too often feel, and instead cultivating a sense of agency.": "Jane",

  "Usually when I start a new project there's a fear of the unknown; maybe it's a band I've never been in the studio with before. People are so different. It's almost like you need to go through the process, discover and unlock what it is that makes that band that band. And a lot of times they don't know it.": "Rick",
  "An honest cop still can't find a place to go and complain without fear of recrimination. The blue wall will always be there because the system supports it.": "Frank",

  "There was a point where I was making four movies a year. I was always on a set. I had no stories to tell. I was feeling empty.

And the moment I started to feel that fear, I stopped and I slowed down.": "Penelope",
  "What you wear for work should be comfortable and empowering. If you're working in business, your outfit should mean business. If I go to meet somebody about an acting job, or something creative, then I'll be in my jeans. For me, overdressing is my biggest fear.": "Twiggy",

  "See how fortune deludes us, and that which we put carefully into her hands, she either breaks or lets it fall from her hands, or causes it to be removed by the violence of another, or suffocates and poisons, or taints with suspicion, fear and jealousy to the great hurt and ruin of the possessor.": "Giordano",
  "The raccoons, foxes, beavers, chinchillas, minks, rabbits, and yes, sometimes even dogs and cats that are killed for fur are not very different from your beloved dog or cat. They all have eyes, ears and hearts. They all experience pain when they are physically maimed. They shake with fear when they experience terror.": "Jane",

  "But now having seen him which is invisible I fear not what man can do unto me.": "Anne",
  "My coming to faith did not start with a leap but rather a series of staggers from what seemed like one safe place to another. Like lily pads, round and green, these places summoned and then held me up while I grew.

  "Fear can be good when you're walking past an alley at night or when you need to check the locks on your doors before you go to bed, but it's not good when you have a goal and you're fearful of obstacles. We often get trapped by our fears, but anyone who has had success has failed before.": "Queen",
  "Probably I have more phobias, fear and eccentricities than I would care to admit. I don't think I'm in danger of losing my mind, but I do often question my own behavior. I have a very bad temper, and it's not always healthy for me and for others. I make my way in the world more difficult, and I could do with a little more yoga.": "Denis",
  "The mark of fear is not easily removed.": "Ernest",
  "I do still get extremely nervous before speeches. My biggest fear is that I'll be standing there in front of hundreds of people and be incapable of talking. I'm afraid that I'll make a complete fool of myself and be unable to go on.": "Marcus",
  "Our redemption through the suffering of Christ is that deeper love within us which not only frees us from slavery to sin, but also secures for us the true liberty of the children of God, in order that we might do all things out of love rather than out of fear - love for him that has shown us such grace that no greater can be found.": "Peter",

  "I definitely think cheerleaders have no fear.": "Ashley",

  "I've always had a huge fear of dying or becoming ill. The thing I'm most afraid of, though, is being alone, which I think a lot of performers fear. It's why we seek the limelight - so we're not alone, were adored. We're loved, so people want to be around us. The fear of being alone drives my life.": "Jennifer",

  "Fear is the foundation of safety.": "Tertullian",
  "Because the biological mechanisms that affect our health and well-being are so dynamic, when people change their diet and lifestyle, they usually feel so much better, so quickly; it reframes the reason for changing from fear of dying to joy of living. Also, the support that patients give each other is a powerful motivator.": "Dean",

  "Where there is reverence there is fear, but there is not reverence everywhere that there is fear, because fear presumably has a wider extension than reverence.": "Socrates",
  "I've always had to conquer fear when I'm on stage. Basically, I was and still am a very shy person. It's absolutely in conflict with what I do. But once I deliver the first joke I'm okay. It's like I'm out there all by myself just delivering my lines to nobody in particular without ever trying to notice the audience in front of me.": "Steven",
  "It sounds funny, but my biggest fear is that I'm not perfect. I'm a perfectionist, and I get upset when things go wrong or when I don't do well.": "Nick",
  "Not being happy really is my fear.": "Keke",
  "Senators say they fear the N.R.A. and the gun lobby. But I think that fear must be nothing compared to the fear the first graders in Sandy Hook Elementary School felt as their lives ended in a hail of bullets.": "Gabrielle",

  "Having a child, that's always been my biggest fear. I want a child and I fear a child.": "Marilyn",
  "You can't be afraid to put out a fire if you're a fireman. You can't be afraid to be a police officer and carry a gun if you're afraid to get up and go out there. So you've got to put that fear to the side and go out in faith to overcome that.": "Duane",
  "'Freedom from fear' could be said to sum up the whole philosophy of human rights.": "Dag",

  "For me, personally, when I'm afraid of something - when you're afraid of something, normally you try to go away, you try to avoid it. Instead of avoiding it, to overcome your fear, I believe you need to embrace it.": "Georges",
  "I still worry that I could be better. That's where standards come from, from not wanting to settle. The fear of not being good enough propels you.": "April",
  "Dolls fire our collective imagination, for better and - too often - for worse. From life-size dolls the same height as the little girls who carry them, to dolls whose long hair can 'grow' longer, to Barbie and her fashionable sisters, dolls do double duty as child's play and the focus of adult art and adult fear.": "Ellen",

  "You're not human if you don't feel fear. But I've learnt to treat fear as an emotion that sharpens me. It's there to give me that edge for what I have to do.": "Bear",
  "Stage fright is my worst problem. A voice is very intimate. It's something of your own. So there's always this fear, because you feel naked. There's a fear of not reaching up to expectations.": "Andrea",

  "A company is stronger if it is bound by love rather than by fear.": "Herb",

  "I came from a very loving home, had a happy life with no great aspirations, but going to the seminary changed me. There was a chunk of my childhood missing. Once I'd realised it wasn't for me, I still felt a tremendous pressure to continue for fear of letting everybody down.": "Johnny",
  "Five decades ago, as India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, began visibly ailing, the nation and the world were consumed by the question: 'After Nehru, who?' The inexpressible fear lay in the subtext to the question: 'After Nehru, what?'": "Shashi",
  "I have lived so long among people who do not understand me, been so long accustomed to refrain and disguise myself for fear of being laughed at, that I have grown as difficult to come at as a snail in a shell; and what is worse, I cannot come out of my shell when I wish it.": "Jane",
  "For me, it's a real shock to see American mainstream films. I can't see these films because it's always the same thing to me. This is very American. Violence is very American, and I can't understand these films. Why do they use violence? To show what? Masculinity? To show fear? Defense? What are you showing with all this violence?": "Javier",
  "Let us go forth with fear and courage and rage to save the world.": "Grace",

  "People speak of the fear of the blank canvas as though it is a temporary hesitation, a trembling moment of self-doubt.

  "The responses that environmentalists evoke - fear, anxiety, numbness, despair - are not helpful, even if they are understandable. It should be fascinating, even enthralling, to be in the milieu of environmental change.": "Paul",

  "We have nothing to fear but fear itself... and, of course, the boogieman.": "Pat",
  "Fear is an underrated emotion. And that's why I think it's very dangerous to try and cosset children from it. A healthy scare is as good as as a healthy laugh. In fact, they're two sides of the same coin. There is a desire to shield from the knocks and bumps of reality.": "Mark",
  "I will not counter the insanity of the PATRIOT Act with an overblown fear of my rights being taken away.": "Penn",

  "Anyone who agrees to be interviewed must decide where to draw the line between what is public and what is private. But the line can shift, depending on who is asking the questions.

  "Things done well and with a care, exempt themselves from fear.": "William",
  "Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the dangers of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crackpot' than the stigma of conformity. And on issues that seem important to you, stand up and be counted at any cost.": "Chauncey",

  "Fear is the dark room where the Devil develops his negatives.": "Gary",
  "Columbine was so frightening. And the media took off with it, like everything else, so it instilled more fear in people. You're looking around at school for kids like the ones who committed the shootings, and you feel wrong for doing that, you know?": "John",

  "Fear has nothing to do with cowardice. A fellow is only yellow when he lets his fear make him quit.": "Jerome",
  "Fear tends to manifest itself much more quickly than greed, so volatile markets tend to be on the downside. In up markets, volatility tends to gradually decline.": "Philip",
  "Americans are in a cycle of fear which leads to people not wanting to spend and not wanting to make investments, and that leads to more fear. We'll break out of it. It takes time.": "Warren",
  "My dear brother Barack Obama has a certain fear of free black men. As a young brother who grows up in a white context, brilliant African father, he's always had to fear being a white man with black skin. All he has known culturally is white. He has a certain rootlessness, a deracination.": "Cornel",
  "I was in a band in the '90s called Bikini Kill, and we were so freaked out about documentation then, and there was the whole thing, not just about the male gaze, but that people were going to misrepresent you... a kind fear of the mainstream that a lot of us had.": "Kathleen",
  "I like those crisis moments - if you're on top of it and don't get pulled under by panic and fear, it's a very bonding thing.": "Bill",
  "I think there's a lot projected on beautiful women, period. At least, maybe this is just my fear, but I do sometimes feel dismissed before I've even been allowed to participate. I have moments of feeling really wounded. But I am pretty optimistic, and I do enjoy a lot of my life.": "Shalom",
  "There are few things more liberating in this life than having your worst fear realized.": "Conan",
  "I think masculinity is bravado against the mystery of the universe of women. It's just a fear of not knowing what women have that's so powerful. It's this shield they put up to try to get closer.": "K.",
  "I fear no man, no beast or evil, brother.": "Hulk",

  "Bad news sells because the amygdala is always looking for something to fear.": "Peter",
  "I always say three things make a writer: inspiration, obviously; perspiration, doing the work. But the third is desperation. I'm not really fit for anything else, or to have a real job. That fear drives me. The pressure has always been self inflicted.": "Harlan",
  "But I love being scared. I think you're brave only when you do things that scare you. I've always used fear as a motivator. I'm not sure why.": "Ginnifer",
  "My biggest fear in writing 'Gossip Girl' was that the characters would sound like stereotypical rich, air-headed heiresses. These were my friends. They were smart and multifaceted. They had interests and passions. They wanted to become lawyers and doctors and writers and filmmakers.": "Cecily",
  "At the root of the shy temperament is a deep fear of social judgment, one so severe it can sometimes be crippling. Introverted people don't worry unduly about whether they'll be found wanting, they just find too much socializing exhausting and would prefer either to be alone or in the company of a select few people.": "Jeffrey",
  "I think that my leadership style is to get people to fear staying in place, to fear not changing.": "Louis",
  "I've always felt alienated. I realized that I've been terrified my entire life. So I can identify that fear which drives so many of the people that I write about.": "Hubert",

  "I've always been petrified of working for a boss who I didn't like but who I was in fear of, because I wanted my salary.": "Simon",
  "I was a mother who worked ridiculously hard to keep catastrophe at bay. I didn't allow my kids to eat hamburgers for fear of E. coli. I didn't allow them to play with rope, string, balloons - anything that might strangle them. They had to bite grapes in half, avoid lollipops, eat only when I could watch them.": "Ann",
  "I've done plenty of daredeviling - from white-water rafting to bungee jumping. But I think the most fearless was hosting the Emmy Awards. It was overwhelming, and I definitely had to leave fear at the door.": "Neil",
  "I have turned away from the thought of writing fiction in the past through what I suppose is, actually, fear. The direct, raw invitation for the reader to come in and explore my imagination is fairly scary for me so I have busied myself with so much else.": "Dawn",
  "My dad had this thing - everyone in Canada wants to play hockey; that's all they want to do. So when I was a kid, whenever we skated my dad would not let us on the ice without hockey sticks, because of this insane fear we would become figure skaters!": "Norm",
  "Just what is it that academics have to fear if they stand up for common decency, instead of letting campus barbarians run amok?": "Thomas",
  "Instead of showing strangers kindness and giving them the benefit of the doubt, we increasingly show them only fear, and that is bad for us and them.": "Julian",
  "For me personally, I have a fear of, 'If I stop, I'm going to die.' If I stop doing the things that are enriching to me or creatively exciting to me or if I stop creating, then I feel stagnant. If something isn't growing, it's dying.": "Chris",
  "We can fear things into existence. Fear looks into the future and imagines the worst that can happen.": "Joyce",
  "Most serious writers refuse to make themselves available to the things that technology is doing. I've never been able to understand this sort of fear.": "William",
  "In the end, I am quite normal. I don't have odd habits. I don't dramatize. Above all, I do not romanticize the act of writing. I don't talk about the anguish I suffer in creating. I do not have a fear of the blank page, writer's block, all those things that we hear about writers.": "Jose",
  "The stereotypes of feminists as ugly, or man-haters, or hairy, or whatever it is - that's really strategic. That's a really smart way to keep young women away from feminism, is to kind of put out this idea that all feminists hate men, or all feminists are ugly; and that they really come from a place of fear.": "Jessica",
  "The economics of the security world are all horribly, horribly nasty and are largely based on fear, intimidation and blackmail.": "Linus",
  "I don't even know why, but I've just always done it - I don't walk on handicapped parking spaces. I don't like to step on the blue lines. I always step over them. I don't know what the deal is. I don't know if it's a fear of injury, or a disrespectful thing, or if I just don't want to think about something like that happening.": "Chantal",
  "Essentially, I am a dreamer. I've dreamed all my life. When I started, I dreamed I'd be Champion because it is a sport that is all about the people who win the most, and I have a fear of not winning.": "Tony",

  "I have struggled for decades now with the fear of and resistance to change - mostly in the realms of technology, transportation, and the ways people choose to communicate. If I had a theme song, it would be that lovely song 'I'm Old-Fashioned,' as sung by Ella Fitzgerald.": "Julia",
  "The most blatant forms of denialism are rarely malevolent; they combine decency, a fear of change, and the misguided desire to do good - for our health, our families, and the world. That is why so many physicians dismiss the idea that a patient's race can, and often should, be used as a tool for better diagnoses and treatment.": "Michael",
  "Californians are people who insist on growing their own vegetables, but they won't dig up the pretty lawn, won't plant anything for fear of getting dirty, and they use fragrant bath salts from The Body Shop instead of smelly compost.": "P.",

  "My biggest fear is mindlessly and stupidly repeating myself.": "John",
  "If someone's got a fear of heights, they'd probably say, well, hanging off a helicopter at 3,000 feet above downtown L.A. would be the scariest. For me, that's a day's work, something I was very happy to do.": "Jason",

  "The terrorists are fighting freedom with all their cunning and cruelty because freedom is their greatest fear - and they should be afraid, because freedom is on the march.": "George",
  "When fear makes your choices for you, no security measures on earth will keep the things you dread from finding you.

  "Sides are being divided now. It's very obvious. So if you're on the other side of the fence, you're suddenly anti-American. It's breeding fear of being on the wrong side.": "Sam",
  "The fear of becoming a 'has-been' keeps some people from becoming anything.": "Eric",

  "You know, sometimes I feel well and vital in the world, and sometimes I just feel so distressed I want to pull my hair out by the roots.": "Sharon",

  "Sleep makes people calmer, more alert, less fearful - just plain happier, or so I see around me and in me. I am sure that if this great nation were to concentrate on getting more sleep, we would be a happier, more confident people, and that by itself would be a major achievement.": "Ben",
  "We often pretend to fear what we really despise, and more often despise what we really fear.": "Charles",
  "I fear we might be losing the basic human facility to be alone - and with that you throw out independent decision-making, what to trust, what not to trust; key stuff - a perilous loss.": "Dylan",
  "As with most phobias, the fear of flying does make some sense, but if ever there was a fear worth quashing then this is it. After all, life is short, and there's a great big world to explore out there.": "Beth",

  "He whom many fear, has himself many to fear.": "Publilius",
  "The brutal truth is, we're scarcely 'educating' children at all.

  "I came seriously close to getting married four times, and each time I backed off in fear or for one reason or another. Each occasion was different, but in hindsight when I look at the people involved, it wasn't a bad thing what I did. I think it may have been more complex had the marriage taken place.": "Ratan",

  "I think for me, or for anyone who plays the quarterback position, it's almost an unspoken word when you think about leadership.

  "Bill Gates can't control a high-level-energy dog, because his energy is very low, very calm. Very intellectual. A dog doesn't see that as leadership.": "Cesar",
  "Leadership does take work. And it should. If you aspire to be a leader, you ought to treat leadership as a craft, you ought to become a student of it, and you ought to work at it. And if you're not willing to work at it, well, you get what you give.": "Douglas",
  "If more women are in leadership roles, we'll stop assuming they shouldn't be.": "Sheryl",
  "I vividly remember a conversation I had many years ago in 1974, which marked a turning point in my leadership journey. I was sitting at a Holiday Inn with my friend, Kurt Campmeyer, when he asked me if I had a personal growth plan. I didn't. In fact, I didn't even know you were supposed to have one.": "John",
  "I learned early on that one of the secrets of campus leadership was the simplest thing of all: speak to people coming down the sidewalk before they speak to you. I would always look ahead and speak to the person coming toward me. If I knew them I would call them by name, but even if I didn't I would still speak to them.": "Sam",
  "I think leadership is not something you learn it's something you discover. ": "Myles",
  "In this age, I don't care how tactically or operationally brilliant you are: if you cannot create harmony - even vicious harmony - on the battlefield based on trust across service lines, across coalition and national lines, and across civilian/military lines, you need to go home, because your leadership is obsolete.": "James",
  "I know that millions of Americans from all walks of life agree with me that leadership does not mean putting the ear to the ground to follow public opinion, but to have the vision of what is necessary and the courage to make it possible.": "Shirley",
  "When I decided to leave the military, I realized that the skills I acquired there were transferable to the commercial world both in leadership and the information technology field. I made the decision to move to Oracle because of its strong leadership role.": "Keith",

  "The Leadership Training Institute of America trains and equips young men and women to be leaders with high standards of personal morality and integrity.": "Michael",
  "Beginning under the Roman Empire, intellectual leadership in the West had been provided by Christianity. In the middle ages, who invented the first universities - in Paris, Oxford, Cambridge? The church.": "Nancy",
  "We're trained to see the world in terms of charismatic organizations and charismatic people. That's who we look to for leadership and change, for transformation. We're awaiting the next J.F.K., the next Martin Luther King, the next Gandhi, the next Nelson Mandela.": "Paul",
  "I helped to restore America's leadership.": "Hillary",
  "We also can't try to take over and rebuild every country that falls into crisis. That's not leadership; that's a recipe for quagmire, spilling American blood and treasure that ultimately weakens us. It's the lesson of Vietnam, of Iraq - and we should have learned it by now.": "Barack",
  "I feel comfortable in a position of leadership, but that's not to say I feel complacent about it. I take it incredibly seriously.": "Nicola",
  "One of the main ways that leadership stays in power is by, in various ways, convincing people that they should just let those who are in government govern: 'Trust us. Trust me. Just let us take care of things. Stay out of it.' Your opinions don't really matter. You are isolated. You are insignificant.": "Viggo",
  "I speak directly to the people, and I know that the people of California want to have better leadership. They want to have great leadership. They want to have somebody that will represent them. And it doesn't matter if you're a Democrat or a Republican, young or old.": "Arnold",

  "In the conversation about women in leadership, male voices are noticeably absent.": "Adam",
  "Sometimes leadership is planting trees under whose shade you'll never sit. It may not happen fully till after I'm gone. But I know that the steps we're taking are the right steps.": "Jennifer",
  "There is a new model of leadership in the world that rides on the premise that every single person in the organisation can be a leader. Titles are important for structure and order, but real power does not come from titles.": "Robin",
  "We are watching industries crumble, Wall Street firms disappear, unemployment spike, and unprecedented government intervention. And our designated opinion leaders want to know: Is Obama up this week? Is he down? And is his leadership style more like Bill Clinton's, or Abraham Lincoln's?": "Thomas",
  "I now sit at the table in a variety of ways with the House leadership... as we go through taking a look at threat assessments and hot spots around the world. It's a national position, but certainly I don't forget that New Jersey has a critical part of national defense.": "Rodney",
  "Under Superintendent Johnson's leadership, our police department is on a path to earn the respect of every community in the City of Chicago.": "Rahm",

  "People more than ever since I can remember are concerned about being out of step and out of line with their political party and won't cross over. There is nobody, man or woman, who wants to be left out, and people are fearful of that. People are fearful of their leadership as well.": "Gary",
  "Ben Roethlisberger is a proven winner in athletic competition. But the measure of a true leader is how they conduct themselves 24/7, not just during a winning touchdown drive or a goal-line stance. Leadership isn't something that gets switched off because the game clock expires.": "Jackson",
  "The conductor is the artistic leader and sometimes cultural arbiter of his or her community. It is their leadership that is looked to and should anything go wrong, they are the persons taking most of the heat.": "Leonard",
  "To me, leadership is about encouraging people. It's about stimulating them. It's about enabling them to achieve what they can achieve - and to do that with a purpose.": "Christine",
  "I emphasize self-esteem, self-confidence, and dignity, not as an ideal, but as a real test of community organization. Without leadership development, community organizations do not have staying power.": "Paul",
  "The current leadership of the Labor party react to the idea that working-class students might study the subjects they studied with the same horror that the Earl of Grantham showed when a chauffeur wanted to marry his daughter.": "Michael",
  "In 'Henry V,' the story of the assumption of true and responsible leadership by Henry I think is hard-won. He has to lose friends; he has to risk his life.": "Kenneth",
  "Today's world requires a different leadership style - more collaboration and teamwork, including using Web 2.0 technologies. If you had told me I'd be video blogging and blogging, I would have said, 'No way.' And yet our 20-somethings in the company really pushed me to use that more.": "John",
  "I think you need to be intentional at times about your leadership - where you're eating lunch, who you're interacting with, making guys feel like you're interested in what they're doing. If it's authentic, then it's going to be an easy conversation and easy hangout time.": "Aaron",
  "If you don't understand that you work for your mislabeled 'subordinates', then you know nothing of leadership. You know only tyranny.": "Dee",

  "We're in a leadership position in sports. People look up to the National Football League.": "Roger",
  "Leadership comes in small acts as well as bold strokes.": "Carly",
  "I don't pretend there aren't biological differences, but I don't believe the desire for leadership is hardwired biology, not the desire to win or excel. I believe that it's socialization, that we're socializing our daughters to nurture and our boys to lead.": "Sheryl",
  "We need leadership in this country, which will improve the lives of working families, the children, the elderly, the sick and the poor. We need leadership which brings our people together and makes us stronger.": "Bernie",
  "The employer generally gets the employees he deserves.": "J.",
  "Our next-door neighbour taught physics at Hampton University. Our church abounded with mathematicians. Supersonics experts held leadership positions in my mother's sorority, and electrical engineers sat on the board of my parents' college alumni associations.": "Margot",
  "The more that social democracy develops, grows, and becomes stronger, the more the enlightened masses of workers will take their own destinies, the leadership of their movement, and the determination of its direction into their own hands.": "Rosa",
  "Our discomfort with female leadership runs deep. We call little girls bossy. We never really call little boys bossy, because a boy is expected to lead, so it doesn't surprise or offend.": "Sheryl",
  "It is essential to employ, trust, and reward those whose perspective, ability, and judgment are radically different from yours. It is also rare, for it requires uncommon humility, tolerance, and wisdom.": "Dee",
  "Leadership offers an opportunity to make a difference in someone's life, no matter what the project.": "Bill",
  "My best investment, as cliched as this sounds, is the money I've spent developing myself, via books, workshops and coaching. Leadership begins within, and to have a better career, start by building a better you.": "Robin",
  "The highest calling of leadership is to challenge the status quo and unlock the potential of others. We need a leader who will lead the resurgence of this great nation and unlock its potential once again.": "Carly",
  "For me, leadership is making a difference. It's using your agency to bring about change.": "Melanne"
