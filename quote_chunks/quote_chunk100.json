  "Without social networks, you're not the coolest thing on the Christmas list, and you're not getting any bite.": "Joe",
  "I would like to go back and spend a Christmas with my family and myself when I was five years old and just see what that dynamic would be like. Observe it. I think it would be a magical gift.": "Sharon",
  "I actually share her view and understand her frustration when any government attempts to ban secular symbols like Santa Claus or Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer or Christmas lights.": "Steve",
  "I hate Christmas, really. I don't really give presents away or expect any.": "Joy",
  "On Christmas, my family and I see a movie and go out for Chinese food. We don't celebrate Christmas in the traditional sense, in that we do not actually celebrate Christmas.": "Eden",
  "I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but I do think 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a very good. I always thought 'Walk the Line' was very good, too.": "Thomas",
  "Coming from Chicago, I like a white Christmas.": "Dennis",
  "Throughout my college years, I'd watch my sister squeal every Christmas as she unwrapped another 'Buffy' DVD set. I didn't know much about the series, but I was filled with that obnoxious self-importance that comes from having decided to be an Academic Who Reads Serious Things.": "Marie",
  "If you pray enough for things, I am proof that they can happen. I feel like a kid on Christmas day now, every day. It's something I have wanted for a long time and I am as happy as anyone to be here. It is great to be back at my first love.": "Robbie",
  "So when I was 13, I basically left home and never returned and lived at home again. I would come home for a week at Christmas and two weeks in the summer only.": "Peter",
  "I'm well-travelled so I can see places coming up. I went to St. Croix in the West Indies at Christmas and it had been hit by a really bad tornado. Values there have gone down but I guarantee they will be up again in eight years. So I'll get in now while it's cheap as chips.": "Melanie",
  "One of my favorite movies of all time is 'It's A Wonderful Life,' which is a pretty interesting choice for a seasonal Christmas favorite, because it's about a guy who wants to commit suicide and is presented with reasons not to.": "Frank",
  "If you're an English actor, and you're asked to do an episode - especially the Christmas episode - of 'Downton Abbey,' you can't turn it down. It's like, 'Of course!'": "Janet",
  "Christmas always rustled. It rustled every time, mysteriously, with silver and gold paper, tissue paper and a rich abundance of shiny paper, decorating and hiding everything and giving a feeling of reckless extravagance.": "Tove",
  "Mummy weighed sweets and nuts so that everyone would get exactly the same amount. During the year, everything is measured roughly, but at Christmas, it has to be absolutely fair. That's why it's such a strenuous time.": "Tove",
  "Nothing is as peaceful as when Christmas is over, when one has been forgiven for everything and can be normal again.": "Tove",
  "My father died when I was really young, on Christmas Day.": "David",
  "The loneliest ebb of my life came on that Christmas eve, only one day after my arrival in New York. The abyss of loneliness. I ate a solitary dinner in a small cafe, and the very food tasted bitter with my unshed tears. One doesn't dare cry in America. It is unmanly here.": "Rudolph",
  "Please to put a nickel, please to put a dime. How petitions trickle in at Christmas time!": "Phyllis",
  "Throughout my teenage years, I read 'A Christmas Carol' by Charles Dickens every December. It was a story that never failed to excite me, for as well as being a Dickens enthusiast, I have always loved ghost stories.": "John",
  "People say I don't write books, I make Christmas presents.": "Bryce",
  "Chum was a British boy's weekly which, at the end of the year was bound into a single huge book; and the following Christmas parents bought it as Christmas presents for male children.": "A.",
  "I went to Sunday School and liked the stories about Christ and the Christmas star. They were beautiful. They made you warm and happy to think about. But I didn't believe them.": "Frances",
  "Our whole family assembles in Chicago at Christmas and usually in Aspen in the summer.": "James",
  "I started with the Target Company in 1993 when their Christmas theme that year was 'It's A Wonderful Life,' and they reunited the actors who played the Bailey kids. So we went all over and really had a blast getting the love from all of the fans and thought, 'Whoopty-doo, there's something going on here.'": "Karolyn",
  "What I found out on Christmas Day 1984, through biochemical evidence, was that telomeres could be lengthened by the enzyme we called telomerase, which keeps the telomeres from wearing down. After I found that out, I went home and put on Bruce Springsteen's 'Born in the USA,' which was just out, and I danced and danced and danced.": "Carol",
  "I asked for a guitar when I was 8 years old for Christmas. I have no idea why. I never had any guitar heroes. I still don't. But there must have been something in me because I've been playing for 30 years.": "Jamie",
  "Christmas renews our youth by stirring our wonder. The capacity for wonder has been called our most pregnant human faculty, for in it are born our art, our science, our religion.": "Ralph",
  "I think Christmas is about celebration and come on, on the inside everyone wants to dance.": "TobyMac",
  "I'm not going to put out a Christmas CD until it's coming out of me naturally.": "TobyMac",
  "During the holidays, everyone needs a break from studying for exams and Christmas shopping. I wanted to put together a diverse tour that rocks in many musical directions but always points to Christ.": "TobyMac",
  "I grew up with the classics. My mom and I would sit and watch 'Singin' in the Rain' and 'White Christmas' - those kind of movies.": "Lucas",
  "Our children await Christmas presents like politicians getting in election returns: there's the Uncle Fred precinct and the Aunt Ruth district still to come in.": "Marcelene",
  "I owe my life to my father. I remember that my first Christmas present was a ball. In the district where we lived, there weren't many kids who had one.": "Sergio",
  "Like my best friend, I asked for drums for Christmas, and got them. But when he moved on to guitar, I realized two things: (1) guitar is a much more expressive instrument, (2) way more girls pay attention to guitar players than to drummers.": "Greg",
  "After church on the Sunday after Thanksgiving, my family would go chop down our Christmas tree. Once it was home and placed in its stand, Mom and I would painstakingly decorate our tree. It took hours to place the tinsel, string the lights, find the perfect spot for my favorite macaroni and felt ornaments from kindergarten.": "Molly",
  "Christmas is a season which almost all Christians observe in one way or another. Some keep it as a religious season. Some keep it as a holiday. But all over the world, wherever there are Christians, in one way or another Christmas is kept.": "J.",
  "When I was eight, my mum found me humming to myself and scribbling on a scrap of paper. When she asked me what I was doing, I got shy. I was writing a Christmas song, and I had never shared my music with anyone before. Reluctantly, I sang it for her... and she loved it. Of course she did - she's my mum.": "Neil",
  "I love Christmas. I really do love Christmas. I love being with my family and I love snow. I love the music and the lights and all of it.": "Christina",
  "Bloody Christmas, here again, let us raise a loving cup, peace on earth, goodwill to men, and make them do the washing up.": "Wendy",
  "'A Tuna Christmas' is the second in a series of plays created by Joe Sears and Jaston Williams featuring the fictional town of Greater Tuna, the third-smallest town in Texas. What makes these plays so hysterically funny is the accurate portrayal of small-town life in the Lone Star State.": "Lori",
  "The most challenging roles were Disney's 'A Christmas Carol' and 'Mars Needs Moms' because they were both motion capture, so there was a lot of physical work involved.": "Raymond",
  "One of my favorite times of year is around Christmas when my entire family gets together and we make tamales together. It's a full two-day event, and we create an assembly line. It's awesome because everyone has his or her own part in making the dish. It's so much fun.": "Sabrina",
  "There are some people who want to throw their arms round you simply because it is Christmas there are other people who want to strangle you simply because it is Christmas. ": "Robert",
  "But Tammy Faye calls me, and Ron Jeremy calls me, Erik Estrada sends me a Christmas card every year.": "Trishelle",
  "I feel like I've got a pretty relatively extensive Christmas sweatshirt collection.": "Kyle",
  "We didn't have a whole lot of money when I was growing up either. I would always ask for magic books or magic tricks for my birthday or for Christmas and the rest of the year I either had to mow lawns or find part time jobs to help supplement the cost of doing magic.": "Lance",
  "I watched a lot of movies when I was younger and I remember, when I was seven years old, I asked my parents if I could have an agent for Christmas.": "Meaghan",
  "'Joker' was a violent, dark, and brutal book, so I wanted to do something a little less heavy. I played around with the idea of a children's book, and that eventually became 'Noel.' And I just kept finding these parallels between things I could do with Batman and Charles Dickens' 'A Christmas Carol.'": "Lee",
  "I'm not a fan of musicals at all, but I do think 'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is a very good. I always thought 'Walk the Line' was very good, too. I was in 'Nowhere Boy.' I played Paul McCartney. That was kind of musical - we did songs in that.": "Thomas",
  "I started DJing, breakdancing and MCing in the '70s and I got my record deal in 1979 with 'Christmas Rap.'": "Kurtis",
  "Christmas is far and away my favorite holiday. I love everything about it, from the event that inspired it, hoping for a white one, to wrapping presents. But mostly I love having family and friends gathered, and sharing traditions.": "Ellen",
  "Besides the two Christmas things, we've got a about a dozen new tracks we're working on.": "Chris",
  "Well, because I have twin seven-year-old boys, I enjoy the gift giving stuff a great deal. We do both Hanukkah and Christmas, so it is a costly, though extremely pleasing proposition.": "Fred",
  "Christmas was always a big holiday in our family. Every Christmas Eve before we'd go to bed, my mom and dad would read to us two or three stories and they would always be 'The Happy Prince,' 'The Gift of the Magi' and 'Twas the Night Before Christmas,' and I would like to keep that alive.": "Cameron",
  "Yep, I'm a geek. Ever since I got the Millennium Falcon for Christmas in 1978. And I still have it, in perfect condition, just without the box... but I still play with it!": "Joseph",
  "I don't think of Home Depot as romantic, but I do think the Christmas wonderland they put up during the holidays is magical. That is what Home Depot is to me, and that is the only romantic thing about it.": "Betty",
  "I worked every day - Christmas Eve, birthdays - trying to become a great basketball player. Everywhere I went, I had a basketball.": "Harvey",
  "I realised that you could easily turn any room into a cinema with a projector, so I went on and on at my parents for one. They eventually got me a projector for Christmas when I was ten, and I realised I'd made a ridiculous mistake - I'd forgotten to say 'movie' projector; I got a still one.": "Kevin",
  "'White Christmas' is one of my favorite movies, so I've always just had a love for that kind of golden era musical.": "Jessie",
  "At the age of 12, my parents gave me a chemistry set for Christmas, and experimentation soon became a consuming passion in my life.": "John",
  "Everyone knows that there are some odors that send you directly back to memories of your childhood - odors from Christmas time and so forth.": "May-Britt",
  "I've also committed my time and resources to many local organizations like Christmas in April, Catholic Community Services, and Hudson County Meals on Wheels.": "Vincent",
  "My dad was fairly well-off, so I was raised in a very comfortable environment: the very nice suburbs of Paris. It was a very idyllic life. I also spent nearly all my summers in Britain, and Christmas, too, because my grandparents lived there.": "Sebastian",
  "The South has a way of worshipping appearances - the suburbs are all about presentation and amazing flowers and a beautiful yard and dinner parties that impress people and having the Christmas lights just right.": "Paul",
  "In 1934, the American Jewish charities offered to find homes for 300 German refugee children. We were on the SS Washington, bound for New York, Christmas 1934.": "Jack",
  "I've also just finished filming the role of Robert Brown in 'Just William,' which is due to transmit on BBC One at Christmas.": "Harry",
  "My younger brother will remember that he received a transistor radio for Christmas. I took it apart and it never worked again.": "Stephen",
  "I like to spend Christmas with family and friends, pigging out, exchanging gifts and basically doing nothing.": "George",
  "I grew up playing games, and I remember Christmas 1981 when my dad got us an Intellivision, and we all sat around and played 'Astrosmash' for hours on end. It was a big part of my youth.": "Roger",
  "I don't go back home to Sardinia as much as I would like, just for Christmas and family events.": "Caterina",
  "I had heard some Elvis songs on the radio. During Christmastime, they'd play 'Blue Christmas,' and I knew I liked his songs, but I didn't know who it was singing them. I just knew I liked them... I started reading, watching, and just picking up everything I could about him.": "Drake",
  "I'd sit on the coffee table and lip sync to 'Blue Christmas,' 'I Can't Help Falling in Love,' 'Love Me Tender,' 'Don't Be Cruel' - some of the big hits like that.": "Drake",
  "Christmas... is not an external event at all, but a piece of one's home that one carries in one's heart.": "Freya",
  "Being a traditionalist, I'm a rabid sucker for Christmas. In July, I'm already worried that there are only 146 shopping days left.": "John",
  "Always be prepared if someone asks you what you want for Christmas. Give brand names, the store that sells the merchandise, and, if possible, exact model numbers so they can't go wrong. Be the type who's impossible to buy for, so they have to get what you want.": "John",
  "Several years ago, I was creating a Christmas present for the family, a self-published cookbook featuring recipes my grandmother had collected and created over decades. While interviewing her for the biographical section, she began to talk about her courtship with my late grandfather.": "Kristina",
  "I intend to keep writing Christmas songs. There's still a lot more about Christmas that can be captured and feel like old-time Christmas. A lot of the traditions haven't been explained in song.": "Clint",
  "I don't want to see people decorating a house or digging a garden. As for guys like Jonathan Ross, he got an award there last Christmas. What for? He doesn't sing, dance or tell jokes, does he?": "Ian",
  "In fact, I was one of the few trusted people that Lucy allowed to play with their kids. I spent time at their summer home, rode horses at their ranch, and swam at their beach house. I even spent a Christmas with them at Palm Springs one year.": "Keith",
  "Dad bought me a toy drum one Christmas, and I eventually destroyed it. I wanted a real drum and he bought me a snare drum. Dad continued to buy me one drum after the other.": "Keith",
  "Yes, my first memory of singing, in general, was of a Christmas song. And then listening to Christmas music was really the first music I was ever connected to.": "Christina",
  "It felt very natural to me to write a Christmas song, but at the same time I had to really put all sorts of pressure aside and just let the creativity flow and see what came out.": "Christina",
  "I think it's important not to grow up too fast. I'm 26 now, and I still can't wait for Christmas Day. The inner seven-year-old isn't buried too deeply in me.": "Laura",
  "I know a lot of actors picture themselves winning Academy Awards. I really just wanted to do a Christmas movie because it's the kind of movie that I really love to watch. I'm a sucker for the holidays.": "Leigh-Allyn",
  "Our traditions have been waking up on Christmas morning and feasting on a southern breakfast. I'm from the South. We eat grits and biscuits and gravy and eggs with Ritz crackers and country ham, bacon, you name it.": "Leigh-Allyn",
  "With a track like 'White Christmas,' everybody has done that song in every format you can imagine, so I just looked at the chords at that particular song and what chords would make it work. That's kind of quite a sad song, and I had this idea of someone singing it in the subway, someone who is homeless, old and sad.": "Vince",
  "I went on iTunes and looked at versions of Christmas songs. Everyone has done them!": "Vince",
  "If you look at Christmas movies, there are certain things in them that lend themselves to a 'Harold & Kumar' movie. In particular, the more out-of-this-world things like Santa Claus and flying reindeer.": "Hayden",
  "I love 'Call the Midwife' it's an absolute gem of a programme. Filming the Christmas special and then the second series felt like going back to a boarding school that you really love and is full of friends. ": "Helen",
  "My mother cooked her last Christmas standing rib roast in 1987 and died a few weeks afterward.": "Michelle",
  "On Christmas morning, we always make breakfast, and everyone eats before we open any presents. I make muffins and homemade applesauce, which I don't think anyone likes as much as I do... I just love the way it makes the house smell!": "Laura",
  "I love writing Christmas stories, especially of the historical variety.": "Linda",
  "Every Christmas now for years, I have found myself wondering about the point of the celebration. As the holiday has become more ecumenical and secular, it has lost much of the magic that I remember so fondly from childhood.": "Whitley",
  "I put the copy of 'A Christmas Carol' that my grandfather had first read to me 60 years ago on my desk, and I began to write. The result, for better or for worse, is the 'Christmas Spirits.' I plan to read it to my grandson.": "Whitley",
  "At Christmas play and make good cheer, for Christmas comes but once a year.": "Thomas",
  "I'm one of those people who had Christmas and my birthday always combined, and generally, my birthday was pretty much ignored. But my parents are always good about making some kind of special effort to make me feel like I also have a birthday that exists.": "Noel",
  "What's great about an office Christmas party is that it uncovers and reveals parts of your personality that you didn't see coming.": "Will",
  "We had been to a couple really awkward office Christmas parties, including one at our production company. It's just a really interesting place, an event that hadn't really been captured.": "Will",
  "I wouldn't recommend young kids see 'Speedway Junkie.' It's definitely an age-appropriate movie - dark and realistic and edgy. If young kids want to see me, go see the Christmas movie.": "Jonathan",
  "At school, there was an annual school disco and I'd be standing in my bedroom wondering what to wear for hours on end. Eventually I'd arrive at a decision that was just the most ridiculous costume you could have ever devised - I think it was probably knitted Christmas jumpers on top of buttoned-up white shirts.": "Guy",
  "I do love Christmas, although my wife puts me to shame. She is a huge Christmas fan, so we do love us some Christmas in our house.": "Sebastian",
  "One Christmas I had no money, and so I went home and just, like, wrote a poem; I mean, I didn't write them, but I just handed out poems as Christmas presents. Like, 'Here's a Pablo Neruda poem that really made me think of you.'": "June",
  "My very first acting role was Tiny Tim in 'A Christmas Carol.'": "Leland",
  "I get a little behind during Lent, but it comes out even at Christmas.": "Frank",
  "My Christmases have always just been very simple and about family.": "Julie",
  "'A Christmas Story' has always meant a lot to me personally.": "Peter",
  "I think that it's fun to get the script and open it like a Christmas present. That's 'Alcatraz' or anything that I'm working on. If the groundwork has been laid too much, the surprises aren't there.": "Jeffrey",
  "As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly, when they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky. So up to the house-top the coursers they flew, with the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too.": "Clement",
  "Christmas is a holiday that persecutes the lonely, the frayed, and the rejected.": "Jimmy",
  "Then, when I got in the military, I used to host - even in high school - I hosted the talent shows, and when I was in the military I would host all of our base Christmas parties and stuff.": "Gary",
  "Part of me wants to be married and have everybody around the table for Christmas. But when you're married, your life becomes integrated solely with that person. There are too many characters running around inside me. Maybe they should all be married to somebody different.": "Cindy",
  "Christmas is a huge thing in my family. We usually start decorating the day after Thanksgiving. We spend Christmas Eve with one set of grandparents, and Christmas Day with the other grandparents and our family.": "Samantha",
  "Certainly, nothing would stop me coming home for Christmas, if I can. But I've worked a lot in theatre, and in theatre in New York, we work Christmas Day a lot of the time as well.": "Brian",
  "I once bought my kids a set of batteries for Christmas with a note on it saying, toys not included.": "Bernard",
  "Windows are as essential to office prestige as Christmas is to retailing.": "Enid",
  "I remember as a child, my mother loved Dean Martin. Every Christmas, about the only Christmas album that we were able to listen to was the Dean Martin Christmas album.": "Michael",
  "The aim of education is the knowledge, not of facts, but of values.": "William",
  "We don't stop going to school when we graduate.": "Carol",
  "Life is the most exciting opportunity we have. But we have one shot. You graduate from college once, and that's it. You're going out of that nest. And you have to find that courage that's deep, deep, deep in there. Every step of the way.": "Andrew",
  "You are educated. Your certification is in your degree. You may think of it as the ticket to the good life. Let me ask you to think of an alternative. Think of it as your ticket to change the world.": "Tom",
  "All real education is the architecture of the soul.": "William",
  "A graduation ceremony is an event where the commencement speaker tells thousands of students dressed in identical caps and gowns that 'individuality' is the key to success.": "Robert",
  "The doer alone learneth.": "Friedrich",
  "You know what has made me the happiest I've ever been? Seeing my son and daughter graduate from college. More than wanting them to be educated, I wanted them to be nice people. To see that they have become both is just a wonderful thing.": "Gil",
  "Some people drink from the fountain of knowledge, others just gargle.": "Robert",
  "God will not look you over for medals degrees or diplomas, but for scars.": "Elbert",
  "For good nurture and education implant good constitutions.": "Plato",
  "It is virtually impossible to compete in today's global economy without a college degree.": "Bobby",
  "Mentors provide professional networks, outlets for frustration, college and career counseling, general life advice, and most importantly, an extra voice telling a student they are smart enough and capable enough to cross the stage at graduation and land their first paycheck from a career pathway job.": "Gerald",
  "Yeah, I spent about 20 years in a dorm room. It took me a while to graduate.": "Douglas",
  "For a man to attain to an eminent degree in learning costs him time, watching, hunger, nakedness, dizziness in the head, weakness in the stomach, and other inconveniences.": "Miguel",
  "Graduation speeches force you to reflect. They are about consciousness. Nothing is better than consciousness.": "Bruce",
  "I went to my son's graduation this weekend, and I heard a great quote I've never heard before from Albert Einstein. It was that the greatest danger to the world is not the bad people but it's the good people who don't speak out.": "Hamilton",
  "I took three years off. I differentiated myself from the industry. Found my identity - sort of... I haven't graduated yet. I'm not legitimately educated yet, but maybe one day.": "Claire",
  "I grew up very differently than a lot of other people in my hometown in Mississippi. But I can't imagine my life any other way. I flew home and surprised my best friend at his graduation, and I remember turning to my mom and saying, 'My graduation was so much cooler than this.' I had Melissa Joan Hart give my commencement speech.": "Taylor",
  "I'm not retiring. I am graduating. Today is my graduation day. Retirement means that you'll just go ahead and live on your laurels and surf all day in Oceanside. It ain't going to happen.": "Junior",
  "No graduation speaker will ever tell you that the future is anything but uncertain. It never is. But graduations need not only be obsessed with looking ahead a graduation can be a day on which we turn back and trace our steps to see how we ended up where we are. ": "Taylor",
  "It might be said now that I have the best of both worlds. A Harvard education and a Yale degree.": "John",
  "For students today, only 10 percent of children from working-class families graduate from college by the age of 24 as compared to 58 percent of upper-middle-class and wealthy families.": "Patrick",
  "The idea of winning a doctor's degree gradually assumed the aspect of a great moral struggle, and the moral fight possessed immense attraction for me.": "Elizabeth",
  "After graduation, I wanted to work for 'Sassy', which I loved, but it had folded. So I wound up at 'Seventeen' for three years on staff and two as a contributor, and I wrote these great stories that nobody ever believes 'Seventeen' does. Serious stories for teens about social justice issues - gun control, migrant farm workers.": "Gayle",
  "I've told my children that when I die, to release balloons in the sky to celebrate that I graduated. For me, death is a graduation.": "Elisabeth",
  "The essence of Government is power; and power, lodged as it must be in human hands, will ever be liable to abuse.": "James",
  "I had the luxury of skipping the cabinet meeting to attend my daughter's graduation. So many people don't have the luxury of taking an hour away from the workplace to attend indispensable family commitments. We have to change that dynamic.": "Thomas",
  "I've always been short and stocky. So when I got into repertory theatre after graduation, I found myself doing character roles: because of my deep voice, shape and height, I was playing 40-year-old, 50-year-old roles at the age of 23.": "David",
  "Everybody wants you to do good things, but in a small town you pretty much graduate and get married. Mostly you marry, have children and go to their football games.": "Faith",
  "So in my uncertainty, I went to graduate school and there it all happened.": "Ted",
  "I teach one semester a year, and this year I'm just teaching one course during that semester, a writing workshop for older students in their late 20s and early 30s, people in our graduate program who are already working on a manuscript and trying to bring it to completion.": "Tobias",
  "North Dakota State. What do you have to do there to graduate? Milk a cow with your left hand?": "Bobby",
  "I thought I should go to New York because it was the place to go to study. I went and tried to get an application from the Juilliard School but they wouldn't even give me one because I didn't have my high school graduation.": "Maureen",
  "Upon graduation, believe it or not, I had no job. I had no interviews. I had no prospects. I had no worries. What I did have, I had passion. I had enormous passion. I had passion for financial markets. I had fallen in love with financial markets.": "Gary",
  "I learned law so well, the day I graduated I sued the college, won the case, and got my tuition back.": "Fred",
  "I think about the milestones from my childhood and what it will be like to watch our kids go through them. Taking Riley to her first day of school was a whirlwind. I can't imagine what middle school is going to be like, and high school, and graduation.": "Stephen",
  "Never go to your high school reunion pregnant or they will think that is all you have done since you graduated.": "Erma",
  "This man used to go to school with his dog. Then they were separated. His dog graduated!": "Henny",
  "You are graduating from college. That means that this is the first day of the last day of your life. No, that's wrong. This is the last day of the first day of school. Nope, that's worse. This is a day.": "Andy",
  "Since graduation, I have measured time in 4-by-5-inch pieces of paper, four days on the left and three on the right. Every social engagement, interview, reading, flight, doctor's appointment, birthday and dry-cleaning reminder has been handwritten between metal loops.": "Sloane",
  "At 20, I realized that I could not possibly adjust to a feminine role as conceived by my father and asked him permission to engage in a professional career. In eight months I filled my gaps in Latin, Greek and mathematics, graduated from high school, and entered medical school in Turin.": "Rita",
  "If you're picking your best friend based on what kind of clothes she wears or how popular she is, chances are you aren't going to stay in touch after graduation.": "Renee",
  "From kindergarten to graduation, I went to public schools, and I know that they are a key to being sure that every child has a chance to succeed and to rise in the world.": "Dick",
  "My mother was keen that I complete my graduation and never ever wanted me to be in the movies, as my father had made five films that lost money. One of the films he made was 'Agneepath,' which was hugely hyped but underwhelming at the box office, and I remember that my dad had to sell my grandmother's flat to pay off the loan.": "Karan",
  "Even though I didn't get a business degree, I enjoyed learning about economics.": "Herb",
  "It makes little difference how many university courses or degrees a person may own. If he cannot use words to move an idea from one point to another, his education is incomplete.": "Norman",
  "When I graduated from high school, it was during the Depression and we had no money.": "Ray",
  "I don't look to find an educated person in the ranks of university graduates, necessarily. Some of the most educated people I know have never been near a university.": "John",
  "If a student takes the whole series of my folklore courses including the graduate seminars, he or she should learn something about fieldwork, something about bibliography, something about how to carry out library research, and something about how to publish that research.": "Alan",
  "I woke up on May 15, 1991, the day of my Barnard graduation, and I said to myself, 'By the end of today you will decide what you want to do with the rest of your life.'": "Alexandra",
  "Commencement speeches were invented largely in the belief that outgoing college students should never be released into the world until they have been properly sedated.": "Garry",
  "For many, graduation marks the end of formal student life - the end of long spring breaks and of thinking that a 10 A.M. class is far too early.": "Alexa",
  "Earlier today, Arnold Schwarzenegger criticized the California school system, calling it disastrous. Arnold says California's schools are so bad that its graduates are willing to vote for me.": "Conan",
  "In this outward and physical ceremony we attest once again to the inner and spiritual strength of our Nation. As my high school teacher, Miss Julia Coleman, used to say: 'We must adjust to changing times and still hold to unchanging principles.'": "Jimmy",
  "College atheletes used to get a degree in bringing your pencil.": "Ruby",
  "Even though I disagree with many of the changes, when I see the privates graduate at the end of the day, when they walk off that drill field at the end of the ceremony, they are still fine privates; outstanding, well motivated privates.": "R.",
  "One of the first times I ever performed in front of a big group of people was at my kindergarten graduation. I did, like, a Michael Jackson impersonation as, like, a five year old.

  "Positive thinking is the notion that if you think good thoughts, things will work out well. Optimism is the feeling of thinking things will be well and be hopeful.": "Martin",
  "The job market of the future will consist of those jobs that robots cannot perform. Our blue-collar work is pattern recognition, making sense of what you see.

When I started as an actor, because of the accent and my body and my personality, it was not what the stereotype of the Latina woman in Hollywood is, so they didn't know where to put me. The blond hair wasn't matching. The moment I put my hair dark, it was better for my work.": "Sofia",
  "The world is being re-shaped by the convergence of social, mobile, cloud, big data, community and other powerful forces. The combination of these technologies unlocks an incredible opportunity to connect everything together in a new way and is dramatically transforming the way we live and work.": "Marc",
  "My work is all about adventure and teamwork in some of the most inhospitable jungles, mountains and deserts on the planet. If you aren't able to look after yourself and each other, then people die.": "Bear",
  "Of all the things I've done, the most vital is coordinating those who work with me and aiming their efforts at a certain goal.": "Walt",
  "I love to watch the movement of light on water, and I love to play in rivers and lakes, swimming or canoeing. I am fascinated by people who work with water - fishermen, boatmen - and by a way of life that is dominated by water.": "Berlie",
  "I have learned that raising children is the single most difficult thing in the world to do. It takes hard work, love, luck, and a lot of energy, and it is the most rewarding experience that you can ever have.": "Janet",
  "Learning should be engaging. Testing should not be the be all and end all. All students should have a broad curriculum that includes the arts and enrichment. Students should have opportunities to work in teams and engage in project-based learning. And student and family well-being should be front and center.": "Randi",
  "While we see the course of the final abolition of human slavery is onward, & we give it the aid of our prayers & all justifiable means in our power, we must leave the progress as well as the result in his hands who sees the end; who chooses to work by slow influences; & with whom two thousand years are but as a single day.": "Robert",
  "I think goals should never be easy, they should force you to work, even if they are uncomfortable at the time.": "Michael",
  "What a piece of work is a man, how noble in reason, how infinite in faculties, in form and moving how express and admirable, in action how like an angel, in apprehension how like a god.": "William",
  "Don't do anything by half. If you love someone, love them with all your soul. When you go to work, work your ass off. When you hate someone, hate them until it hurts.": "Henry",
  "Cooking is in an honest profession where you cannot hide and let others do the work for you. You have to show up, work hard and prove you can do it faster and better. And find a mentor who will recognize your talent and push you in the right direction.": "Marcus",

  "If you look around, complacency is the great disease of your autumn years, and I work hard to prevent that.": "Nick",

  "Some things is made by destiny, yes, other things by hard work, but quality you don't learn. Quality you are born with.": "Zlatan",
  "The only way to get love is to be lovable. It's very irritating if you have a lot of money. You'd like to think you could write a check: 'I'll buy a million dollars' worth of love.' But it doesn't work that way. The more you give love away, the more you get.": "Warren",
  "Imagine having all of your freedoms taken away, being forced to work against your will, and constantly living under the threat of violence - in short, being forced to live as a slave. Sadly, this situation is a reality for millions of children, women, and men each year as part of the global human trafficking industry.": "Bill",

  "Life is a series of baby steps along the way and if you add up these tiny little steps you take toward your goal, whatever it is, whether it's giving up something, a terrible addiction or trying to work your way through an illness. When you total up those baby steps you'd be amazed over the course of 10 years, the strides you've taken.": "Hoda",
  "The one way to get me to work my hardest was to doubt me.": "Michelle",

  "Confidence doesn't come out of nowhere. It's a result of something... hours and days and weeks and years of constant work and dedication.": "Roger",
  "You aren't your work, your accomplishments, your possessions, your home, your family... your anything. You're a creation of your Source, dressed in a physical human body intended to experience and enjoy life on Earth.": "Wayne",

  "The things that have always been important: to be a good man, to try to live my life the way God would have me, to turn it over to Him that His will might be worked in my life, to do my work without looking back, to give it all I've got, and to take pride in my work as an honest performer.": "Johnny",
  "Human rights must work to uplift human dignity.": "Rodrigo",
  "I'm not interested in trying to work on people's perceptions. I am who I am, and if you don't take the time to learn about that, then your perception is going to be your problem.": "Jim",
  "All my big mistakes are when I try to second-guess or please an audience. My work is always stronger when I get very selfish about it.": "David",
  "Organizing ahead of time makes the work more enjoyable. Chefs cut up the onions and have the ingredients lined up ahead of time and have them ready to go. When everything is organized you can clean as you go and it makes everything so much easier and fun.": "Anne",
  "I prefer to work with grey characters rather than black and white.": "George",
  "If you are good at studies, and you want to play cricket, you may work harder than any other person, but you may not achieve it.

  "Be proud of your Latino culture and do the best work you can do, and you will always succeed.": "Lionel",
  "When radium was discovered, no one knew that it would prove useful in hospitals. The work was one of pure science. And this is a proof that scientific work must not be considered from the point of view of the direct usefulness of it.": "Marie",
  "I want the kids to know that it's not a myth that somebody from their city plays and wins in the NBA. I just want to influence them to work hard and do whatever they want to do in life, whether it's to be a basketball player or scientist... if they believe in themselves, they can do anything.": "Kawhi",

  "I started as a black and white photographer, but the colors I was seeing were just so lurid and compelling and awful at the same time. They got me looking at other contemporary art. I was gravitating more and more toward work that had visceral power, that wasn't necessarily about being beautiful but had some kind of horror in the palette.": "David",
  "We need to inspire and give each other confidence so that the work we do will be fruitful for the well-being of the people and the stability and security of the country.": "Bhumibol",
  "No one can come and claim ownership of my work. I am the creator of it, and it lives within me.": "Prince",

  "I guess we all like to be recognized not for one piece of fireworks, but for the ledger of our daily work.": "Neil",
  "I do not write for this generation. I am writing for other ages. If this could read me, they would burn my books, the work of my whole life. On the other hand, the generation which interprets these writings will be an educated generation; they will understand me and say: 'Not all were asleep in the nighttime of our grandparents.'": "Jose",

  "It was my father who taught us that an immigrant must work twice as hard as anybody else, that he must never give up.": "Zinedine",
  "In the end it's about the work, not an award you get for the work.": "Linda",
  "Learning something new is a fabulous way to be refreshed. When work can grind you down, something about learning a new activity thrills the soul. It reminds you that the world is bigger than your desk and your to-do list.": "John",
  "If you have a group of people come together around a vision for real discipleship, people who are committed to grow, committed to change, committed to learn, then a spiritual assessment tool can work.": "Dallas",

  "My scientific studies have afforded me great gratification and I am convinced that it will not be long before the whole world acknowledges the results of my work. ": "Gregor",
  "Don't try to be somebody you're not because it doesn't work. If you try to be this perfect person or perfect persona of what you think that somebody should be when they're involved in public office, it's just not going to work. Just be yourself, stay true to your core values, and really just stay abreast of the issues.": "Ben",

  "In terms of instilling the values of mental toughness and work ethic, discipline is the gift that keeps on giving.": "William",
  "It's the ultimate goal every day you wake up, to be happy. At the end of the week, you want to be happy. Happy in love, happy in work, happy in life, happy with yourself. It's pretty simple.": "Pierce",
  "From the very first, it has been the educated and intelligent of the Negro people that have led and elevated the mass, and the sole obstacles that nullified and retarded their efforts were slavery and race prejudice; for what is slavery but the legalized survival of the unfit and the nullification of the work of natural internal leadership?": "W.",
  "I understand what's it like to work all week and on Friday night just want to go and leave your brain at the door, buy some popcorn and be thrilled by something.": "Don",
  "Once Canadians no longer believe that there is any good in politics, they no longer feel we can work together to solve the challenges we're facing, and that is my fundamental motivation: how do we work together as a country to solve the big challenges we're facing.": "Justin",
  "Good leadership consists of showing average people how to do the work of superior people.": "John",
  "You have to find what makes you stable in the storm. Then, no matter what's happening round you, no matter what the hype or the publicity, you can still manage to make leaps in your work as an artist.": "Jimmy",
  "All you can do is really the prep work and make sure you're ready to hit each golf shot. Outside of that, you're not sure really what's going to happen. It's a funny game, but I think that's why I love it. You never know, one day to the next; you could go shoot 62, and the next day you're going to shoot 78, and you can't predict it.": "Rickie",
  "I've found that the people who play villains are the nicest people in the world, and people who play heroes are jerks. It's like people who play villains work out all their problems on screen, and then they're just really wonderful people.": "Tim",
  "I'm coming to this world not to work. I want to come to this world to enjoy my life. I don't want to die in my office. I want to die on the beaches.": "Jack",
  "Jazz, to me, is one of the inherent expressions of Negro life in America: the eternal tom-tom beating in the Negro soul - the tom-tom of revolt against weariness in a white world, a world of subway trains, and work, work, work; the tom-tom of joy and laughter, and pain swallowed in a smile.": "Langston",
  "For me, education has never been simply a policy issue - it's personal. Neither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country.": "Michelle",
  "What being a socialist means is... that you hold out... a vision of society where poverty is absolutely unnecessary, where international relations are not based on greed... but on cooperation... where human beings can own the means of production and work together rather than having to work as semi-slaves to other people who can hire and fire.": "Bernie",
  "Nothing is work unless you'd rather be doing something else.": "George",
  "The scientific man does not aim at an immediate result. He does not expect that his advanced ideas will be readily taken up. His work is like that of the planter - for the future. His duty is to lay the foundation for those who are to come, and point the way.": "Nikola",
  "One of the main lessons I have learned during my five years as Secretary-General is that broad partnerships are the key to solving broad challenges. When governments, the United Nations, businesses, philanthropies and civil society work hand-in-hand, we can achieve great things.": "Ban",
  "Representation of the world, like the world itself, is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with the absolute truth.": "Simone",
  "I like being the underdog so they don't expect what's going to happen. It pushes me to work harder and do the things I'm not doing better.": "Kawhi",
  "My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work, give me the most abstruse cryptogram, or the most intricate analysis, and I am in my own proper atmosphere. But I abhor the dull routine of existence. I crave for mental exaltation.": "Arthur",
  "It behooves every man to remember that the work of the critic is of altogether secondary importance, and that, in the end, progress is accomplished by the man who does things.": "Theodore",
  "There is joy in work. There is no happiness except in the realization that we have accomplished something.": "Henry",
  "Bring diversity back to agriculture. That's what made it work in the first place.": "David",

  "All labor that uplifts humanity has dignity and importance and should be undertaken with painstaking excellence.": "Martin",
  "Making a record? You've got to have the song, then you create a record. I think it's the same with a live performance. If the material is strong, you're already 90% there. I always tell young people it's all about the music, the songs. Work on the songs, work on the songs, work on the songs.": "Tom",
  "If you're not willing to work, you're never going to be able to experience the American Dream.": "Jim",

  "Live your life, do your work, then take your hat.": "Henry",
  "I had a stick of CareFree gum, but it didn't work. I felt pretty good while I was blowing that bubble, but as soon as the gum lost its flavor, I was back to pondering my mortality.": "Mitch",
  "A relationship is work, and it changes. And you go with the changes. It's more good times than bad times, but it's not always good. You have to overcome those issues and move on.": "David",
  "When you fail you learn from the mistakes you made and it motivates you to work even harder.": "Natalie",
  "A woman can be demure, lady-like and the most prim and proper character, and still have a toughness and resiliency as apparent as a superhero-type female character or a warrior or soldier type. It's all about the story, the character, and the course of events in that piece of work and how that character is presented.": "Katherine",
  "I prioritize in life. I like to work, I do TV shows, I do a lot of Iron Man training. I enjoy kicking back on a good night and drinking wine until I go to bed, and having fun with my friends. You just have to make time for it and keep it balanced.": "Joe",
  "Running is a great metaphor for life. You set a goal, and then you get to work. How well you do is a direct reflection of how hard you work. It's a mental game, too. There are setbacks along the way, but the true test of a runner is how you overcome and push past them.": "Ivanka",
  "Community service has taught me all kinds of skills and increased my confidence. You go out there and think on your feet, work with others and create something from nothing. That's what life's all about.": "Andrew",
  "No self-respecting woman should wish or work for the success of a party who ignores her sex.": "Susan",
  "Coal mining is an industry rife with mismanagement, corruption, greed and an almost blatant disregard for the safety, health and quality of life of its work force. Everyone knows this. Everyone has always known it.": "Tawni",

  "Work is the meat of life, pleasure the dessert.": "B.",
  "When I decided to be a musician I reckoned that that was going to be the way of less profit, less money. I was sort of giving up the idea of making a lot of money. It was what I loved to do. I would have done it anyway. If I'd had to work at Taco Bell I'd have still been out at night trying to play music.": "Tom",
  "In every community, there is work to be done. In every nation, there are wounds to heal. In every heart, there is the power to do it.": "Marianne",
  "When leaders know how to lead great meetings, there's less time wasted and less frustration. We have more energy to do the work that matters, realize our full potential, and do great things.": "Justin",
  "I have always loved to use fear, to take it and comprehend it and make it work and consolidate a situation where I was afraid and take it whole and work from there.": "Shirley",
  "When you see a fashion show, you see those seven minutes of what was six months of tedious work of, you know, going up an inch and down an inch, changing it from one shade of red to another shade of red. So it's the same as any creative process. The result is what we see, but the process is really labor intensive and work.": "Marc",
  "I think leadership is more than just being able to cross the t's and dot the i's. It's about character and integrity and work ethic.": "Steve",
  "It is impossible to work in information technology without also engaging in social engineering.": "Jaron",
  "I think the importance of doing activist work is precisely because it allows you to give back and to consider yourself not as a single individual who may have achieved whatever but to be a part of an ongoing historical movement.": "Angela",
  "When I was a kid I used to pray every night for a new bicycle. Then I realised that the Lord doesn't work that way so I stole one and asked Him to forgive me.": "Emo",
  "Reality is easy. It's deception that's the hard work.": "Lauryn",
  "I don't think your personal life has anything to do with your professional life. They are separate things. Whatever is happening at home shouldn't be carried to work. Everyone has his/her own journey. Some revel in the fact that they derive that from personal contentment, and others draw it from extreme sorrow.": "Abhishek",
  "Balance provides the chance for longevity. You can be a champion at work and at home.": "Tony",
  "You can achieve anything you put your mind and hard work to.": "Sara",
  "I'm a victim of my own insides. There was a time when I wanted to know everything. It used to make me very unhappy, all that feeling. I just didn't know what to do with it. But now I've learned to make that feeling work for me.": "Janis",
  "The highest compliment that you can pay me is to say that I work hard every day, that I never dog it.": "Wayne",

  "When you're not concerned with succeeding, you can work with complete freedom.": "Larry",
  "If you're not willing to work hard, let someone else do it. I'd rather be with someone who does a horrible job, but gives 110% than with someone who does a good job and gives 60%.": "Will",

  "Hard work always pays off, whatever you do.": "Dustin",
  "My biggest success is getting over the things that have tried to destroy and take me out of this life. Those are my biggest successes. It has nothing to do with work.": "Tyler",
  "I try to not work too many Sundays. At least on Sunday nights, I try to chill out a little bit. I call it Sunday Funday.": "Miley",
  "Relationships have to have a give and take if they're going to work in the long term.": "Shakira",
  "I'm proud of 'Fifty Shades of Grey.' I don't need to distance myself from that. The more work I do, the more the general public sees the different things I can do. Do I think it opened doors? Yeah. More people know my name.": "Dakota",

  "It's a great feeling when your work is appreciated.": "Jacqueline",
  "Preparation is a mentality... With wrestling being my background, I've always learned to overwork, overwork. Work, work, work, work. It's not always the talented that wins, but it's the one who puts in the most preparation and thought into things.": "Dominick",
  "Tell the truth, work hard, and come to dinner on time.": "Gerald",
  "Understanding that being nervous, having doubts and lacking confidence are emotions that are human is how you deal with it. It is okay to feel that way... and then understanding that you can work through it.": "Venus",
  "The average person puts only 25% of his energy and ability into his work. The world takes off its hat to those who put in more than 50% of their capacity, and stands on its head for those few and far between souls who devote 100%.": "Andrew",
  "I kept on trying to use so many media and ideas in my work because our horizon is so vast and Indian culture is so rich that I think what we are today, culturally, we have a unique position and I don't think one lifetime is enough to encompass it.": "M.",
  "People don't understand that when I grew up, I was never the most talented. I was never the biggest. I was never the fastest. I certainly was never the strongest. The only thing I had was my work ethic, and that's been what has gotten me this far.": "Tiger",
  "Across professions, consistency is a direct product of work ethic.": "Harsha",
  "Keep the circus going inside you, keep it going, don't take anything too seriously, it'll all work out in the end.": "David",
  "My focus had always been the on-side. My coach wanted me to work on the offside strokes since he was convinced of my ability and timing on the leg side. I worked hard and firmed up my defensive technique. I am happy getting runs all around the wicket now, and getting a lot of boundaries. No one calls me a 'leggie batsman' anymore.": "Virat",
  "A beautiful lady is an accident of nature. A beautiful old lady is a work of art.": "Louis",
  "For me, every day is a new thing. I approach each project with a new insecurity, almost like the first project I ever did. And I get the sweats. I go in and start working, I'm not sure where I'm going. If I knew where I was going I wouldn't do it.": "Frank",
  "Europe and Africa share proximity and history, ideas and ideals, trade and technology. You are tied together by the ebb and flow of people.

  "We are infected by our own misunderstanding of how our own minds work.": "Kevin",
  "My mother's dad dropped out of the eighth grade to work. He had to. By the time he was 30, he was a master electrician, plumber, carpenter, mason, mechanic. That guy was, to me, a magician. Anything that was broken, he could fix. Anybody anywhere in our community knew that if there was a problem, Carl was there to fix it.": "Mike",

  "One of the great lessons the fall of the leaf teaches, is this: do your work well and then be ready to depart when God shall call.": "Tryon",
  "Work is that which you dislike doing but perform for the sake of external rewards. At school, this takes the form of grades. In society, it means money, status, privilege.": "Abraham",

  "Like all technology, social media is neutral but is best put to work in the service of building a better world.": "Simon",
  "I don't think that you can invent on behalf of customers unless you're willing to think long-term, because a lot of invention doesn't work. If you're going to invent, it means you're going to experiment, and if you're going to experiment, you're going to fail, and if you're going to fail, you have to think long term.": "Jeff",
  "All I was doing was trying to get home from work.": "Rosa",

  "Don't think that there's a different, better child 'hiding' behind the autism. This is your child. Love the child in front of you. Encourage his strengths, celebrate his quirks, and improve his weaknesses, the way you would with any child. You may have to work harder on some of this, but that's the goal.": "Claire",

  "We already have - thanks to technology, development, skills, the efficiency of our work - enough resources to satisfy all human needs. But we don't have enough resources, and we are unlikely ever to have, to satisfy human greed.": "Zygmunt",
  "I think what's important in a good manager and a good agent is that they know your vision and that they are passionate about you and believe in you. Because if they don't, then they're not going to work hard for you, and they're going to send you out on things that you don't want to do.": "Maiara",
  "For me, the most interesting people are ones who often work against their best interests. Bad choices. They go in directions where you go, 'No no no nooo!' You push away someone who is trying to love you, you hurt someone who's trying to get your trust, or you love someone you shouldn't.": "Paul",

  "Begin - to begin is half the work, let half still remain; again begin this, and thou wilt have finished.": "Marcus",
  "What is sad for women of my generation is that they weren't supposed to work if they had families. What were they going to do when the children are grown - watch the raindrops coming down the window pane?": "Jackie",
  "Results! Why, man, I have gotten a lot of results. I know several thousand things that won't work.": "Thomas",
  "Fires can't be made with dead embers, nor can enthusiasm be stirred by spiritless men. Enthusiasm in our daily work lightens effort and turns even labor into pleasant tasks.": "James",
  "The cardinal responsibility of leadership is to identify the dominant contradiction at each point of the historical process and to work out a central line to resolve it.": "Mao",
  "If you go to work on your goals, your goals will go to work on you. If you go to work on your plan, your plan will go to work on you. Whatever good things we build end up building us.": "Jim",

  "I enjoy going to work and having a good time. It's tough when you got to work with people who just are in a bad mood all the damn time.": "Queen",
  "To survive, you've got to keep wheedling your way. You can't just sit there and fight against odds when it's not going to work. You have to turn a corner, dig a hole, go through a tunnel - and find a way to keep moving.": "Twyla",
  "Introverts are more effective leaders of proactive employees. When you have a creative, energetic work force, an introvert is going to draw out that energy better.": "Laurie",
  "The love of what you do, combined with your belief in what you do, will not determine your success. It will determine how hard you will work and how dedicated you will be to achieving it. Success just shows up from there.": "Jeffrey",
  "Nothing is more dangerous to one's own faith than the work of an apologist. No doctrine of that faith seems to me so spectral, so unreal as one that I have just successfully defended in a public debate.": "C.",
  "People's blessings give you the power to work tirelessly. The only thing required is commitment.": "Narendra",
  "How real can your music be if you wake up in the morning hearing birds and crickets? I never hear birds when I wake up.

  "Man was made at the end of the week's work, when God was tired.": "Mark",
  "Our thoughts are mainly controlled by our subconscious, which is largely formed before the age of 6, and you cannot change the subconscious mind by just thinking about it. That's why the power of positive thinking will not work for most people. The subconscious mind is like a tape player. Until you change the tape, it will not change.": "Bruce",
  "The travel, the amazing work I have had the chance to do, the meetings with different people are all very inspiring and give me lots of positive energy.": "Saskia",

  "Anybody who has been seriously engaged in scientific work of any kind realizes that over the entrance to the gates of the temple of science are written the words: 'Ye must have faith.'": "Max",
  "Capitalism is an organized system to guarantee that greed becomes the primary force of our economic system and allows the few at the top to get very wealthy and has the rest of us riding around thinking we can be that way, too - if we just work hard enough, sell enough Tupperware and Amway products, we can get a pink Cadillac.": "Michael",

  "The important thing is to do good work, no matter what medium you do it in.": "Roy",
  "I like work/life separation, not work/life balance. What I mean by that is, if I'm on, I want to be on and maximally productive. If I'm off, I don't want to think about work. When people strive for work/life balance, they end up blending them. That's how you end up checking email all day Saturday.": "Timothy",

  "Mediocre men work at their best men seeking excellence strive to do better. ": "Edwin",
  "In journalism just one fact that is false prejudices the entire work. In contrast, in fiction one single fact that is true gives legitimacy to the entire work. That's the only difference, and it lies in the commitment of the writer. A novelist can do anything he wants so long as he makes people believe in it.": "Gabriel",
  "Good social media is authentic. What makes social media work is actually having something to say.": "Steven",
  "I work very hard, and I play very hard. I'm grateful for life. And I live it - I believe life loves the liver of it. I live it.": "Maya",
  "Personally, I don't take holidays; I go on trips. My idea of relaxing is taking a trip that isn't commissioned. I'll work just as hard, but without that nagging pressure of fulfilling a commission. Now that's what I call a holiday.": "Martin",
  "A little less complaint and whining, and a little more dogged work and manly striving, would do us more credit than a thousand civil rights bills.": "W.",
  "Only true love can fuel the hard work that awaits you.": "Tom",
  "Lend your ears to music, open your eyes to painting, and... stop thinking! Just ask yourself whether the work has enabled you to 'walk about' into a hitherto unknown world. If the answer is yes, what more do you want?": "Wassily",

  "For newcomers, modelling is like a stepping stone to acting. The exposure and experience in modelling helps... But for acting, we have to show a lot of hard work and dedication towards it.": "Rakul",
  "To fulfill a dream, to be allowed to sweat over lonely labor, to be given a chance to create, is the meat and potatoes of life. The money is the gravy.": "Bette",

  "The only thing that overcomes hard luck is hard work.": "Harry",

  "Luck? I don't know anything about luck. I've never banked on it and I'm afraid of people who do. Luck to me is something else: Hard work - and realizing what is opportunity and what isn't.": "Lucille",

  "Work, look for peace and calm in work: you will find it nowhere else.": "Dmitri",
  "If there's any message to my work, it is ultimately that it's OK to be different, that it's good to be different, that we should question ourselves before we pass judgment on someone who looks different, behaves different, talks different, is a different color.": "Johnny",
  "Since I was a little girl, I have witnessed the strength and courage that energized my mother, who left every sorrow and pain in the past, who would work unyieldingly to obtain her goals, who was the great warrior from whom I learned all the values that are today fundamental pillars of my every day.": "Thalia",
  "Our work is never over.": "Kanye",
  "I'm the luckiest guy in the world. I never really had a job. I was a football player, then a football coach, then a football broadcaster. It's been my life. Pro football has been my life since 1967. I've enjoyed every part of it. Never once did it ever feel like work.": "John",

  "Wherever smart people work, doors are unlocked.": "Steve",
  "I would say the most satisfying thing actually is watching my three children each pick up on their own interests and work many more hours per week than most people that have jobs at trying to intelligently give away that money in fields that they particularly care about.": "Warren",
  "Words have life and must be cared for. If they are stolen for ugly uses or careless slang or false promotion work, they need to be brought back to their original meaning - back to their roots.": "Corita",
  "Everyone has a different body shape, so you kind of have to figure out not only what works best for your body type, but what also makes you feel confident. Even if everyone thinks you look good in a bikini, and you don't feel good in it, you're not going to be at your best. If you feel great in a bikini, you can always work it.": "Gigi",
  "Great work is done by people who are not afraid to be great.": "Fernando",

  "The three ordinary things that we often don't pay enough attention to, but which I believe are the drivers of all success, are hard work, perseverance, and basic honesty.": "Azim",
  "Every device there is in language is there to be used, if you will. Poets have got to enjoy themselves sometimes, and the twistings and convolutions of words, the inventions and contrivances, are all part of the joy that is part of the painful, voluntary work.": "Dylan",
  "Our highly qualified teachers not only work hard, but they care about each and every student that enters their classroom. I thank you, Montana teachers, for your sense of duty and compassion to our precious future generation.": "Conrad",

  "Capitalism invariably boils down to barter between two willing parties, neither of whom uses force to work with the other.": "Ben",
  "There's a snobbery at work in architecture. The subject is too often treated as a fine art, delicately wrapped in mumbo-jumbo. In reality, it's an all-embracing discipline taking in science, art, maths, engineering, climate, nature, politics, economics.": "Norman",
  "Unemployment insurance, abolishing child labor, the 40-hour work week, collective bargaining, strong banking regulations, deposit insurance, and job programs that put millions of people to work were all described, in one way or another, as 'socialist.' Yet, these programs have become the fabric of our nation and the foundation of the middle class.": "Bernie",

He's from strong, Presbyterian Scottish working-class stock, and he used to sit me down and say, 'You know, 99 percent of actors are out of work.

  "It feels good to have your work respected again.": "Eminem",
  "You see, without hard work and responsibility, there is no American Dream. Hard work lays the foundation. Our solidarity makes work pay - for all of us. For the greater good. That's what our vision of shared prosperity is all about.": "Richard",
  "A lot of people think Formula One isn't a sport because everyone drives a car when they go to work in the morning. But we're pulling up to six G on a corner or during breaking, which is almost like being a fighter pilot. So we have to do a lot of work on our neck muscles.": "Jenson",

  "Curves are the essence of my work because they are the essence of Brazil, pure and simple.": "Oscar",
  "In the end, we know what makes us happy. We also know what makes us unhappy. That's the irony. We know and yet we still mess it up. That's part of the human condition, no, and why we need to work on it.": "Harlan",

  "Taking dishes straight off the restaurant's menu and putting them into a cookbook doesn't work, because as a chef you have your own vision of what your food is, but you can't always explain it. Or you can't pick recipes that best illustrate who and where you are and what you're doing. And if the recipes don't work, you don't have a book.": "Marcus",

  "When people say they prefer organic food, what they often seem to mean is they don't want their food tainted with pesticides and their meat shot full of hormones or antibiotics.

It's been a real design-thinking approach to innovation, which we've learned an awful lot from.": "Jorgen",
  "Famous people are deceptive. Deep down, they're just regular people. Like Larry King. We've been friends for forty years. He's one of the few guys I know who's really famous. One minute he's talking to the president on his cell phone, and then the next minute he's saying to me, 'Do you think we ought to give the waiter another dollar?'": "Don",
  "I'm bored with that line. I never use it anymore. My new line is 'In 15 minutes everybody will be famous.'": "Andy",
  "When someone becomes successful or rich and famous, people perceive that person as being different. But I'm the same guy I've always been.": "Barry",
  "The scientists I looked up to at the beginning were not Latino. They were famous scientists of many years ago, like Madame Curie. Later, I realized that there were also, but a very few, Latino scientists. There were good ones, but very few, because there wasn't as much a tradition to be a scientist in our culture. But this is changing.": "Mario",
  "I was definitely not the kid that just wanted to be famous for no reason whatsoever and then happened to find comedy. Fame and all that stuff have always been slightly terrifying to me, and it makes me very anxious.": "Bo",
  "Don't worry about writing a book or getting famous or making money. Just lead an interesting life.": "Michael",
  "In the beginning, I loved being famous, but now I am tired of it and I would like to go back to my freedom.": "Roberto",
  "I'm more interested in being good than being famous.": "Annie",
  "To be famous, in fact, one has only to kill one's landlady.": "Albert",
  "People think being famous is so glamorous, but half the time you're in a strange hotel room living out of a suitcase.": "Ja",
  "When you become famous, being famous becomes your profession.": "James",
  "Celebrity is the chastisement of merit and the punishment of talent.": "Emily",
  "We all want to be famous people, and the moment we want to be something we are no longer free.": "Jiddu",
  "For a time, at least, I was the most famous person in the entire world.": "Jesse",
  "Fame is the thirst of youth.": "Lord",
  "I imagined being a famous writer would be like being like Jane Austen.": "J.",
  "Public misbehavior by the famous is a powerful teaching tool.": "Bill",
  "The whole celebrity culture thing - I'm fascinated by, and repelled by, and yet I end up knowing about it.": "Anderson",
  "Celebrity means that I can affect people in a positive way.": "David",
  "It's really easy to avoid the tabloids. You just live your life and don't hang out with famous people who are in the tabloids. Don't do anything controversial and be a normal person. Have friends. And get a job and keep working.": "Amanda",
  "Everybody think they're famous when they get 100,000 followers on Instagram and 5,000 on Twitter.": "Meek",
  "On Sunday morning, it's Brooklyn Bagels on Beverly Boulevard. We get them hot. Then we walk some of the famous Silver Lake steps or hike in the hills to the highest vantage point to see the reservoir.": "Jill",
  "My family's lineage, we are warriors. The McGregor clan, we are warriors all through. We are famous all through the world for our fighting capabilities of all generations. So I have no doubt that's stood to me and that led me down this path and gave me what I have.": "Conor",
  "One of the downsides of being famous is that folks pay far more attention to you than they should. American celebrities are constantly under surveillance, and every word they say is subject to scrutiny. So, be careful what you wish for if you desire fame. No human being should be a goldfish.": "Bill",
  "There's a famous slogan here in the Bavarian dialect, and we use it inside Bayern Munich. We say, 'Mia san mia.' Literally, it is, 'We are we,' but it means, 'We are who we are.' That's not being very arrogant, but we are very confident about our ability to win the game. It is about a winning mentality.": "Bastian",
  "I once wrote that Lord Moran, Churchill's doctor, had doctored his diaries as well as his famous patient. That was true but unfair. Although their authenticity as contemporary, daily accounts is often questionable, the observations are quite wonderful.": "Nigel",
  "People like consistency. Whether it's a store or a restaurant, they want to come in and see what you are famous for.": "Mickey",
  "The problem for us, as viewers, is that we want famous people who are passionate about the things they're famous for, because that makes them worthy of the attention. But I think many of those famous people just want to be famous.": "Bo",
  "It is difficult to be famous and that successful where you can't even walk down the street without people chasing you, and having people build monuments to you and worshiping you - all that stuff - but I never took that to a place where I believed it. I saw it as being temporary and a phase.": "David",
  "Powerful women intimidate men. If she's a really well-known woman, she has a career, she's famous - in that case, men are really afraid.": "Donatella",
  "I didn't want kids to think that to be happy, they had to be famous or rich or live in the big city.": "Dan",
  "I always want to say to people who want to be rich and famous: 'try being rich first'. See if that doesn't cover most of it. There's not much downside to being rich, other than paying taxes and having your relatives ask you for money. But when you become famous, you end up with a 24-hour job.": "Bill",
  "I never wanted to be famous. I only wanted to be great.": "Ray",
  "I don't want to be famous. I like to be able to sit in a cafe and watch the world go by and observe people.": "Sophia",
  "Being famous is having the power to really implement positive change in the world, and it gives you the power to do what you want. I'm really grateful for it because I can play music and people will listen.": "Sean",
  "There's no difference between fame and infamy now. There's a new school of professional famous people that don't do anything. They don't create anything.": "Ricky",
  "Wood burns because it has the proper stuff in it and a man becomes famous because he has the proper stuff in him. ": "Johann",
  "Fame is like caviar, you know - it's good to have caviar but not when you have it at every meal.": "Marilyn",
  "I have no use for people who throw their weight around as celebrities, or for those who fawn over you just because you are famous.": "Walt",
  "I never wanted to be a celebrity; I never wanted to be famous. And in my daily life, I work really hard to not trade on it in any way.": "Sarah",
  "A famous person to themselves, they don't get up in the morning and think, I'm famous. I'm not famous to me. Famous is a perception.": "Van",
  "I woke up one morning to find I was famous. I bought a white Rolls-Royce and drove down Sunset Boulevard, wearing dark specs and a white suit, waving like the Queen Mum.": "Peter",
  "Power is not of a man. Wealth does not center in the person of the wealthy. Celebrity is not inherent in any personality. To be celebrated, to be wealthy, to have power requires access to major institutions.": "C.",
  "I like being famous when it's convenient for me and completely anonymous when it's not.": "Catherine",
  "Being famous is not something that would make me feel successful - unless one was striving for mediocrity.": "William",
  "The thing about being famous is, it's weird. The only people who get how weird it is are other famous people.": "Margot",
  "How many famous and high-spirited heroes have lived a day too long?": "Jean-Jacques",
  "The strangest part about being famous is you don't get to give first impressions anymore. Everyone already has an impression of you before you meet them.": "Kristen",
  "There is no fulfillment in things whatsoever. And I think one of the reasons that depression reigns supreme amongst the rich and famous is some of them thought that maybe those things would bring them happiness. But what, in fact, does is having a cause, having a passion. And that's really what gives life's true meaning.": "Ben",
  "John Muir, the famous naturalist, wrote in his journal that you should never go to Alaska as a young man because you'll never be satisfied with any other place as long as you live. And there's a lot of truth to that.": "Tom",
  "When I started out, I didn't have any desire to be an actress or to learn how to act. I just wanted to be famous.": "Katharine",
  "I'm actually about as famous as a fourth division footballer from the 70s.": "Dylan",
  "Since I was seventeen I thought I might be a star. I'd think about all my heroes, Charlie Parker, Jimi Hendrix... I had a romantic feeling about how these people became famous.": "Jean-Michel",
  "I think in the end, when you're famous, people like to narrow you down to a few personality traits. I think I've just become this ambitious, say-whatever's-on-her-mind, intimidating person. And that's part of my personality, but it's certainly not anywhere near the whole thing.": "Madonna",
  "I remember being superyoung, like nine or ten years old, and thinking, 'Man, I wonder what famous people eat for breakfast. They must have some special kind of cereal!' My mind was so warped by the idea of fame.": "Bo",
  "I seldom read anything that is not of a factual nature because I want to invest my time wisely in the things that will improve my life. Don't misunderstand; there is nothing wrong with reading purely for the joy of it. Novels have their place, but biographies of famous men and women contain information that can change lives.": "Zig",
  "Neil Armstrong was no Christopher Columbus. In most respects, he was better. Unlike the famous fifteenth century seafarer, Armstrong knew where he landed. He also spent his time in public service, not in jail, and his passing was marked by world-wide encomiums. He ended his days as a celebrated explorer rather than a royal inconvenience.": "Seth",
  "I think people I'm close to find it absolutely crazy that I'm famous.": "Zayn",
  "I've got a nice collection of paintings - a Basquiat, a black-and-white Warhol that's like a Rorschach test, and I commissioned Takashi Murakami to do a ten-foot joint for me. It's almost like the explosion in Hiroshima with his famous skeleton head. There's a wall above my fireplace reserved for it.": "Jay-Z",
  "I was never very interested in boys - and there were plenty of them - vying with one another to see how many famous women they would get into the hay.": "Bette",
  "I think it's real easy to be famous these days it's not real easy to sustain success. ": "Jerry",
  "Before I was famous, when I was just working in Gilbert's Lodge, everything was moving in slow motion.": "Eminem",
  "Among famous traitors of history one might mention the weather.": "Ilka",
  "A lot of stand-up comedy guys, when they get a little famous, just give up their stand-up career, and it cancels out the thing that set them apart.": "Johnny",
  "I wanted to go hide. I wasn't looking to be more famous, I'm famous enough.": "Howard",
  "Fame is something I think happens as a result of trying to do good work. If you're trying to be famous, your work usually suffers.": "Justin",
  "Pulp existed for 12 years before we got famous. Now, you could say that was just lack of imagination, but it's some kind of quality isn't it? Tenacity. You could also say it was sloth.": "Jarvis",
  "Having bodyguards is just part of being famous, I think.": "Dolph",
  "I'm not as famous as Stephen Hawking, but certainly in the U.S., I have a very high profile for a scientist. It is an awesome responsibility, one that I don't shoulder lightly.": "Neil",
  "I wanted to be famous for my music and my talent, and I always wished I could cut it out when I left the stage.": "Beyonce",
  "The most famous Obama precept is, 'No drama.'": "Dan",
  "The obviously inexperienced pilot is the game the scientific air-fighter goes after, and the majority of victories are won that way. But, on the other hand, it is the novice usually who gets the famous ace by doing at some moment the unexpected thing.": "Eddie",
  "Sometimes I wonder if I'm as famous for my wheelchair and disabilities as I am for my discoveries.": "Stephen",
  "If you're famous, you suck, just for being famous. People in England totally get that; Americans don't.": "Trey",
  "I never thought being famous would be wonderful, but my limited exposure to celebrity has shown me the dark side big-time.": "Marianne",
  "My mother always, always, always thought that I was going to be famous. Thought that I was going to win Oscars. In fact, I believe I accepted the Oscar as a ketchup bottle many a time in front of my mother in the kitchen. 'I'd like to thank the Academy,' I said with a ketchup bottle.": "Kevin",
  "I was a little boy singing sad songs, about 9 or 10 years old in the woods. I listened to my voice coming back to me. It was as high as you could go. I dreamed of being famous as a singer when I was on those cotton fields. I wanted to see the world and meet people.": "Percy",
  "I was in a number of school plays, one in particular, when I was 13 or 14, entitled 'Illusions.' It was put together by one of the teachers, and was about famous historical figures. I had to do the Martin Luther King 'I have a dream' speech, and some black women in the audience were clapping and crying and whooping.": "David",
  "Who you are as a person will only be amplified once you are 'famous,' so if you had a good heart, then I would imagine you'll have the same good heart but the means to do even more with it.": "Meghan",
  "It doesn't matter if you're famous or infamous. All that matters is you're a celebrity.": "Willie",
  "To seduce a woman famous for strict morals, religious fervor and the happiness of her marriage: what could possibly be more prestigious?": "Christopher",
  "I fear that, in the end, the famous debate among materialists, idealists, and dualists amounts to a merely verbal dispute that is more a matter for the linguist than for the speculative philosopher.": "Moses",
  "It was never about winning medals or being famous.": "Nancy",
  "When I was growing up, I thought I'd be a lot happier if I was famous and successful and if I had money.": "Russell",
  "I get very nervous around famous people and I get nervous around beautiful women.": "Liev",
  "I just cannot imagine why anyone would want to be really famous. You go to a restaurant and people are pointing at you and they talk about you and they whisper and it is very disconcerting it is a very odd feeling. ": "Jack",
  "Liverpool people are famous for liking clothes and fashion; they are very social and lively people, and we know that they like clothes.": "Vivienne",
  "I have an innate fear of fame. I've never thought being famous looked like such a good place to be. I love being incognito.": "Phoebe",
  "Like many children of the rich and famous, Paris Hilton didn't always get to spend quality time with her parents, especially her mother. A socially ambitious young woman, Kathleen Elizabeth Avanzino Richards Hilton, who had married into the celebrated Hilton Hotel family, was often out and about.": "Jerry",
  "I don't think I could think of a single thing that's more isolating than being famous.": "Lady",
  "It's nice to have famous people love you.": "Millie",
  "People just assume that if you're famous, you're in Hollywood.": "Megan",
  "I got a little bit famous. I didn't like it.": "Sia",
  "Famous for his 'Maverick' Western series in the 1950s and 'The Rockford Files' in the '70s, and in movies like 'The Great Escape' and 'Grand Prix' in between, James Garner played amiable, independent characters for more than a half-century and never lost his comforting, enduring appeal.": "Richard",
  "Nobody wants to end up super rich and famous - but divorced. I'm always clear on that and try to stay on the right side of the line.": "Bear",
  "My father's very public life as Famous Amos was the opposite of that of his ex-wife, my mother Shirley, who was fighting a very private, solitary battle with mental illness.": "Shawn",
  "Quite frankly, I didn't become an actor to become a movie star. I have never dreamed about being the most famous person on the planet. I just want to do really good work.": "Anne",
  "I'm a believer in the ordinary person, that the ordinary person is just as important and has an equally unique perspective on the world as someone who is famous or perhaps more privileged.": "Brandon",
  "For me, getting comfortable with being famous was hard - that whole side of it, the loss of anonymity, the loss of privacy. Giving up that part of your life and not having control of it.": "Michelle",
  "The records of adopted children are sealed in California. That seal is considered inviolable... The judge ruled that, because I was famous, he didn't have the same rights as other kids.": "Danielle",
  "First of all, plain and simple, you have no real idea of what it means to be famous until you become famous. It's a double-edged sword. Obviously there are a lot of amazing things about fame, but there are also a lot of challenging things about it.": "Michelle",
  "I don't like being recognised, I have no interest in being famous at all, I just do what I do. If I could be like Captain Kirk and beam myself up and then beam myself down, I would!": "Bruce",
  "There's some downsides to being famous, which are not even worth mentioning. But to combat the bad sides of being famous, you really should take advantage of the good sides. The good sides are, you can use that fame to get projects you might not normally get.": "Chris",
  "I've gotten books published. I've met famous people that are very nice. I look back and I say, 'Wow. Thank you, God, for giving me this gift. And thank you for helping me to keep going.'": "Mattie",
  "It's hard for me to just say, 'Wow, this is amazing - I'm famous. I'm living the dream.' I sit there and think, 'I'm scared - this can go away tomorrow.' My dad always says that I'm a tortured soul because I'm never pleased; I never feel like I deserve what I've achieved.": "Shawn",
  "What is it we want out of travel? Is it to take snapshots of ourselves in front of famous monuments, surrounded by other tourists? To eat unfamiliar food chosen from unintelligible menus? To earn frequent-flier miles? No. It's to glimpse what life is like somewhere else.": "Chris",
  "Fame is really strange. One day you're not famous, and then the next day you are, and the odd thing is that you know intellectually that nothing in the world is different. What mattered to you yesterday are the same things that matter today, and the rules all still apply - yet everyone looks at you differently.": "Matt",
  "I don't like a girl on social media, when you have an open inbox, answering questions from dudes left and right every day. What's the point? It's like having your number all out. Everybody think they're famous when they get 100,000 followers on Instagram and 5,000 on Twitter.": "Meek",
  "You get to be famous or have some notoriety and there are so many people who want a piece of you.": "Oscar",
  "People get a little sidelined thinking that fame and fortune is going to bring them happiness, peace and contentment in their lives. Everyone thinks they want to be famous until the paparazzi are in their face, and then they're asking, 'Just give me some privacy.'": "Linda",
  "My dear Mama, you are definitely the hen who hatched a famous duck.": "Henri",
  "There are high spots in all of our lives and most of them have come about through encouragement from someone else. I don't care how great, how famous or successful a man or woman may be, each hungers for applause.": "George",
  "If you want to be popular and famous, you can do it; it's dead easy if you have that ego desire. But most of my ego desires as far as being famous and successful were fulfilled a long time ago.": "George",
  "Becoming famous was never what I wanted to do. There's a lot of things that come with fame - it's what people in the limelight have to do.": "Bruno",
  "If you wanna be famous, then it's okay if the music is fake, because fame isn't real.": "Josh",
  "I think Princess Diana probably had the most famous haircut, or Farrah Fawcett or Jennifer Aniston.": "Dorothy",
  "Lance Armstrong, the famous cyclist and more importantly, cancer survivor, has said 'if you ever get a second chance for something, you've got to go all the way.'": "Michael",
  "You can become famous but you can't become unfamous. You can become infamous but not unfamous.": "Dave",
  "I wanted to be successful, not famous.": "George",
  "Save your rejections so that later when you are famous you can show them to people and laugh.": "Meg",
  "If you're lucky enough to be famous, then it's great if you can use your fame and the power your fame gives you to draw attention to things that really matter.": "Michael",
  "A chair is a very difficult object. A skyscraper is almost easier. That is why Chippendale is famous.": "Ludwig",
  "Thank God I arrived the day before yesterday, the first of the month, at this port of San Diego, truly a fine one, and not without reason called famous.": "Junipero",
  "It sounds really cheesy, but I've just really been so focused on making sure that I am nice to everyone that I work with and making the effort to get to know the people on set, whether it's the catering crew or the famous photographer.": "Gigi",
  "Being famous is wicked. But it's better to be normal.": "Rupert",
  "I'm famous for splurging at fast-food places. I'm currently obsessed with Taco Bell's bean and cheese burritos with extra green sauce and extra cheese. Gluttony!": "Fergie",
  "When you reach a certain status in Hollywood, you have to play a lot of games to stay in the limelight. It becomes more about being famous than being an actor.": "Jason",
  "I don't have the life of a famous person. But I do feel like I've been able to connect with a lot of people.": "Ann",
  "I have had the opportunity to become acquainted with many wonderful people from many walks of life. I have known rich and poor, famous and modest, wise and otherwise.": "Joseph",
  "Martyrdom: The only way a man can become famous without ability.": "George",
  "People are famous for being famous and for nothing else. And good luck to them, because it lasts about a year and then they're nothing again.": "Brian",
  "Dr. King's famous 'I Have a Dream' speech was delivered at 'The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom,' a call to justice beyond the traditional civil rights movement's focus.": "Charles",
  "One thing about being famous is the people around you, you pay all their bills so they very rarely disagree with you because they want you to pick up the check.": "Charles",
  "A sign of celebrity is that his name is often worth more than his services.": "Daniel",
  "Just because you're not famous, doesn't mean you're not good.": "Laura",
  "It's too late for me to get married before I'm famous. You never know people's intentions.": "Carmelo",
  "I'm a regular person. I know a lot of people love being famous. I don't like it. I'm just chillin'. YouknowwhatI'msayin'?": "Wale",
  "Other famous men, those of much talk and few deeds, soon evaporate. Action is the dignity of greatness.": "Jose",
  "Dates with actors, finally, just seemed to me evenings of shop talk. I got sick of it after a hile. So the more famous I became, the more I narrowed down my choices.": "Hedy",
  "When famous people come up to you it's a bit weird, but it's an honour, really, when they recognise you and want to chat to you for a bit.": "Wayne",
  "I kept saying that I'd never live in L.A., and I didn't think I would. But that's where the work is, and I ended up making a lot of friends there, and my old friends moved out to Los Angeles too. And also, I think when you're famous, its hard to live in a small town.": "John",
  "My family was musical on both sides. My father's family had a famous flautist and a classical pianist. My mother won a contest to be Shirley Temple's double - she was the diva of the family. At 8, I learned how to play guitar. I used to play songs from the '20s, '30s and '40s in the kitchen for my grandmother.": "Gloria",
  "I was never interested in being powerful or famous. But once I got to film school and learned about movies, I just fell in love with it. I didn't care what kind of movies I made.": "George",
  "Jack Palance was my distant uncle - that's the family gossip. Growing up, my family knew everything about his face getting burned and scarred in the military and how that mutilation led him to become such a famous 'heavy' in films. I prayed for good scars of my own. Not just acne scars.": "Chuck",
  "I've never worried about being rich or famous - for me, it's all about the dancing.": "Anton",
  "I learned to ride a ten-speed when I was 4 or 5. My uncle gave me the bike, hand-me-down, and everyone used to stare at me riding up and down this block. I was too short to reach the pedals, so I put my legs through the V of the frame. I was famous. The little kid who could ride the ten-speed.": "Jay-Z",
  "I made the Yankee hat more famous than a Yankee can.": "Jay-Z",
  "Some people are so famous that the legends about them and the cultural aftermath of their life altogether obscure the real human being.": "Michael",
  "I appreciate my music is famous, but I'd rather my face wasn't so that I can just live a normal life.": "Sia",
  "If anyone besides famous people knew what it was like to be a famous person, they would never want to be famous.": "Sia",
  "In the sixties, everyone you knew became famous. My flatmate was Terence Stamp. My barber was Vidal Sassoon. David Hockney did the menu in a restaurant I went to. I didn't know anyone unknown who didn't become famous.": "Michael",
  "It's sour grapes, I admit, I want to be more famous so people are examining my work couplet by couplet, you know what I mean? That's the level where I want to go.": "Frank",
  "There is a famous saying: 'It's hard to be a Jew.' It's also hard to be a Palestinian. I know that.": "Ariel",
  "Super-envious of the fact that Daft Punk can wear robot helmets and be one of the most famous bands in the world, while also understanding that will never be my situation.": "Frank",
  "I just like the company of beautiful women. I have a weakness in that department. And I suppose because I am fairly well off and a famous musician, I'm up for grabs. And that makes me an eligible bachelor in the press.": "Eric",
  "I'm learning as I go. I don't know everything. I never had anybody to look at, nobody ever taught me, and where I'm from I didn't have any famous role models.": "Wale",
  "I want to thank all the women who have worn my clothes, the famous and the unknown, who have been so faithful to me and given me so much joy.": "Yves",
  "Fate is being kind to me. Fate doesn't want me to be too famous too young.": "Duke",

  "I am beautiful, famous and gorgeous.": "Anna",
  "I want to be famous everywhere.": "Luciano",
  "There are people who appear in the magazines and I don't know who they are. I've never seen anything they've done and their careers are over already. They're famous for maybe 10 minutes. Real careers, I think, take a long time to unfold.": "Matt",
  "My favorite thing about being famous... it's not really as big of a deal as everybody says it is. Being on the road is tough, doing interviews, and all the stuff. It's still pretty tough.": "Aaron",
  "It's funny, when bands or younger musicians ask me: 'So, what does it take to make it?' Well, first explain to me what you mean by 'making it': Do you want to be a rock star or do you want music to be your livelihood?": "Eddie",
  "When you become a celebrity, the world owns you and your image.": "Megan",
  "I was brought up with psychics and tarot cards. My mum was always told I was going to be in a boy band and be famous as a singer.": "Lee",
  "One of the pleasant duties of America's most famous announcers during the relatively short swing era of the big bands was to host late-night remotes from some of the most famous ballrooms throughout the country.": "Nick",
  "He makes me laugh, Mick! He tended to turn up when we were having lunch and entertain us all. He bought an Enigma machine! I've never worked with a producer who was more famous than everyone put together.": "Saffron",
  "As a famous person you think how you're gonna end it, get away and have a normal life.": "Gwen",
  "I was obsessed with being rich and famous.": "Paul",
  "We are not interested in cloning the Michael Jordans and the Michael Jacksons of this world. The rich and the famous don't participate in this.": "Panayiotis",
  "Face it, I didn't become famous until I took my clothes off.": "Jude",
  "What I've learned is that you really don't need to be a celebrity or have money or have the paparazzi following you around to be famous.": "Lady",
  "There's more pressure to be famous for being yourself than if you're being a character.": "Kim",
  "The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality.": "Tom",
  "I'm hardly famous. I wouldn't want to trade places with anyone else.": "Nikki",
  "I know I'm not a self-indulgent idiot; I also know I'm not the second coming of Deepak Chopra. If I had believed either of those, or both, as some people do when they get famous, that's when the mental illness arrives.": "Elizabeth",
  "Decide very early on: do you want to be an actor or do you want to be famous? Because they're very different routes.": "James",
  "I'm not one of those famous people flying round the world emoting over every catastrophe. I'm too feeble.": "Kristin",
  "Well, I knew I wanted to be an actor, and I didn't necessarily need or want to be famous or a celebrity actor.": "Jenna",
  "I grew up being the girl who would always tune in to watch famous people talk about their careers, how they handled scandals and mega fame. I'm trying to pick up tips.": "Rebecca",
  "My buildings are more famous than me.": "Jean",
  "You don't become a chef to become famous.": "Eric",
  "And I don't want to live anywhere where I am famous. It makes me very, very uncomfortable, because it conveys an advantage over people, and I don't like that.": "Donna",
  "The caricature of science is that we hold tight to the theories we have, and shun challenges to them. That's just not true. In fact, we hold our highest rewards for those scientists who can prove others wrong. And by the way, they are famous in their own lifetimes. We don't wait until they're dead.": "Neil",
  "A friend at school was always being laughed at because his father emptied dustbins for a living. But those who laughed worshipped famous footballers. This is an example of our topsy-turvy view of 'success.' Who would we miss most if they did not work for a month, the footballer or the garbage collector?": "David",
  "A country that cannot feed itself cannot have self-pride, and in the mid-'60s 20 percent of all the wheat produced in America came into India. We were agriculturally a basket case. And 15 years later, 20 years later, we have become an agricultural power. This is the famous Green Revolution.": "Jairam",
  "You cannot hear the name Martin Luther King, Jr., and not think of death. You might hear the words 'I have a dream,' but they will doubtlessly only serve to underscore an image of a simple motel balcony, a large man made small, a pool of blood. For as famous as he may have been in life, it is - and was - death that ultimately defined him.": "Michael",
  "That's the most terrible thing about being an author - standing there at your mother's funeral, but you don't switch the author off. So your own innermost thoughts are grist for the mill. Who was it said - one of the famous lady novelists - 'unhappy is the family that contains an author'?": "Terry",
  "What's awful about being famous and being an actress is when people come up to you and touch you. That's scary, and they just seem to think it's okay to do it, like you're public property.": "Winona",
  "What is so weird is that young people who want to be 'celebrities' do not want to put in the hard work. They don't want to do the training, go to drama school, read Shakespeare, try different accents and study technique. They just want to be famous. It is not just in England; it's the same in America and all over Europe.": "Joan",
  "All dictators, the rich and famous, to the lowest security guard who holds a gun, easily forget that power is transitory.": "F.",
  "My father was this famous heart surgeon, a wonderful man... but there was something about me that drove him crazy.": "Dominick",
  "It is amazing what people feel they have the right to tell you to your face when you're famous.": "Emily",
  "Public scandals are America's favorite parlor sport. Learning about the flaws and misdeeds of the rich and famous seems to satisfy our egalitarian yearnings.": "Robert",
  "The most common form of giantism is a condition called acromegaly, and acromegaly is caused by a benign tumor on your pituitary gland that causes an overproduction of human growth hormone. And throughout history, many of the most famous giants have all had acromegaly.": "Malcolm",
  "Is fame without purpose and is fame without talent really where we are now? People used to be famous for what they did. Now, they're just famous.": "John",
  "I liked comedy as a kid. When I was a kid, I'd go to sleep to, like, Bill Cosby albums every night. I'd listen to 'Bill Cosby Is A Very Funny Fellow... Right!' and 'Wonderfulness,' which are two of his most famous albums. Then the next night, I'd flip them over, 'cause it was the old stackable turntable.": "Stephen",
  "In the media age, everybody was famous for 15 minutes. In the Wikipedia age, everybody can be an expert in five minutes. Special bonus: You can edit your own entry to make yourself seem even smarter.": "Stephen",
  "There's this famous observation that I totally believe: Great startup ideas are the ones that lie in the intersection of the Venn diagram of 'is a good idea' and 'looks like a bad idea.' So you want most people to think it's a bad idea and thus not compete with you until you get giant. But for it to secretly be good.": "Sam",
  "I wanted to be famous. It's embarrassing to admit, but I came out to L.A. thinking it would happen in no time. I thought, 'Once they see me, they'll be so glad I came.' I always had a ridiculous amount of self-confidence about what was going to happen to me.": "Chelsea",
  "I am still moved by passages of Marx: the 'Critique of Hegel's Philosophy of Right,' for example, where, after the famous line about religion being 'the opium of the people,' he goes on to call it 'the heart of a heartless world.'": "Geoff",
  "When I look back, I am happy that my mum took me to the gymnastics club. I didn't join gymnastics to become a famous athlete or celebrity; it just happened - I did more than I expected, of course.": "Nadia",
  "I just love the weather. I live on Miami Beach, which is all boutique hotels and cocktails. I do sometimes go along to smart parties in my white suit, but I wouldn't really recognise any famous people if they were there because I'm not very good at star-spotting.": "Irvine",
  "If you chase fame, you make bad choices. Being famous isn't interesting.": "Justin",
  "The historical profession is nowhere famous for its tolerance, but there are not many countries where historians can expect to pay for their opinions with penal servitude or the firing squad.": "Norman",
  "The stalkers can get a little scary at times, but I guess all these things are a part of being famous.": "Armaan",
  "I've never changed the way I live. I still walk the streets I don't give a damn. And everyone's very nice to me. But this new idea of being famous for no reason at all? I can't actually get my head round it. ": "John",
  "I have a profound empathy for people who are in the public eye, whether they manifest it themselves or whether it happened by accident - it doesn't matter to me. I think there's a great misunderstanding of what it is to be famous.": "Alanis",
  "I'm not famous I am simply very well-known to certain people. Famous is something different. ": "Anton",
  "Warren Buffett is famous for talking about the 'intrinsic value' of stocks. But while many people parrot this phrase, few know what it really means.": "Robert",
  "Usually, TED only invites the most accomplished and famous people in the world to give talks.": "Cameron",
  "Wanting to be an actor and wanting to be famous are different.": "Blake",
  "The benefits from stardom as Klinger outweigh any setbacks. It's a double-edged sword. What makes you famous is what interferes with getting other roles.": "Jamie",
  "Sometimes I'm fascinated with how famous my work could be while I'm not so famous.": "Frank",
  "I never had a desire to be famous... I was fat. I didn't know any fat famous actresses... You know, once a fat kid, always a fat kid. Because you always think that you just look a little bit wrong or a little bit different from everyone else. And I still sort of have that.": "Kate",
  "Before 'Titanic,' yes, I had done some things and, yes, I had been nominated for an Academy Award, but I had never been sort of world-famous. And I suppose, yes, I am really famous now. But I feel embarrassed to say that because it's just a bit daft for me.": "Kate",
  "I'm so famous, people expect me to sell as many records as Celine Dion or Puff Daddy.": "Marilyn",
  "I think it's useful, as a famous person, to have as little separation between the perception of you and how you really are - because otherwise I'd be sitting here thinking I'm keeping secrets, and wondering when you're going to find out.": "Daniel",
  "By no means do I try to go out and hang out with famous people.": "Brad",
  "I think anyone who is famous is a moron if they're on Twitter. It's just stupid.": "George",
  "No matter how much money you make, no matter how famous you are, you're not above going outside and cutting trees. I do it all the time.": "Bill",
  "There are a lot of good things about being famous but there are a few not so good things too.": "Sharon",
  "Superhero movies are so famous because of the metaphor that they trigger in one's self about who you could be if things were different.": "Patty",
  "Whenever I'm in theatre situations I will go out of my way not to talk about my father, but in the film world I can be really proud of my family and say, 'You know what: my dad's a really, really famous theatre director,' because nobody has any idea.": "Rebecca",
  "The only way to be turned off to being famous is to be famous.": "Jesse",
  "I've watched a lot of people who became famous who completely change and I think it's because they tend to believe all the hype that's out there. I don't think there's that much hype about me.": "Jane",
  "Celebrities have more influence to be able to reach out to people, but people are becoming famous on Facebook and social media every day.": "Shemar",
  "I'm not interested in being famous. I'm interested in doing my job and doing it well, and that's wrestling, and that's what I love.": "AJ",
  "I certainly don't want a child of mine to be famous, or anyone I was very close to who isn't yet... It's the worst thing to be trapped in your house not be able to leave.": "Elizabeth",
  "A very quiet and tasteful way to be famous is to have a famous relative. Then you can not only be nothing, you can do nothing too.": "P.",
  "I think that when you are famous every weakness is exaggerated.": "Marilyn",
  "Of course, 'I Will Always Love You' is the biggest song so far in my career. I'm famous for several, but that one has been recorded by more people and made me more money, I think, than all of them. But that song did come from a true and deep place in my heart.": "Dolly",
  "Sometimes I think that when people become famous, there's a public perception that they are not human beings any more. They don't have feelings; they don't get hurt; you can act and say as you like about them.": "Salman",
  "Forget about being world famous, it's hard enough just getting the automatic doors at the supermarket to acknowledge our existence.": "Douglas",
  "I once did a radio program with a famous materialist, that is to say a scientist who believed that absolutely everything was physical and that all emotions were reductive to little electrical impulses in your neurons. And I found that I didn't believe that. But what the emotions really are, I don't have an alternative theory.": "Tom",
  "I don't like Los Angeles. The people are awful and terribly shallow, and everybody wants to be famous but nobody wants to play the game. I'm from New York. I will kill to get what I need.": "Lady",
  "Joanne' is a progression for me. It was about going into the studio and forgetting that I was famous.": "Lady",
  "For me, growing up, the downside of it was that as a kid you don't want to stand out. You don't want to have a famous father let alone get a job because of your famous father, you know? But I'm a product of nepotism. That's how I got my foot in the door, through my dad.": "Jeff",
  "Whenever you're the child of a famous person, you get judged in odd ways because of that.": "Jeff",
  "I was suddenly really famous, and I didn't know how to cope. I didn't know myself well enough as a person, number one, and as an actor, number two. I wanted to escape.": "Kate",
  "I know the true meaning of getting by by the skin of my teeth; I do. It doesn't matter whether you've got money or you haven't, whether you're famous or not. This is the case for all women, actually; you have to carry on. You always have to carry on. And you can, because you have to.": "Kate",
  "Apart from its famous healing properties, manuka has a strong, woody flavour.": "Yotam",
  "It's famous that comedians have a very dark personal state of mind. I think, in my case, it's the same. The only way to get deep is to have a balance, or a counterbalance.": "Alejandro",
  "Many incredible artists die before they were famous.": "Yoko",
  "I made my living being 20 or 30 pounds heavier than the average model. And that's where I got famous.": "Tyra",
  "A while ago I said that, 'You know, I like a guy - he doesn't have to be all rich and famous - he can be normal.' And I remember I was walking in the mall, and this guy was like, 'Tyra, I'm normal. I live with my mama. I ain't got a car and I ain't got a job! I'm real normal.' And I'm like, 'That's not normal - that's a loser!'": "Tyra",
  "I was the most famous kid in the United States. That was 1936.": "Gore",
  "Whereas you have someone like Houdini, who works really, really hard to get really, really famous, and then has actual intellectual ideas that he puts into the culture that stay there.": "Penn",
  "For me a Writing Day was an occasion for self-reproach and panic, a time to lament the passing of the years, stare out of windows and remember that even those famous late starters Joseph Conrad and George Eliot had started by the age I was now.": "Howard",
  "The world is a bell curve. Classroom test scores, employee performance in a company or how many people really, really like you. No matter the population you're studying, they always fit neatly across the standard deviations of the famous bell curve.": "Simon",
  "Whenever someone says to my mum: 'How's your son doing?' she says: 'Which one?' If you're a parent, you're not going to go: 'Oh I'll concentrate on the famous one.'": "Martin",
  "I'm fortunate to be famous for two rather imposing characters like Magneto and Gandalf.": "Ian",
  "The strength of British theatre should be that these actors in their middle years know what they're doing and are good at it. Not rich, not famous, but making a living.": "Ian",
  "I'd never read 'Lord of the Rings' until I was asked to play Gandalf, so I didn't really know it was a frightfully famous book.": "Ian",
  "The fame thing is interesting because I never wanted to be famous, and I never dreamt I would be famous.": "J.",
  "You can't date if you're famous. That's how it seems to me.": "Orlando",
  "There were a few years there when I was just so enamored with the idea of living some sort of famous person's lifestyle that really isn't suited to me.": "Daniel",
  "It's interesting because people assume that because I'm famous I know all famous people.": "Daniel",
  "Part of being famous is offering up this blank screen upon which people can project everything, and it's a sacred act, putting yourself out there, in a way that lots of celebrities aren't steeled for; they're not prepared for the degree to which people define them.": "Alanis",
  "I thought the more famous I became, the more friendships I would have, but the opposite was true.": "Alanis",
  "Only traumatised people want to be famous.": "Alanis",
  "One thing lots of Christians do have in common is that they can't help coming across as smug. This winds lots of people up, particularly because famous Christians pronounce on the life of the poor from their very lovely affluent homes filled with their very lovely families and attractive pets.": "Jo",
  "I'll never forget one of those things that my father said to me. My father said: 'You know what? We have had so many amazingly positive experiences that we would have never had because you're famous. We can stand to have a couple negatives ones, too.'": "Rob",
  "One of the interesting things about Twitter is looking how famous people choose to use it. Take someone like Steve Martin, who I follow: it's all sorts of comic gems, nothing private, nothing personal - all jokes. Other celebrities are overtly personal - like Charlie Sheen. I do a mix of observations and updates.": "Rob",
  "There are loads of actresses that modelled. They just weren't famous. There weren't a lot that were really known as models that became actresses, but there are hordes of them that did modelling before such as Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Sharon Stone, Demi Moore and Geena Davis. There are loads of 'em.": "Andie",
  "Famous, adj.: Conspicuously miserable.": "Ambrose",
  "If people just want to be famous, that's just not enough to get you up at 4 in the morning to go to work. You have to love what you're doing.": "Zooey",
  "I want people to know me through the movies I do. I want to be judged on that. If you start becoming famous for your personal life, that's when your career goes away.": "Megan",
  "I know what it's like to be famous. It's good money and it's great fun. A real kick in the pants. People wave at you and smile at you. You get great tables in restaurants. They send you gifts - beautiful clothes and cars.": "Pierce",
  "I have a very down-to-earth father. My wife is an actress and famous herself is more down-to-earth than anyone I know.": "Brad",
  "I'm somebody who likes to gravitate toward people who aren't necessarily famous.": "Brad",
  "Evictions used to be rare in this country. They used to draw crowds. There are scenes in literature where you can come upon an eviction - like, in 'Invisible Man' there's the famous eviction scene in Harlem, and people are gathered around, and they move the family back in.": "Matthew",
  "I've never sat there and plotted out how I was going to become successful or famous.": "Jennifer",
  "When I first became famous, I didn't know if I could go where I wanted to because I didn't know how people were going to act. Some folks would scream and holler, and I didn't know what to do with that.": "Jill",
  "Temptation's something you have to deal with even if you're not famous. It's harder when you're famous because it's a lot more in your face, and that makes it a little more difficult to walk away from sometimes.": "Denis",
  "I learned a long time ago, if you want to keep your friends in show business, don't get famous. Because as soon as you get famous, a lot of the people you used to know, who didn't, become incredibly bitter and jealous. It's part of the territory.": "Denis",
  "The sound of my voice is more famous than me.": "Jimmy",
  "A few of the world's most famous non-American novelists have large followings in the United States, among them Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Guenter Grass, who were both popular even before winning the Nobel.": "Stephen",
  "I don't think it's anything you ever get used to... for many years, I could never sort of put my name in the same sort of category as the word 'famous' or anything like that. And I just found it very uncomfortable... if you get used to it, then something must be wrong.": "Johnny",
  "I liked myself much more before I got famous. I was much friendlier and had more energy.": "Sia",
  "I'll be the songwriter for pop stars and then they can be the front person and I don't have to be famous.": "Sia",
  "When I was 10, my parents really valued success in the arts, and I thought if I was a famous 'something artistic,' that they would love me more.": "Sia",
  "I don't want to be famous or recognizable. I don't want to be critiqued about the way that I look on the Internet... I've been writing pop songs for pop stars for a couple years and see what their lives are like, and that's just not something I want.": "Sia",
  "I don't really even go out that much now, except to walk my dogs, because I don't want to be recognised. I used to be a really friendly person, and now I just want to be invisible. I liked myself much more before I got famous. I was much friendlier and had more energy.": "Sia",
  "Most famous stage actors tactfully fade away.": "Robert",
  "Despite the rigid classicism of the famous Paris Opera school and company, the French have done more than their share to unmoor la Danse from its traditions and standards.": "Robert",
  "I used to send away for eight-minute Super 8 movies of various Ray Harryhausen scenes advertised on the back of 'Famous Monsters of Filmland' magazine.": "Peter",
  "'Heavenly Creatures' was really the idea of Fran Walsh. It was a very famous New Zealand murder case, but not one that people knew much about.": "Peter",
  "Celebrities and 'famous' people are just regular folks. I know, it's a shocking and potentially dangerous statement.": "Adam",
  "Ultimately, the only people who are in any way edified by hanging with famous people are you at the age of 11 and your mom.": "Adam",
  "When I was starting out, I thought I would go into comedy and there would be a mentor, like the Philip Seymour Hoffman character in 'Almost Famous,' in my life, and there just wasn't. It was really frustrating for me because I desired that so much.": "Mike",
  "Vegas is famous for a lot of things, and bad marriages are one of them. Margo and I are proof that you can make this work. It just takes a little effort.": "Ron",
  "If you become famous and don't have a live show to back it up, they're not going to pay you any money.": "Ron",
  "I begged the universe to make me a famous comedian, and it did. So I tend not to ask for any more.": "Ron",
  "I don't like to do material people have heard. Now, they like to hear material that they know, because that's the stuff that made me famous, and, unfortunately, I don't do a ton of it.": "Ron",
  "When we made 'Night of the Living Dead,' we got riddled. There was this famous article Roger Ebert wrote just blasting the film because he had gone to see it at some screening where there were all these kids in the audience. I don't know why that happened. We didn't make the movie for kids.": "George",
  "You don't knock television, even if you don't always like what they make of your work. It makes all the difference between being an also-ran writer and very famous.": "Ruth",
  "'Ali' offers stunning re-creations of bouts Ali fought. In the second Liston fight, the auditorium is underlighted and clouded with fetid cigar smoke, which was why the famous picture of a snarling Ali standing over Liston was so dramatic; indoor arenas are now bright enough to be spotted from Alpha Centauri.": "Elvis",
  "Passion for fame: A passion which is the instinct of all great souls.": "Edmund",
  "I've walked with very famous people down red carpets over to the crowd of thousands of people, and you'll reach out to shake their hand and they've got a camera in their hand. And they don't even get their hand out, because they're recording the whole time.": "George",
  "I had my Aunt Rosie, who was famous and then not, so I got a lesson in fame early on. And I understood how little it has to do with you. And also how you could use it.": "George",
  "If you're famous, I don't - for the life of me - I don't understand why any famous person would ever be on Twitter.": "George",
  "I do know something about the news world. I was sitting on the floors of newsrooms since I was seven years old, and I've been around them my whole life. I understand that someone looks at a story with famous people in it, and you want to put it out.": "George",
  "To put it simply - you know, a lot of people believe that the benefit of this job is fame and fortune. I believe that you pay for the fortune through the fame. I don't buy into the notion that being famous is somehow a good thing, or an exciting thing, or a wonderful thing.": "Evangeline",
  "I went from being totally unknown and never acting professionally to being in a major movie and being very famous. It all happened so quickly, I didn't have any time to work things out. It's been pretty scary at times.": "Emma",
  "I was famous in our college for calm and impassionate discussion; for one whole summer, I rose at five and went to bed at midnight, that I might have sufficient time for theology and metaphysics.": "William",
  "A voice is very intimate. It's something of your own. So there's always this fear, because you feel naked. There's a fear of not reaching up to expectations. As you become more famous, people come and expect to hear something extraordinary, so you don't want to disappoint them. I feel this sense of responsibility.": "Andrea",
  "Whether we are famous or not, we all need God. We also need other people.": "Chuck",
  "When we were growing up our parents somehow made it clear that being famous was good. And I mistakenly thought that if I was famous then everyone would love me.": "Ellen",
  "I wanted to have money I wanted to be special I wanted people to like me I wanted to be famous. ": "Ellen",
  "Just to go into a shop without getting stared at would be nice. I mean, I don't walk around like, 'Oh, I'm trying to be famous' - I try to lead as normal a life as possible - but sometimes it's annoying. It's fine; it's not a massive problem, but sometimes it's just a bit uncomfortable.": "Kate",
  "The first time I went to Johnny Depp's house in LA is when I realized what I was getting myself into. I knew he was famous, but I didn't really know what that entailed.": "Kate",
  "You just feel like you're doing a job that you want to be doing, and then one day, somebody asks you a question like that: 'What's it like to be famous?' It doesn't really mean anything. The only difference is some people stop you and ask you for photographs.": "Hozier",
  "I was born on October 21, 1956 in Burbank, California. My father, Eddie Fisher, was a famous singer. My mother, Debbie Reynolds, was a movie star. Her best-known role was in 'Singin' In The Rain.'": "Carrie",
  "You knew how humiliating that is as an experience for celebrities to be less of a celebrity. There's no class to adjust to being less famous, and you don't think you have to worry about it. But you do.": "Carrie",
  "I partied in every capital in Europe, basked on all the famous beaches, and good-timed it in South America, the South Seas, the Orient, and the more palatable portions of Africa.": "Frank",
  "Have I ever been to a party with a ton of famous people in it? Yes, several times, so I guess that's a Hollywood lifestyle.": "Michael",
  "It's great to make your own choices, but there's a price to pay. I could've made more money or been more famous. I could be the current groovy guy.": "Michael",
  "It's part of the celebrity process but my life has never been as interesting or as wild as what's been printed about me.": "Winona",
  "I'm an active participation guy. No matter how much money you make, no matter how famous you are, you're not above going outside and cutting trees. I do it all the time.": "Bill",
  "I have been very happy, very rich, very beautiful, much adulated, very famous and very unhappy.": "Brigitte",
  "Famous is celebrityism, and I don't want that... I know that I'm not that. Everybody knows who you are. I can't imagine living that life, but I don't think I consider myself famous.": "Robin",
  "Because you know when you first become famous, you start walking a little different because people are staring at you.": "Bono",
  "I admire sensible, kind people. They're not often famous.": "John",
  "It isn't necessary to be rich and famous to be happy. It's only necessary to be rich.": "Alan",
  "What I can't completely understand is most other people's fascination with what the famous among us do with their lips and the rest of their bodies. Why do ordinary people become the target of this curiosity simply by virtue of the fact that other people recognise their names and faces but know almost nothing else about them?": "Alan",
  "I had never really wanted to be famous. Everyone is supposed to want to be rich and famous, but as a boy I never knew what rich was, and the first view I had of famous made me leery.": "Alan",
  "I can't relate to people who treat me as a 'famous person.' I only like to hang around with people who treat me as a regular person because that's what I am. All people are really just regular.": "Judy",
  "My hair was famous before I was.": "Christopher",
  "Celebrity was a long time in coming it will go away. Everything goes away. ": "Carol",
  "But I didn't ask to have somebody nose around in my private life. I didn't even ask to be famous. All I asked was to be able to earn a living making people laugh.": "Carol",
  "You can get rich or famous by doing the same thing.": "Ang",
  "I'm doing a new musical on Broadway, which opens in October called 'The Boy from Oz,' where I play Peter Allen. For those of you who don't know, he became first famous in America for marrying Liza Minelli.": "Hugh",
  "The problem is, the more famous you get, the more people see you who didn't choose to.": "Louis",
  "Show me an actor who doesn't want to be famous, and I'll show you a liar. Later, you realise that there's more to it than just the acquisition of fame, and money and girls. But that is what drives them and was what drove me, initially.": "Kevin",
  "Any idiot can get laid when they're famous. That's easy. It's getting laid when you're not famous that takes some talent.": "Kevin",
  "My dad was an architect, and he wasn't a rich guy, but in our little world in Philadelphia, he was famous. He loved to see his picture in the paper. I wanted to be more famous than him.": "Kevin",
  "There are two types of actors: those who say they don't want to be famous, and those who are liars.": "Kevin",
  "One of the top comments I get from people is, 'Oh my God, you're like a regular person!' That's kind of a bizarre thing to live with. I know a lot of famous people, and their lives may not be regular, but they are regular people.": "Kevin",
  "I wasn't going off to New York to be more famous than my father, but in retrospect, that certainly was driving me. He was famous in Philadelphia, but it was also really important to him to be famous. And to a certain extent, I got some of that, even though there were parts of it that horrified me.": "Kevin",
  "I turned down many chances to be on TV before 'Pop Idol' because I really wasn't interested in being famous. I didn't need it and didn't want it.": "Simon",
  "I've interviewed presidents and royalty, rock stars and movie stars, famous generals and captains of industry; I've had front row seats at Super Bowls, World Series, and Olympic Games; my books have been on best-seller lists, and my marriage is a long-running success.": "Tom",
  "I'm always so amazed by which performances work really, really well and which ones don't. But I think it's just mostly, 'She's Out Of My League,' so many people saw that movie on DVD and on the plane. Just millions of people saw that movie. That's the reason I'm somewhat famous.": "T.",
  "Sometimes you forget you're famous. You wonder, 'Why is that person staring at me?'": "Bob",
  "Frost was no match for Nixon - far from being an intrepid and challenging interviewer, he was a pushover for the great and the famous, always deeply impressed with the fact that here he was, David Frost, putting questions to - Richard Nixon!": "Michael",
  "The rich and famous expect to get a lot for their story, whether they are writing it themselves or not. It's not that they need the money, of course; it's a question of ego, like catching the biggest fish.": "Michael",
  "Of course the rich and famous tend to have more going on in their lives than ordinary people, but they aren't always willing to tell the interesting bits.": "Michael",
  "Peter Fleming was a famous English traveler, explorer and adventurer, whose non-fiction books were hugely successful. My father owned signed copies of all of them - he and Peter Fleming had become acquainted over some detail of set design at the Korda film studio in Shepperton - and I had read each of them with breathless adolescent excitement.": "Michael",
  "See, 'A Time to Kill' was the one I got famous off of. Big ka-boom, over one weekend. After that, I did films that I really wanted to do.": "Matthew",
  "What I do is what I like; if I'm not as famous as I'd like to be, I've done it to myself.": "Blake",
  "The fire in the belly is essential, otherwise you become Michael Buble - famous and meaningless.": "Morrissey",
  "I became famous, I think, really because of the interpretation of other people's songs, way back when, and that's what I enjoy the most. And I'm a lazy bugger.": "Rod",
  "There is this power that comes with being famous.": "Rod",
  "I have some idea of the pressure of finding your own identity with a famous father.": "Michael",
  "I don't want to be famous as a movie star and have the whole world love me, I want to be a creative actress.": "Juliette",
  "When you become famous at 19, it does a number in your head, so you find romance in the mundane - isn't it so great that a guy would pick me up at my house and take me to a restaurant?": "Juliette",
  "I've never really cared if I was famous for my music. It was just something I had to do.": "Juliette",
  "I'd rather be the protector than the protected. I'm naturally the protector - being a mother and having a famous family. You have to navigate when it's right to protect.": "Solange",
  "In journalism, we recognize a kind of hierarchy of fame among the famous. We measure it in two ways: by the length of an obituary and by how far in advance it is prepared. Presidents, former presidents, and certain heads of state are at the top of the chain.": "Walter",
  "Sometimes a famous subject may even outlive his own obituary writer.": "Walter",
  "Being famous has changed a lot, because now there's so many outlets, between magazines, TV shows, and the Internet, for people to stalk and follow you. We created the monster.": "Madonna",
  "Did you ever stop to think why cops are always famous for being dumb? Simple. Because they don't have to be anything else.": "Orson",
  "I think people should be protected from being made to feel that they want to know what somebody famous had for breakfast.": "John",
  "Famous doesn't mean anything. Just because people know my face doesn't mean they know us or that it makes us any more interesting or better.": "Melissa",
  "I think that most people who are just artists, who are getting famous, would trade a lot of their fame back for some normalcy, pretty much immediately.": "Ansel",
  "You can't be a good actor if you get too affected by fame. Because then you're not real, and you're not really wanting more. You look at a lot of actors who, before they were famous, did a lot of amazing work, and once they got too big, it just got off.": "Ansel",
  "My name is not big enough for people to go, 'Let me throw money at you because you're so famous!'": "Nikki",
  "No one teaches you how to be a famous person no one teaches you how to be a role model. It's something you have to do on your own. ": "Maisie",
  "This whole segregation between famous people and other people is complete rubbish.": "Maisie",
  "You hear horror stories about scary mothers who just want their kids to be famous. I could be waitressing in a restaurant, and my mum would be happy as long as I was happy.": "Maisie",
  "I think there are a lot of people who really want to be famous, they really do. I don't. It sort of gets in the way of the everyday things that I do.": "Johnny",
  "I've been famous for a long, long time. So I don't think of it - I think of it very differently. It's the normal temperature of my room.": "Sharon",
  "This sounds crazy, but I know so many famous people, I'm just not intimidated by anyone. I feel really comfortable with it.": "Tom",
  "When I did 'Percy Jackson,' people told me, 'Oh, you're going to be so famous... you're not going to be able to walk down the street... it's going to be huge,' and it wasn't - although it was big for my career.": "Alexandra",
  "What I've said before, only half in joke, is that everybody in Ireland is famous. Or, maybe better, say everybody is familiar.": "Seamus",
  "I do probably come down a little hard on a group of people I call the 'blue chip gays.' I mean people who have managed to become very, very famous and are still very famous partly through staying in the closet, like Jasper Johns, Cy Twombly, Susan Sontag, Harold Brodkey and others.": "Edmund",
  "I love what I do for a living, but the other side, that aspect of being famous or a celebrity's got zero interest to me.": "Jeffrey",
  "The most famous and one of the most thoroughgoing opponents of bank credit was Thomas Jefferson. Jefferson reacted to the panic of 1819 as a confirmation of his pessimistic views on banks.": "Murray",
  "The day before I was famous in Denmark, nobody looked my way. The day after, everybody wanted to talk to me.": "Mads",
  "There's precedent for adjudicatory proceedings on technology issues to have massive consumer and business benefits. One of the most famous was the so-called Carterfone decision in 1968.": "Walt",
  "I think Chris Martin is younger than I am, but when I met him, I felt like I was talking to my father. It's so strange, that feeling when someone is that famous - you assume that they are either older or better.": "Jenny",
  "There's a definite responsibility that comes with being famous. You shouldn't be able to just dress up and look pretty.": "Rashida",
  "I have to say, you know, I've seen so many people go through the cycle and become famous and not famous anymore and, you know, want - have their priorities change and want different things.": "Rashida",
  "I want to eat, cook, meet famous people and make fun of them.": "Roseanne",
  "He caressed my backside. I had heard that he was famous for his 'admiration' of the ladies, but I didn't expect him to be handling my booty. As handsome as Prince Philip is, I wasn't sure if he was making a pass or just exercising some royal rights to squeeze the foreigners.": "Debbie",
  "I really don't know anything else because my brothers were famous when I was two years old. So I know nothing else, no other life.": "Janet",
  "I have no interest in Shakespeare and all that British nonsense... I just wanted to get famous and all the rest is hogwash.": "Anthony",
  "Some people are really nice about it. I get Saudi princes and famous people stopping me in L.A. and saying, 'You're Stifler's mom. Can I take a picture with you?' But then you get people like her putting their camera in your face without asking. They think they can do whatever they like.": "Jennifer",
  "The worst thing about being famous is the invasion of your privacy.": "Justin",
  "I have an ambition to write a great book, but that's really a competition with myself. I've noticed that a lot of young writers, people in all media, want to be famous but they don't really want to do anything. I can't think of anything less worth striving for than fame.": "Zadie",
  "There's inevitably something missing when you grow up in this kind of an environment when your parents travel a lot. When your father is famous, you are looked at and expected of. There are standards you need to meet.": "Natalie",
  "It's hard to make a living in this business. Unions aren't as strong as they used to be. For a journeyman actor - someone who doesn't have a famous name but has consistent work in theater or film or TV - it has become harder to get through, harder to raise a family.": "Annette",
  "I know I am in a band that is famous, and my private life is famous. I get it, and it's fine. Even when I grew up in a village, people wanted to know who was going to the dance with whom, and I understand, but I think if I engage with it too much, it won't be that healthy.": "Chris",
  "Our country was not built to support blood dynasties or to elevate the rich and famous to a higher ethical or constitutional plain.": "Andrew",
  "People enjoy making fun of people who are famous they love putting people down. ": "Lee",
  "If I got too famous, I'd just quit acting, but I think it's highly unlikely I'm going to get really famous.": "Rebecca",
  "I'm actually a very private person. Sometimes I'm in denial that I'm really famous.": "Britney",
  "Turing was a quite brilliant mathematician, most famous for his work on breaking the German Enigma codes. It is no exaggeration to say that, without his outstanding contribution, the history of the Second World War could have been very different.": "Gordon",
  "I bemoan the fact that all my famous friends have places in St. Bart's and I have to go to Montauk.": "Rufus",
  "You can talk to someone relatively famous, and they say, 'What do you do? What do you do for a job?' and I say, 'I make documentaries for the BBC,' and you see their eyes just glaze over.": "Louis",
  "I've always been quite famous for my nose.": "Darcey",
  "And to me, fame is not a positive thing. The idea of being famous is a lot better than the reality. It's fantastic when you go to premieres and people cheer you, but it's not real. And it's totally not my approach to get my name on a club door just because I can.": "Tom",
  "It is ridiculous - like a mad whirlwind... it's mad that I'm so famous.": "Amy",
  "The search for happiness has long been a dominant feature of American life. It's a byproduct of prosperity, not to mention the most famous line in the Declaration of Independence.": "Meghan",
  "Air travelers, of course, are famous for their hubris. They carry on too many bags and use the restroom when the seat-belt sign is on.": "Meghan",
  "To be a Southern Ground artist, you have to be a lifer. It's not about winning a karaoke contest or a television show to become famous. It's about really paying your dues. It's people I'm fans of and want to help in the business.": "Zac",
  "I was very dramatic - very, like, 'It's never going to happen. My life is over at 16 because I'm not already famous. I'm not going to get my record deal. I'm not going to be able to sing for a living.'": "Trisha",
  "Why am I so famous? What am I doing right? What are the others doing wrong?": "Barbra",
  "It was never in my mind to be famous.": "Francois",
  "Kids will ask us 'How do you become famous?' It's the wrong question. Focus on the craft, not on the fame.": "Isaac",
  "I'm hardly the most notable person in 'Zombieland.' The other actors in it are way more famous than I am.": "Jesse",
  "I meet people who are in movies, and the stuff that they write is terrible, but nobody tells them that because they're famous. So I worry that my stuff might be like that, too.": "Jesse",
  "I'm not a fan of the working class being mocked, including by some of our famous writers - even those who came from it.": "Melvyn",
  "When I was 20, I wanted to be famous and win a Grammy and have people respect and love me.": "Andra",
  "I guess some people want to be performers because they want to be famous.": "Jenny",
  "'The Admirable Crichton' is probably Barrie's most famous work after 'Peter Pan', nearly a pendant to that classic.": "Michael",
  "Hitler was so modern, in that he was obsessed with being famous. He was caught up with this rush to be have achieved greatness before turning 30.": "John",
  "No matter what you achieve, what you want to aspire to be, or how famous and powerful you become, the most important thing is whether you are excited about each and every moment of your life because of your work and people around you.": "Sushant",
  "Nikola Tesla, one of Colorado's famous residents, always believed that the gasoline engine made no sense.": "Kimbal",
  "Henry Miller is a famous writer whose work has fallen out of fashion, but I strongly recommend that readers who don't know his work pick up a book and experience this writer's zealous, crazy, inventive, funny, sexy, often delirious prose.": "Siri",
  "I would have been very happy just working from job to job, paying my rent one movie at a time. I never wanted to be this famous. I never imagined this life for myself.": "Kristen",
  "Fact is, famous people say fame stinks because they love it so - like a secret restaurant or holiday island they don't want the hoi polloi to get their grubby paws on.": "Julie",
  "It's not the job of the art to accommodate me and make me more money, make me more famous and get me more girls.": "Mike",
  "I remember I wanted to be an athlete. I wanted to be in the NFL or NBA or something, and I don't think I dreamed of being a benchwarmer. I'm sure I wanted to be the best. But I didn't really ever think I was going to be a famous musician.": "Mike",
  "I wanted to be the most famous. And it wasn't until I hung out with Justin Bieber that the whole thing got demystified. The mystique of it was gone.": "Mike",
  "You know, many people who become famous and enjoy great success when they're young disappear after that. Maybe I've lucked out because I came back and went to work.": "David",
  "What happened to me during the last couple of years of 'The Partridge Family' was I became so famous and so isolated and so unhappy that I had to do anything I could to end it.": "David",
  "Nobody prepares you for what happens when you get famous, and I didn't handle it well.": "Chevy",
  "I'm willing to make compromises based on someone I think is the one, but I think it's psychologically important to people when they're famous to be the only famous person they know.": "John",
  "I had no desire to be famous I just wanted to make the greatest music ever made. I didn't want anyone to know who I was. ": "Robert",
  "Don't call me famous, but it's hard to be out with my friends now.": "Katie",

  "I'd always need a creative outlet. But sometimes, I do fantasize what my life would be like if I weren't famous.": "Jodie",
  "It's key to become 'famous' for one thing first, and that will give you the credibility to go into other areas once your ready... which generally means a long time and a lot of perfecting!": "Kevin",
  "Marx and Engels are arguably history's most famous couple. Such was the closeness of their collaboration that it is not always easy to recall which works bore both names, which just that of Marx, and which just Engels.": "Martin",
  "In terms of being a famous person, it hasn't changed anything. It's not important for me.": "Lizzie",
  "It's easy to be famous today. People pay a million dollars to be recognized, but nobody cares about them. They cared about me because I did things other men were afraid to do. That's why my fans identified with me. They were mostly working-class.": "Evel",
  "You can be famous for a lot of things. You can be a Nobel-prize winner. You can be the fattest guy in the world.": "Evel",
  "I could have been a dental hygienist with nothing bad ever appearing in print about me, but that's not how I've chosen to lead my life. I knew that you put yourself under a microscope the more famous you become.": "Julia",
  "Do you remember the wrestler Andre the Giant? Famous. He had acromegaly.": "Malcolm",
  "I absolutely loved being famous. It was all great, up until the point when it wasn't.": "Noel",
  "Anything that's of any use, famous people get hold of it and take it for themselves and it gets a bad rap.": "Noel",
  "I was the big, bossy older sister, full of enthusiasms, mad fantasies, desperate urges to be famous, and anxious to be a saint - a settled sort of saint, not one who might have to suffer or die for her faith.": "Maeve",
  "The one thing I've always done as an author is talk to my publicists. Because they have all the best stories - and they have all the dirt on other, more famous and important writers. They're not supposed to talk about it, but sometimes you can get awesome little tidbits from them.": "Lynn",
  "You have to be realistic. I'd love to be more famous, have lots of people supporting me, people knowing my name, but I need a tennis racket or a golf club or to play football. Being a female, I don't stand a chance.": "Victoria",
  "I remember debating the finer points of flaky pastry with my chicken-pot-pie-obsessed American dad. I remember the divine mix of Thai food, TV dinners, and hearty, homemade goodness that have shaped this palate of mine to this day. I remember all this, but I still Google my husband's birthday. Thank God he's famous.": "Chrissy",
  "What's the name of that famous museum in Paris? The Louvre? I went through that place in 20 minutes.": "Peter",
  "My father always had people around the house who were famous psychics.": "Natalie",
  "I'm focused on the next generation, because I think it's very hard to break the habit of adults who've got salt and sugar addictions and just ways of being in this world. It's very hard even for the most enlightened people at famous universities that are very wealthy to spend the money that it takes to feed the students something delicious.": "Alice",
  "Everybody just wants to be famous first, and then maybe learn how to act.": "Dennis",
  "To enjoy being famous, you need to have a screw loose.": "Diablo",
  "You know, I did not like being famous. It was a stressful and ugly time, and I'm glad it's over.": "Diablo",
  "I don't think you can decide how famous or not you become.": "Rupert",
  "This whole celebrity racket, it's not really my bag. I don't really do that stuff, and I am not looking to get famous myself. I would love it if my characters get famous, my work was well known and appreciated. But I'm an actor, not a spokes model or a celebrity or whatever that is. I don't know how to be that.": "John",
  "I have smelled some very famous and undoubtedly sexy boys. And sometimes, as cute as they are, I'd rather have them as a friend - just because of the way they smell!": "Rachel",
  "It wasn't easy navigating publicity when I started, because I grew up with 'being famous,' and I'm just not into it, and I guess defensiveness gets read into that. And I didn't get an easy ride at the beginning.": "Stella",
  "My mum had a massive influence on me, not just in what she wore and how she looked, but in her spirit. She was married to one of the most famous men in the world, and she didn't wear any makeup, ever. I mean, have you ever seen the wife of a man like that rock up with no makeup on? Because I haven't since.": "Stella",
  "Everybody wanted me to be rich and famous on my art. And I said no to all the commercials and all the seedy offers.": "Philippe",
  "Fame was never something I was seeking in my artistic journey. It's to be used as a tool for an artist to break open doors and keep creating. That's how I enjoyed fame in '74 it was not just for the emptiness of being famous. ": "Philippe",
  "It's one of the central problems of American culture: telling you if you're younger, more beautiful, more famous, whatever, that then you'll be happy.": "Theresa",
  "I'm just a guy who happens to work in public from time to time. I've built a reputation as an established comic, not as a celebrity - a celebrity is someone who is famous but doesn't do anything.": "Dylan",
  "I don't know what 'famous' is, really.": "Karl",
  "I guess a show like 'Entourage' would be wish fulfillment, right? But 'Entourage' is wish fulfillment for men. It's that you can be kind of schlumpy-looking and have access to someone famous and find yourself at a pool party surrounded by girls in bikinis.": "Jill",
  "Everything I achieve affects my family as well, and suddenly, my kids' dad became the most famous man in the country for a couple of weeks.": "Bradley",
  "Sometimes people offer you plays, they offer you parts, but they only offer it because I'm famous.": "Chris",
  "I love being famous. It's almost like being white.": "Chris",
  "For now I'm just enjoying being a mom. I don't want to be more famous and more rich. I want to be a good mom.": "Jewel",
  "Some people want fame, popularity and huge sales. I've always hoped to have a really long career. So I've tried to make each of my creative decisions and business decisions to allow for longevity. As a side effect I got really famous and really big. I didn't realize the two could go together.": "Jewel",
  "I don't see anything wrong in someone wanting to be famous or having sky-high ambitions.": "Randeep",
  "Everyone wants to be famous so do I. But I cannot lose sleep over it. ": "Randeep",
  "Indian paper is famous, Egyptian papyrus, Chinese paper... every country has used this natural material. But the problem is it's going to run out because it's very difficult work.": "Issey",
  "Famous people come up to me, but I don't know who they are because my sight is so bad. It's always at the pool of the Four Seasons in Beverly Hills when I don't have my lenses in and my glasses are in my room.": "Helena",
  "As a writer, I tend to be drawn to marginal people - writers, poet-prophets, seers, eccentrics - who embody the deeper ambivalences of their societies and bear deeper witness to their world than the famous figures we are used to celebrating, or demonizing, in our histories.": "Pankaj",
  "To my surprise, the more I searched about Qi Xiangfu, the more I found of a life lived partly online. He once wrote a short memoir in which he described himself in the third person, with the formality usually reserved for China's most famous writers.": "Evan",
  "When you see a fantastic colour or cut in a magazine, perched up on some famous so-and-so's head, it's tempting to ask your stylist for the same, but do not be fooled. The hair in those fancy photos can be very high maintenance.": "Beth",
  "I don't feel famous and I didn't want my autobiography to be like a Paris Hilton story.": "Beth",
  "I don't really consider myself to be famous.": "Victoria",
  "I certainly don't think you need to be famous to want to leave a legacy, but when you are famous, it's even more likely that your child will get the wrong perspective on your life if you die prematurely.": "Shania",
  "I lost some of my friends because I got so famous, people who just assumed that I would be different now. I felt like everyone hated me. That is the most unhappy time of my life.": "Haruki",
  "I don't have many famous friends, really, except Simon Cowell.": "Leona",
  "Usually when I see someone famous, for some reason, I think I know them.": "Leona",
  "The famous pilot season literally sends shivers down my spine.": "Lily",
  "There's a tendency, when the offspring of a famous person does something notable, to define them by their more-famous parent.": "Rachel",
  "I have so much empathy for these young actors that are 19 and all of a sudden they're beautiful and famous and rich. I'm like, 'Oh my God, I'd be dead.'": "Philip",
  "I don't know the literary world; I was scared of being confronted with famous names, not knowing what they had written. It was occupied territory I was entering.": "John",
  "Know the names of past and current artists who are most famous for playing their instruments.": "Marilyn",
  "There has been a time on earth when poets had been young and dead and famous - and were men. But now the poet as the tragic child of grandeur and destiny had changed. The child of genius was a woman, now, and the man was gone.": "Tom",
  "The whole 'American Idol' way of looking at things is the antithesis of what I grew up with. There are a whole lot of kids wanting to be famous now, whereas if I'd even mentioned that word to one of my teachers, I would have got into a whole load of trouble.": "Harry",
  "Tom Cruise, he's a lot more famous than me.": "David",
  "I didn't get hugely famous really quick. It was a slow, gradual process, so I was able to sort of grow into myself and figure out who I was and what I wanted without the glaring spotlight on me telling me who I was.": "Sarah",
  "I'm English. Our dentistry is not world famous.": "Christian",
  "I never, ever see myself as a celebrity or famous, so I poke fun at that.": "Kendra",
  "I never, ever see myself as a celebrity or famous.": "Kendra",
  "The family is very important. They make me feel good always because if I won, when I started to be famous, the relationship never changed with my friends and family.": "Rafael",
  "We played at a festival in Mexico City, at the same time as another famous artist, and I reckon we had 55,000 people watching New Order; the other had 7,000. I think from that I've discovered the secret of success in the music industry: don't do any promotion.": "Bernard",
  "I just think Rosa Parks was overrated. Last time I checked, she got famous for breaking the law.": "Stephen",
  "Two famous happy warriors - Reagan and his political soulmate, British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher - knew they were fighting their own ideological and external wars. But they did so with the sunny dispositions and positive outlooks of those who knew they were on the right side of history.": "Monica",
  "Sometimes I get a little exhausted by shows or movies that are constantly throwing famous people on. And I find it so much more exciting to not have that when I'm watching something. I think it allows you to get more lost in something and also to bring more attention to more unknown or less recognizable people.": "Tig",
  "Luckily, I don't think that I'm too famous. I can still live my life pretty comfortably. Fame has never really ever appealed to me. I think it's easy to see that it's not a great thing to have.": "Tig",
  "I don't want to be movie-star famous. I want to move people with my writing.": "Ethan",
  "I never pursued being 'famous.'": "Francesca",
  "Exposure makes you famous, not just good work. Famous is being plastered everywhere.": "Francesca",
  "Jesus of Nazareth was the most famous human being who ever lived on this planet, and he had no infrastructure, and it's never been done. He had no government, no PR guy, no money, no structure. He had nothing, yet he became the most famous human being ever.": "Bill",
  "I had no preconceived idea what fame would be like, because I never thought I would be famous. I just wanted to do my work. Hell, I just wanted to pay my rent on time.": "Iyanla",
  "I don't go to premieres. I don't go to parties. I don't covet the Oscar. I don't want any of that. I don't go out. I just have dinner at home every night with my kids. Being famous, that's a whole other career. And I haven't got any energy for it.": "Gary",
  "The death of a famous person is different from the death of a loved one, whether it is Michael Jackson, Frank McCourt, or Walter Cronkite. We didn't know any of them personally, and yet, we experience a sense of loss.": "Madeleine",
  "My high-school coach Tony Reginelli was kind of famous for 'Reggie-isms,' kind of like 'Yogi-isms.' He always said if you want to be a good quarterback, when sprinting left you want to be amphibious and throw left-handed. I told him, 'You mean ambidextrous, coach?'": "Peyton",
  "With high fashion, it's a performance. You're trying to interpret a fantasy in a very physical way, and you really are playing a character. I've played men, dead people, famous people, historical icons, and it's no mean feat. It's quite an insular experience even though the crowd is in front of you and there's an expectation.": "Erin",
  "One thing about D.C. that's funny to me is that you end up running into famous political figures who you've seen on television who you think are not real until you see them.": "Maz",
  "I am not famous at all.": "Sam",
  "I like celebrities. I love people who are famous. Always have.": "Elaine",
  "It may sound strange to say it of someone so famous, but I think Leonardo DiCaprio is underrated, particularly from an awards perspective. He is a very versatile actor. He started very young, and 'What's Eating Gilbert Grape?' is one of my favourite films.": "Will",
  "My goal was just to work regularly. I didn't ever expect to be rich or famous. I wanted to be a working character actor.": "Harrison",
  "I'm busier than ever and it's led to new opportunities. But I've never worried about being rich or famous - for me, it's all about the dancing.": "Anton",
  "'Strictly' is a bit like scoring the winning goal in the FA Cup Final or sinking the final putt in the Ryder Cup - only a few people get the opportunity to do it, and they have got to be famous.": "Anton",
  "Having been part of this wonderful show ever since series one, I know all too well what it's like to perform to the nation on the famous 'Strictly Come Dancing' dancefloor.": "Anton",
  "I didn't get into writing to make money or get famous or any of that. I got into it to hit hearts, and man, when I get letters not just from the soldiers but from their kids, especially their kids, it makes it all worthwhile.": "Tim",
  "Look at Jessica Simpson. She's famous for being dumb. I guess it started with Marylyn Monroe, and she actually wasn't that dumb, but that's how she was perceived - and that's what got popular.": "Danica",
  "One of the strengths of the DC Universe has been the strength of the rogues' gallery. Often times they're as famous - if not more infamous - than our heroes.": "Jim",
  "The Famous Amos Chocolate Chip Cookie was an unexpected, unplanned pop culture phenomena. My father went from star-maker to star.": "Shawn",
  "While not a musician, my father was a music agent for years before becoming pop culture icon Famous Amos.": "Shawn",
  "Of course, screwed up families are not the exclusive province of the famous. Still, most families get to screw up in private.": "Shawn",
  "On an emotional level, success in America would be terrible for me; it would be insane. I really, seriously, never want to be famous here.": "Robbie",
  "I have only one ambition, which is to be famous.": "Robbie",
  "I just want to make music, I don't want people to talk about me. All I've ever wanted to do was sing. I don't want to be a celebrity. I don't want to be in people's faces, you know, constantly on covers of magazine that I haven't even known I'm on.": "Adele",
  "You do not want to get married at 22! Especially if you're famous, because girls are going to be throwing themselves at you.": "Usain",
  "I would sing to my Beanie Babies, and I sort of created this alternate universe where I was famous, and there were thousands of people that I was singing to.": "Mary",
  "I am not hugely famous; I am not a name. For me, it's not the size of the role, it's the material and the people you are working with.": "Ruth",
  "I didn't become an actor to make money. And I didn't become an actor to be famous - though people always gasp if you say that, as if it's unfathomable that an actor doesn't want to be a star.": "Ruth",
  "A famous love story is hard to maintain when you both live in the spotlight.": "Lauren",
  "I am not a famous person at home - I'm just a guy here. I'm a father, I'm a companion, I'm a human being. I am not a public figure in my house; I am not a celebrity. I am not a famous person to myself - I am just a guy.": "William",
  "It took me a long time to realize you don't choose what you're famous for.": "D.",
  "I'm right on the edge of getting another movie. It's between me and a famous person. The studio said they're thinking about going with somebody with a name. I said, 'That's great! Because I have one!'": "Bonnie",
  "The most famous actress who did the 'dumb blond' routine was Marilyn Monroe, but she was a genius actress.": "Nikolaj",
  "Well I would say that we're regular people first of all and we're normal and it's obvious by some of the things that have happened just because our name is famous we're not immune to tragedy.": "Brett",
  "Being a famous actress may give you a sense of being important, but believe me, it's just an illusion.": "Juliette",
  "It's never been my purpose to become an American icon, or more famous or richer.": "Juliette",
  "I thought I'd get over being insecure if I became famous, but it hasn't happened. It just gets worse, really. You get more and more on edge, more nervous. These are all the things I'm dealing with. You think if you get famous, fear will go away and problems will go away. But they don't.": "Christian",
  "A lot of producers get famous because they decide to be superstars for their own reasons, but I'm inspired by Timbaland and Pharrell and Swizz Beatz 'cause they're doing things that are so different. I like how they're introducing ideas I never would have thought of.": "Diplo",
  "Good bands won't get famous anymore unless they get really lucky.": "Diplo",
  "Many people don't know our famous 'soup kitchen' episode on Seinfeld was inspired by an actual soup restaurant off 8th Avenue in New York.": "Jason",
  "My family has existed in eastern Kentucky for as long as there are records. If you're familiar with the famous Hatfield-McCoy family feud back in the 1860s, '70s and '80s in the United States, my family was an integral part of that.": "J.",
  "It amazes me when I hear people say, 'I want to go out and find out who I am.' I always knew who I was. I was going to be famous if it killed me.": "Chuck",
  "I grew up in the limelight and being the child of someone famous. So my relationship with fame is not bedazzled.": "Lupita",
  "I got the famous Oprah hug!": "Taylor",
  "Barack Obama is the most famous living person in the history of the world.": "Dee",
  "There's such big pressure on people who are incredibly famous, on those who have people sitting outside their front door and taking photos every time they move.": "Miranda",
  "I know I had my equivalents in Adrian Lester and Lenny James when I was at drama school. I remember David Harewood doing 'Othello' at the National, and Adrian Lester having done Cheek by Jowl's famous 'As You Like It and Company' at the Donmar. Not necessarily performances I saw, but just the fact they happened was massively encouraging.": "David",
  "People are getting famous now for serving food out of a truck, or for, well, pork buns. I don't know if I'm really pleased to be a part of that. I'm somewhat terrified of what the future holds, especially in America.": "David",
  "I was thinking about it: so many of my stories are about my family life, not about being related to a lot of famous people. That's my grandma, that's my mama, my daddy, my aunt, my uncle, my stepdaddy. I'd probably tell them even if they weren't well known.": "Carlene",
  "I hear the way people talk about the children of famous people. They're not treated very well. The presumptions are usually quite awful. So I tried to establish myself with a couple of movies. After 'Juno' I thought: 'I think I've defined myself enough as my own director that I'd love to work with my father.'": "Jason",
  "I was a latchkey kid, so when I saw the 'Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous,' that showed me that there was a different type of lifestyle out there. I was curious about it and amazed about it.": "Loni",
  "I'm not a very good impersonator, my friends maybe, but not famous people.": "Diane",
  "I've been very, very lucky in my career, in my life - from day one. When aspiring directors say, 'What's your advice?' first I say, 'Be born the son of a famous director. It's invaluable.'": "Jason",
  "The stones themselves are thick with history, and those cats that dash through the alleyways must surely be the ghosts of the famous dead in feline disguise.": "Erica",
  "Famous people complain about fame, but they never want to give it back, myself included.": "Erica",
  "I became very famous, as a teenager, and my name and photo were splashed in all the media. They made me larger than life, so I wanted to live larger than life, and the only way to do that was to be intoxicated.": "Cat",
  "I used to be like everyone else and think the Kardashians are just famous for being famous. But I've been really impressed with how supportive Kim Kardashian has been of Caitlyn Jenner.": "Anne",
  "I have a great job writing for 'The Office,' but, really, all television writers do is dream of one day writing movies. I'll put it this way: At the Oscars the most famous person in the room is, like, Angelina Jolie. At the Emmys the huge exciting celebrity is Bethenny Frankel. You get what I mean.": "Mindy",
  "I was a guy who wanted to become famous. There was steam coming out of my ears, I wanted to be famous so badly. You want the attention, you want the bucks, and you want the best seat in the restaurant. I didn't think what the repercussions would be.": "Matthew",
  "If I hadn't had the experience of being famous, I would have searched for it my whole life. I would have just gone on and on trying to find it.": "Matthew",
  "I am an unusual Irishman. I'm probably Ireland's third most famous Jewish son.": "Lenny",
  "On the banks of the Nile, the Rosetta branch, I lived an enjoyable childhood in the City of Disuq, which is the home of the famous mosque, Sidi Ibrahim.": "Ahmed",
  "Barack Obama hopes his famous health care victory will mark him as a transformative president. History, however, may judge it to have been his missed opportunity to be one.": "George",
  "In 'A Few Best Men,' I play a lesbian character. I played the lesbian sister of the bride who ends up kissing a dude at the end, but she was, like, a full-on lesbian in that. And I beat out famous Australian lesbians for the role.": "Rebel",
  "Celebrity damages private life.": "Tim",
  "It was deeply important for me to understand where Mandela came from. Because we know where he was going, and that's a famous story, but who was he? Where did he come from? What was his upbringing?": "Idris",
  "As communicators and marketers, people are so accustomed to thinking from the 'top down.' Finding the great analyst or the famous journalist who will endorse what you do and tell the rest of the world to go and buy your product.": "Guy",
  "I really feel like it's a travesty to make a child famous. I really do.": "Joe",
  "I had a sense of who I was before I got famous.": "Joe",
  "I can't advise any of the young ones, because I don't know what their background was, but I would suggest that anyone who wants to be famous more than anything - there's a real problem.": "Shirley",
  "Yeah, I like to be the maker of the art. And I like and want the money. But I don't really dig being famous.": "Liz",
  "io9 was the last standalone site that Gawker Media ever launched. It was born at a time when many of the company's other famous sites, from Consumerist and Wonkette to Fleshbot and Idolator, were being sold off or shuttered.": "Annalee",
  "I played old men back in drama school. It's just now that I'm drawing level with the age of the characters I play, but I'm fine with that, and I've certainly never envied people who became hugely famous when they were young.": "Paul",
  "Nobody sane wants just to be famous.": "Jamie",
  "There is a misleading, unwritten rule that states if a quote giving advice comes from someone famous, very old, or Greek, then it must be good advice.": "Bo",
  "If you think Abraham Lincoln became famous for inventing the town car, it is time to spend a few hours on history.": "Bo",
  "I never cultivated a personality. Almost everyone who is really famous has cultivated a personality.": "Val",
  "There are hundreds of Frank Lloyd Wright buildings around the United States and in other countries, too. Wright lived into his 90s, and one of his most famous buildings, the Guggenheim Museum in New York, was completed just before his death. Wright buildings look like Wright buildings - that is their paradox.": "Jane",
  "I went to Iceland in 1861 and went over nearly every bit of the ground made famous by the adventures of Grettir.": "Sabine",
  "Hollywood's famous for putting you in a box.": "Mickey",
  "I never wanted to be famous. It was amusing at first, but now I hate it. I just wanted to be respected by people I respect. And I wanted to be rich. It's best to get rich, then you can do what you want.": "Caitlin",
  "I hate that tabloid idea of anybody who is famous having to forfeit their privacy.": "Caitlin",
  "When you work with actors, what you're hoping to absorb is good ways to be an actor as opposed to how to handle being famous.": "Domhnall",
  "I don't think about being famous, really. Being an author, I don't generally get stopped as I walk down the street. It's not like being a movie star.": "Rick",
  "I'd rather be able to face myself in the bathroom mirror than be rich and famous.": "Ani",
  "My mother's father was from Brazil - a painter, and not a famous one - and was always broke. But he was a free spirit, a great grandfather.": "Claire",
  "I think anytime with your mom, whether she's famous or not, you're watching what she's doing when you're growing up. She also taught me the basics: Make sure you use a good moisturizing shampoo and conditioner, and then use a detangler to comb through your hair. And don't overdo the heat styling.": "Jillian",
  "I've never seen the allure of being famous, because I know what that's like. It's part of work.": "Jillian",
  "My mother has been famous for longer than anyone else alive.": "Anderson",
  "I don't ever want to be famous. I never want to live that life. I genuinely hate the fact that I would be stopped for a picture or an autograph all the time.": "Charlotte",
  "That's why success hasn't changed me: because I don't want to be famous or do TV or be a model or be recognised in a shop. I'm not interested. There's nothing worse.": "Charlotte",
  "I'm trying to be a working actor. I'm not in pursuit of fame. I'm not trying to be in the kinds of films that make you famous like that.": "Sarah",
  "I pride myself in being an aficionado of the British seaside. Throughout my career, I have visited and worked in many of the famous British resorts, from Great Yarmouth to Largs.": "Martin",
  "The dream of any scholar has, for me, come true by virtue of this award. The Nobel Prizes are justly famous in the hard sciences, in literature, and for peace.": "Paul",
  "Comedy has to be done en clair. You can't blunt the edge of wit or the point of satire with obscurity. Try to imagine a famous witty saying that is not immediately clear.": "James",
  "But I know newspapers. They have the first amendment and they can tell any lie knowing it's a lie and they're protected if the person's famous or it's a company.": "Steve",
  "Imagine if baseball were taught the way science is taught in most inner-city schools. Schoolchildren would get lectures about the history of the World Series. High school students would occasionally reproduce famous plays of the past. Nobody would get in the game themselves until graduate school.": "Alison",
  "As he approached his 28th birthday in February 1840, Dickens knew himself to be famous, successful and tired. He needed a rest, and he made up his mind to keep the year free of the pressure of producing monthly installments of yet another long novel.": "Claire",
  "I didn't necessarily want to be famous growing up, but I knew I would be a good famous person because I'm not offended if somebody comes up to me and knows things about me and wants to engage me in a conversation.": "Nate",
  "I didn't grow up thinking I'd be a decorator. Design is my greatest passion, and it naturally just pulled me down the path. Same with TV. Being famous or having a show was never the motivation. I got a call and was swept up by the challenge of that first small space redesign.": "Nate",
  "Now, we believe that the majority of teachers in America know our system must be reformed, to put students first so that America can compete, that teachers don't teach to become rich or famous. They teach because they love children.": "Chris",
  "I think I'll always be famous. I just hope I don't become infamous.": "CeeLo",
  "Music definitely gave me a focus. I was an artist without an outlet. Let's just say if I was not famous, I could have been infamous. I could've had my own episode of 'American Gangster.'": "CeeLo",
  "Honestly, this face of mine will always be familiar to people. It's that unique quality, man. If it's a dark and crowded room, people are just able to point me out. I think I'll always be famous. I just hope I don't become infamous.": "CeeLo",
  "Because I think in order to get famous you have to be known for something. Like 'You're the romantic comedy girl' or 'You're the Oscar-winning whatever girl.'": "Rachel",
  "I want to be so famous that I'm the pop-culture reference that people would make to try and be racist to me. So I'd be walking down the street, and someone would be, like, 'Hey, look at this Kumail Nanjiani.'": "Kumail",
  "I was there when the quote-unquote golden age of musical theater was flourishing. I met everybody who worked in theater or was famous in theater from the '40s on.": "Harold",
  "It's great - that's the best part about being famous is that people want to get to know me. People come up to me and introduce themselves, and I make friends, and then I meet their friends. It seems like I have a very happy and comfortable social life, which is something I never had when I was younger.": "Rivers",
  "I realise there's an innate paradox in promoting oneself on the one hand and saying, 'Oh, I don't want to be famous,' on the other.": "Romola",
  "Despite the metadata attached to each tweet, and despite trails of retweets and 'favorite' tweets, the Twitter corpus lacks the latticework of hyperlinks that makes Google's algorithms so potent. Twitter's famous hashtags - #sandyhook or #fiscalcliff or #girls - are the crudest sort of signposts, not much help for smart searching.": "James",
  "A lot of people these days are not music lovers - they just want to be famous which is a very different thing to what I grew up believing in.": "Shirley",
  "On the Italian side, we can trace the family back 2,000 years. I have a cousin in Rome, a famous archaeologist, Count Andrea Carandini, who was in Lombardy and came across some pottery with the original name of the family, Carandinus, painted on it.": "Christopher",
  "My great-grandmother was born in London, the daughter of a Brixton coachman, and became the most famous singer in Australia. Her name was Marie Carandini, Madame Carandini.": "Christopher",
  "That's what we were exploring on 'Larry Sanders' - the human qualities that have brought us to where we are now in the world: the addiction to needing more and wanting more and talking more. We were examining the labels put on success - is it successful to be on TV every day, to be famous, to have a paycheck?": "Garry",
  "If I wasn't even famous or had any success, I would still wake up and put tons of make-up on, and put on a cool outfit. That's always been who I've been my whole life, so that's never gonna change. I love fashion. I love getting dressed up. I love Halloween, too.": "Gwen",
  "I don't want to create controversy; I just have an opinion on things, and there is nothing wrong with stating your opinion if you are asked. Everyone wants that right, and because you are famous doesn't mean you have less of a right.": "John",
  "I mean I was famous for nothing.": "Rick",
  "I am not a name-dropper. I can't help it if everybody I know is famous.": "Zsa",
  "I wanted to be famous. I wanted people to talk about me.": "Haile",
  "A talk show is about having a look at a famous face, a bit of stand-up comedy, knockabout stuff - an interview is what Barbara Walters or Connie Chung does in the States, in-depth, done properly.": "Terry",
  "There's nothing to be said for being famous. It's a pain. You can't be rude to people - it's inexcusable not to be nice. Anyway, it's not in my nature. I was trained to be nice.": "Terry",
  "I won't share everything, both in my act or in interviews. Some of the people who become the most famous are the most self-revelatory, and I'm like, 'No, it's just not worth it to me.'": "Nick",
  "The love of the famous, like all strong passions, is quite abstract. Its intensity can be measured mathematically, and it is independent of persons.": "Susan",
  "My summer reading suggestion: Pick a really famous, really long novel.": "Maria",
  "When I was 18, my mum gave me all the clothes she'd had made at the famous haute couture fashion label, House of Worth, in Paris. Of course, I eventually trashed them all.": "Trinny",
  "I have this fascination with being on the road, all things music, and the '70s. My favorite movie is 'Almost Famous.'": "Brittany",
  "I think I was lucky to be a little older when I became famous. But still, the shock of the world starting to treat you in a weird way... I had come from the army, where we had to deal with life or death, and suddenly, people were asking whether you were cool or not. I have never cared about whether I'm cool.": "James",
  "I'm glad that my parents missed one thing that was really unbelievable. They saw me hit this great success. It was a blast and we had a lot of laughs. And it was just an amazing time. They passed away. And then after I got, you know, famous, all these haters came out of nowhere.": "Dane",
  "I was famous in a way that was kind of terrifying. I had no protection. When reporters showed up at my house, there wasn't even a sidewalk. They were literally parked on my front lawn.": "Marcia",
  "I don't want to end up being a circus act, doing my most famous tricks when I'm 70.": "Pharrell",
  "Even famous poets such as Marianne Moore and William Carlos Williams were rarely asked to read their poems.": "Donald",
  "I have seen so many poets who were famous, who won all sorts of prizes, disappear with their death. I write as good as I can and don't try to turn that into some hope for a future that I could never know.": "Donald",
  "Even as a kid, I never wanted to be famous; I wanted to be good.": "Neil",
  "After a fellow gets famous it doesn't take long for someone to bob up that used to sit by him in school.": "Kin",
  "It's hard to say I don't like being famous, but how I feel is that I don't see myself as that person. It baffles me that people would want a picture with me.": "Anthony",
  "To be a star is to own the world and all the people in it. After a taste of stardom, everything else is poverty.": "Hedy",
  "It's no good singing if you just want to be a pop star; you've got to work at it and do it for the love for it, not because you think it will make you famous.": "Bonnie",
  "I've been singing since I was 16 because I love it - I wanted to be a singer, not a star. There's a difference between wanting to be famous and wanting to sing well.": "Bonnie",
  "I know I have this level of celebrity, of fame, international, national, whatever you want to call it, but it's a pretty surreal thing to think sometimes that you're in the middle of another famous person's life and you think to yourself, 'How the hell did I get famous? What is this some weird club that we're in?'": "Kevin",
  "I've only ever wanted to be a singer I never wanted to be famous. ": "Katherine",
  "I never dreamt of being a musician for my livelihood. I certainly never would have wanted to be in the business that I'm in, meaning the fame and the glory, the glitter, the rock star, the famous part.": "Eddie",
  "I'm famous today. People like me today. Might not like me tomorrow. You can't count on it.": "Dave",
  "I love being famous - it's phenomenal.": "Dave",
  "Being famous is great, it's not like bad or horrible or anything.": "Dave",
  "I worked at a hot dog place, a bagel place, the Jersey Store and the hottest fashion joint around. I was getting too famous to work there anymore. I was almost showing up as a joke. I made $2,000 on my show the previous night and I'm going to go shopping during my five-hour shift.": "Wale",
  "I'm sick to death of famous people standing up and using their celebrity to promote a cause. If I see a particular need, I do try to help. But there's a lot that can be achieved by putting a check in the right place and shutting up about it.": "Russell",
  "'Swallow My Gift' is all about music being its own reward. I don't do it to become more famous I don't do it to make money. I don't do it from an ego-driven point of view. ": "Russell",
  "There's a famous artist, Ron English, in New York, that just, or Andy Warhol for that matter, that did pop art that terrorized society. And that's, for the last like 10, 15 years, that's all I wanted to do, is terrorize society and make them look into a mirror and see what the hell we have wrought.": "Al",
  "I've never dated anyone in Hollywood - or anyone famous, for that matter. I don't know that I'm ever gonna write a song that you will know who it's about.": "Ed",
  "I'm a big soccer fan, so any soccer player that I meet, I always get star struck. I've met a lot of big stars - Justin Timberlake, Michael Buble - and I don't ever get starstruck, but when I met famous ex-football players, I just got completely starstruck.": "Olly",
  "Who elected Larry King America's grief counselor? We, the viewing public, did, by driving up his ratings whenever somebody famous passes.": "James",
  "Vine is where 'Don't' started popping off. A lot of famous Viners used the song, and that was crazy because I had never been a part of something like that. I drank champagne for the first time when it got 100,000 plays.": "Bryson",
  "Nothing in life prepares you to be famous.": "Jeff",
  "Although I was born to famous parents, I know and feel the problems of ordinary citizens.": "Benigno",
  "The thing that most critics miss about Faulkner is that his famous storytelling voice is, in fact, a standard Southern storytelling voice that is typical of the Gulf Coast - Mississippi, Alabama and so on.": "Gregory",
  "When I was a kid, I would come home from school, and my mom would buy the industrial-size Famous Amos cookies or Chips Ahoy when I was lucky. And I would sit in front of the TV set with a glass of milk... and I would dump cookies in there, smash them with my spoon, and eat cookies and milk with a spoon watching 'The Dukes of Hazzard.'": "Johnny",
  "I know really, really famous people who are terrified every time they walk on to a stage.": "Bill",
  "I'm not famous for my back story investigations I'm lucky that I work with good writers and it's usually in the script. ": "Bill",
  "I loved cowboy films and TV series, and I learned bits of English from them. My favorite was 'Laramie', with Robert Fuller and John Smith. I used to watch 'The Lone Ranger', which had been famous in Japan as well. I idolized these cowboys.": "Kazuo",
  "I feel like everyone has the right to privacy, even if you're the most famous person in the world.": "Marina",
  "I didn't even listen to any music until I was 19, really. I just wanted to be famous. But I didn't say it to anyone because I was really embarrassed at the thought.": "Marina",
  "The Kardashians can be famous for being famous. What do they do? I can't figure it out.": "Larry",
  "Bill Cosby is a famous black guy who has a bully pulpit the size of the world; it's global. He puts his colossal foot on the vulnerable necks of poor people, and as a result of that, we don't have a balanced conversation.": "Michael",
  "Never, never have a famous partner. It's too complicated.": "Robyn",
  "I grew up with a pretty tough mom. She was a self-appointed neighborhood watchdog, and if she saw that any of the local boys were up to no good, she would scold them on the spot. Although she is only 5 feet 2, she was famous in our neighborhood for intimidating men three times her size and getting them to do the right thing.": "Hanna",
  "Fame necessarily isn't really tied to success at all. Fame is just being recognized for doing what you do, whether it's good or bad. Osama bin Laden was famous.": "Big",
  "There's the famous thing that the A&R man from the record company is supposed to do: He's supposed to come into the studio and listen to the songs you've been recording and then say, 'Guys, I don't hear any singles.' And then everybody falls into a terrible depression because you have to write one.": "Jarvis",
  "I think basically becoming famous has taken the place of going to Heaven in modern society, hasn't it? That's the place where your dreams will come true. It's an act of faith now; they think that's going to sort things out.": "Jarvis",
  "As a shy kid growing up in Sheffield, I fantasized about how it would be great to be famous so I wouldn't actually have to talk to people and feel awkward. And of course, as we all know from fairy stories, when you achieve that ambition, you find out you don't want it.": "Jarvis",
  "I know I'm not supposed to have any opinions about politics, because I'm famous.": "Cher",
  "I've been famous my entire life I don't know any other way. ": "Cher",
  "There aren't many downsides to being rich, other than paying taxes and having relatives asking for money. But being famous, that's a 24 hour job right there.": "Bill",
  "I've had to deal, a lot, with my own sense of intimidation at meeting famous people - especially actors, but really any famous people.": "Charlie",
  "My mom just didn't put a very high premium on me being like really famous or really wealthy or anything.": "Martha",
  "I made myself famous by writing 'songs' and lyrics about the beauty of the things I did and ugliness, too.": "Jack",
  "Luckily, I think, I never really wanted to be famous, I just wanted to make movies.": "Seth",
  "I remember, when I was an up-and-coming comic, how annoyed I would be when the famous guys would show up and just take everyone's spots.": "Seth",
  "The good thing about L.A. is that there's always someone more famous 100 yards away from me.": "Seth",
  "I wanted to sing when I was little. That's what I liked doing. It didn't occur to me that you became famous or anything like that.": "Linda",
  "I didn't think I was a famous singer. I didn't think I was a star or that I could make the waters part - just that singing was what I was going to do.": "Linda",
  "I was famous overnight. I went from nowhere to being really big.": "Sting",
  "I didn't have any aspirations of becoming famous or successful; in fact I was scared to death of all that. I remember somebody once said that if a rock musician goes on tour, he goes insane. I was very impressionable and I carried this useless weight of fear around with me about going on tour, all because of this thing somebody said.": "Steve",
  "When you look at Michael Jackson, there's nobody who loves him in that family, nobody. If they did, they'd tell him he didn't have to do all that in order to be famous. All he has to do is keep doing his music and be himself. Michael's been a little touched for about 20 years, but somebody needs to pull him aside and tell him they love him.": "Jamie",
  "Although I get so much fan mail from Great Britain, tell me, am I more famous there than Michael Madsen?": "Tom",
  "In a school where everyone is famous or rich or whatever, you have a culture, 'What does your dad do?' 'What does your mom do?'": "Cynthia",
  "I would like to prove that on TV, everyday lives can be as compelling as the life-styles of the rich and famous. Especially lives that we catch at extraordinary moments.": "Jane",
  "I want to become more famous, even more famous.": "Yayoi",
  "I'm working on bridging the gap between mainstream famous and Internet famous. They're two different things, but eventually, social media will be the way to become a celebrity.": "Cameron",
  "Anytime you cast a movie and you need someone famous in the lead part, you're a prisoner of whoever happens to be famous in the six-month window in which you're trying to get a film financed.": "Alexander",
  "Dad was always that way: who's the candidate that's best for this country? We can debate theology later - that was his famous line. I kind of feel like that's in my DNA.": "Jerry",
  "I became famous so quickly and so young - it was daunting. I was immature and I used to say some really stupid things in interviews. I never smiled on stage so I looked really serious, but it was because I hated my teeth and was incredibly nervous.": "Gary",
  "Some people can't sing - like honestly - but they're famous anyway, and they might be famous for being an artist, which is completely different from being a singer.": "Zara",
  "It's difficult for me to trust a woman. Men are attracted to beautiful women. Women are attracted to men who offer security - financial security. And if you have money and you're famous, women find that sexy.": "Curtis",
  "Ever since grammar school, I knew I wanted to be famous - I always wanted to be a singer.": "Jennifer",
  "Becoming famous is a strange thing in your own right.": "Carnie",
  "My mother was a famous photographer for actresses, including Sophia Loren, Gina Lollobrigida, and so many. I remember I went to school close to my mother's studio, and for years, I went to the studio after school and just watched how she captured these beauties.": "Dario",
  "I took classical piano for a couple of years, but I sort of lost interest - I couldn't read a note today if I tried. I still enjoy that stuff, and I think I naturally gravitate towards the classical licks; in fact, I know that I do. I gravitate towards the classical licks that I heard by famous old composers.": "Tom",
  "People will ask, 'Are you famous?' And I always answer, 'My mother thinks so.'": "Yo-Yo",
  "The most famous rumor for me is that I had throat cancer. I never had throat cancer... I don't know why that started... The way I sing, probably.": "Bob",
  "Some of the most famous books are the least worth reading. Their fame was due to their having done something that needed to be doing in their day. The work is done and the virtue of the book has expired.": "Moliere",
  "You meet people in Hollywood that are famous, and you're not sure what they got famous for.": "Rainn",
  "I don't see myself as famous at all so I'm continuing my life as normal.": "Ashley",
  "A lot of people have the misconception that I decided to become an actor when Lily became famous and have accused me of jumping on her bandwagon. But that's completely untrue.": "Alfie",
  "I'd had people say, 'You'll enjoy being famous for a week, and you'll never enjoy it again'. But I don't think I had that week. I may have been working and missed that moment.": "Matt",
  "I fell in love with a civilian. Not an actress and not a famous actress at that. Because then the attention doesn't double - it grows exponentially. Because then suddenly everybody wants to be in your bedroom. But I don't really give them anything.": "Matt",
  "I was famous from the age of 13, and after a while you become immune to it - in a good way. You look at positives and what you can do with it.": "A.",
  "It is more interesting to be compared to someone famous, because it lets you gauge what perceptions people have about your appearance.": "Arthur",
  "We need to teach our kids, because there is such a celebrity culture at the moment, that however rich you are, however famous you are, however glamorous you are, everyone has to live by the same rules.": "Nick",
  "Britain is famous for being great at inventing and poor at commercializing.": "Margaret",

  "I find that my entire life has come to me, and things happened without me planning them. You know, I never asked to photograph Princess Diana, and that made me more famous than I wanted. I never asked to photograph Madonna, and that pushed me to another level. There are things that just take you into the limelight.": "Mario",
  "There's always going to be that pressure when you're in front of the camera. When you're famous it's just an extreme version of reality and there's a pressure to look a certain way.": "Geri",

  "Major success feels a bit like a coronation. Like I'd become a king. I was one of the most famous people in the world, loved and hated in equal measure. I couldn't see anything bad with it. It made me a happy person.": "Larry",
  "It wasn't being an alcoholic - it was going wild. It happened when I got famous. It was like having my teens in my early thirties: blotting out your life, not having to think about anything.": "Julie",
  "I remember Michael saying, 'Rich and famous? It's much better to be just rich'. I didn't quite get it to begin with. But he's right. You lose anonymity. I say to my family that you've no idea until you lose it how precious anonymity is.": "Julie",

  "I don't mean being famous is a perk, because one knows that it's not necessarily a perk, but there are certain perks to being well-known and respected in one's field. Public perks. Like, I don't know, general friendliness and willingness to please, just to point out two.": "Emma",

  "My mum lives in Boston; she's famous for teaching wushu and t'ai chi. So from when I was young, my mum and aunt were like: 'You're training; you're not playing baseball or football.' Training every day was normal. Later, when I was almost a teenager, Bruce Lee became my idol.": "Donnie",

  "When you're famous, you're always famous. It doesn't go away.": "Bob",
  "Celebrity is a word that I find offensive. That's the c-word. I hate it. It means no discernible talent. It means all you want is to be famous. It doesn't mean you're a writer, an actor, a mime. I think I wanna not be a celebrity.": "Bob",

  "The Obama administration has turned a blind eye to radical Islam since before they came to office. If you look at everything that's transpired since the famous Cairo speech in 2009, it's all been an embrace of those who are the most radical elements in that part of the world. That is not a good sign for America's foreign policy.": "Oliver",
  "The only reason I became the singer in the band is because I sang the best. It wasn't out of some desire to be a star or be a famous singer. It's not like I love interviews.": "Adam",
  "I would love to do a biopic of a famous singer, like Diana Ross or Donna Summer, or an old jazz story that we haven't seen before. I would love to do that! I would love to play Diana Ross 'cause she's an icon. I'm salivating to do that.": "Taraji",
  "I think Dutch people are very sober. I don't know if it's the right word. Like, you have the most famous person walk by some Dutch people, and they're like, 'Oh, hello.'

  "I really hate the duties of being a celebrity, like getting dressed up for the red carpet.": "America",
  "When I started out as a model, I took things for granted. Because I bagged work thanks to my looks, I didn't give my body any importance. I was a couch potato who'd eat anything. Then, in 2005, a tabloid ran a story calling me fat. I thought, 'I'm famous. How can I be fat?' It was a slap. I decided to get fit.": "Bipasha",

  "I think that children that are acting are always pretty savvy anyway because you're conducting yourself around adults a lot of the time, aren't you? But there is this worry now that children just want to be famous.": "Ashley",
  "I just wanted to be an actress. It never occurred to me that I could become famous, because I'm not one of those people who's automatically going to be the lead. I always saw myself as the mate.": "Ashley",

  "Quentin is very organic; there was no way that he was going to put someone else's hand in there and anyway, my hands are kind of famous. It seemed right.": "David",

  "It's more important for me to feel content than to be famous.": "Samantha",
  "'Blanche' opened a new door for me without really making me more famous. 'Blanche' was a risk, but that is the only thing that excites me in this profession. The knowledge that I am an actress who takes risks lifts my soul.": "Lou",
  "I'm in my father's car at age 9 or 10 crying to Leonard Cohen's 'Famous Blue Raincoat,' thinking that you could write nearly a love letter to a man who betrayed you by having an affair with your wife. I was thinking how wonderful and pure music can be for explaining situations.": "Lou",
  "A lot of what gets on the radio isn't saying anything other than somebody wants to be famous and will do whatever they're told to get it.": "Kacey",
  "I think it would collapse my heart if I was super famous. I don't have the nerve for it, I'm too anxious. I don't know how you're not obsessed with how people perceive you, because they're real people, you know? You can convince yourself that they don't really know you, and that's true, but how can it not hurt your feelings?": "Bo",

  "I don't think I'll ever feel as famous or as popular as I felt when I was a 17-year-old soccer player in Modle. Only about 20,000 people live there and 12,000 of them come to every game. Running onto the pitch each week was just the most fantastic feeling. Nothing can beat that.": "Jo",

  "You do stand-up because you have to do it. If you're doing it to become 'famous,' you're wrong. If you're doing it to become a millionaire, you're doing it for the wrong reasons.

  "I put my money in the bank: I have to think of life after modeling, when I'm not famous any more.": "Eva",
  "Celebrity culture, it's everywhere, isn't it? It's reality TV, Big Brother. I didn't become a footballer to be famous, I became a footballer to be successful. I didn't want to be famous. Now people want to be famous. Why? Why would you want people following you about all day?": "Ryan",

  "I don't really know a lot of famous people. I've met a lot of famous people. If I ran into Tom Hanks today, I would have to remind him who I was and he would then remember me. But he wouldn't come up to me and say, 'Hi Dave!'": "David",

  "Celebrity, to me, is not a thing to seek.": "Aidan",
  "Celebrity gives us delusion of self importance.": "Al",
  "My wife, she is so good. She was a famous singer - had a show in Carnegie Hall, did a big city tour for RCA. Then she made the mistake of marrying me. The next year, another tour, but the third year, she had Mario and said, 'Either I'm a mother or a singer.'": "Sirio",

  "There's so many things I want to do. I want to work with great filmmakers, great actors, great scripts. And there's no reason for me to do anything short of that, because I'm 24, I don't have a family, I don't need to make tons of money, and I'm not dying to get famous.": "Tobey",

  "I pretended to be somebody I wanted to be until finally I became that person. Or he became me.": "Cary",
  "When you become famous, you start getting invites to parties where there are famous athletes and famous rock stars, politicians, people who have tremendous power and affluence. It's not in my DNA, but certainly I have been exposed to it.": "Billy",
  "I grew up with a lot of people who are famous now. I was friends with Hilary and Haley Duff. They are such lovely girls. I have watched their careers blossom, which I am really happy for. I grew up with Ashley Tisdale; we used to both live in Valencia, so we used to hang out back in the day.": "Madeline",
  "One of the differences between real documentaries and reality television, besides the artificial construct of reality television, is that the people who are recruited to be on those shows, and the people who are interested in going on those shows, basically want to be famous.

  "The Bronx is famous for two things. Hip-hop, and 26 world championships.": "Kurtis",
  "I don't feel I was ever a 'famous' child actor. I was just a working actor who happened to be a kid. I was never really in a hit show until I was a teenager with West Wing playing First Daughter Zoey Bartlet. In a way, that was my saving grace - not being a star on a hit show. It kept me working and kept me grounded.": "Elisabeth",

  "I didn't want to be famous. I just wanted to earn enough money to have a nice life and enjoy acting.": "David",

  "There is no celebrity quite as powerful as the local, homegrown celebrity.": "Tony",

  "If you're famous, you're not free.": "Tadanobu",
  "In the U.S. there are many people willing to work on $9 per hour, which is causing Tasmania to lose its famous apple industry and Australia to import more and more of its fruit and food from lower cost countries. In fact, all over Australia there are warning signs of us killing or restricting our own industries.": "Gina",

  "Keep close to Nature's heart... and break clear away, once in awhile, and climb a mountain or spend a week in the woods. Wash your spirit clean.": "John",
  "So many times, people told me I can't do this or can't do that. My nature is that I don't listen very well. I'm very determined, and I believe in myself. My parents brought me up that way. Thank God for that. I don't let anything stand in my way.": "Chantal",

  "I know the lands are lit, with all the autumn blaze of Goldenrod.": "Helen",

  "Going to the woods is going home, for I suppose we came from the woods originally.

  "Nothing is art if it does not come from nature.": "Antoni",
  "Spring is nature's way of saying, 'Let's party!'": "Robin",
  "I have lived pain, and my life can tell: I only deepen the wound of the world when I neglect to give thanks the heavy perfume of wild roses in early July and the song of crickets on summer humid nights and the rivers that run and the stars that rise and the rain that falls and all the good things that a good God gives.": "Ann",
  "A forest bird never wants a cage.": "Henrik",
  "The year 2100 will see eugenics universally established. In past ages, the law governing the survival of the fittest roughly weeded out the less desirable strains. Then man's new sense of pity began to interfere with the ruthless workings of nature. As a result, we continue to keep alive and to breed the unfit.": "Nikola",
  "All the seven deadly sins are man's true nature. To be greedy. To be hateful. To have lust. Of course, you have to control them, but if you're made to feel guilty for being human, then you're going to be trapped in a never-ending sin-and-repent cycle that you can't escape from.": "Marilyn",
  "As a spiritual person, nature for me has always been a healing place. Going back all the way to my childhood on the farm, the fields and forests were places of adventure and self-discovery. Animals were companions and friends, and the world moved at a slower, more rational pace than the bustling cities where I'd resided my adult life.": "David",
  "Human nature is complex. Even if we do have inclinations toward violence, we also have inclination to empathy, to cooperation, to self-control.": "Steven",

  "Nothing makes me so happy as to observe nature and to paint what I see.": "Henri",
  "It is not only fine feathers that make fine birds.": "Aesop",
  "Nature is impersonal, awe-inspiring, elegant, eternal. It's geometrically perfect. It's tiny and gigantic. You can travel far to be in a beautiful natural setting, or you can observe it in your backyard - or, in my case, in the trees lining New York City sidewalks, or in the clouds above skyscrapers.": "Gretchen",
  "Loss is nothing else but change, and change is Nature's delight.": "Marcus",
  "God and Nature first made us what we are, and then out of our own created genius we make ourselves what we want to be. Follow always that great law. Let the sky and God be our limit and Eternity our measurement.": "Marcus",
  "The rainbow is a part of nature, and you have to be in the right place to see it. It's beautiful, all of the colors, even the colors you can't see. That really fit us as a people because we are all of the colors. Our sexuality is all of the colors. We are all the genders, races, and ages.": "Gilbert",
  "Another thing I like to do is sit back and take in nature. To look at the birds, listen to their singing, go hiking, camping and jogging and running, walking along the beach, playing games and sometimes being alone with the great outdoors. It's very special to me.": "Larry",

  "It is not my nature, when I see a people borne down by the weight of their shackles - the oppression of tyranny - to make their life more bitter by heaping upon them greater burdens; but rather would I do all in my power to raise the yoke than to add anything that would tend to crush them.": "Abraham",
  "Learn from nature. Stuff lives and stuff dies all the time, you know. Animals and birds and flowers. Trees come and go, and we come and go. That's it. So we should all seize life and make the most of what we have while we can.": "Joanna",
  "Nature's great masterpiece, an elephant; the only harmless great thing.": "John",

  "Wolves and women are relational by nature, inquiring, possessed of great endurance and strength. They are deeply intuitive, intensely concerned with their young, their mate and their pack.

  "Migration is as natural as breathing, as eating, as sleeping. It is part of life, part of nature. So we have to find a way of establishing a proper kind of scenario for modern migration to exist. And when I say 'we,' I mean the world. We need to find ways of making that migration not forced.": "Gael",
  "Everybody makes mistakes, but when goalkeepers make them, it is costly. That's the nature of being a goalkeeper.": "Gary",

  "I'm a real nature lover, so whenever possible, I like to get to the beach or get to a forest or get somewhere there's fresh air. Apart from that, I'm a film addict and a DVD freak.": "Murray",
  "The history of science shows that theories are perishable. With every new truth that is revealed we get a better understanding of Nature and our conceptions and views are modified.": "Nikola",
  "Literature is the expression of a feeling of deprivation, a recourse against a sense of something missing. But the contrary is also true: language is what makes us human. It is a recourse against the meaningless noise and silence of nature and history.": "Octavio",

  "People need to be cautious because anything built by man can be destroyed by Mother Nature.": "Russel",
  "Mistakes are almost always of a sacred nature. Never try to correct them. On the contrary: rationalize them, understand them thoroughly. After that, it will be possible for you to sublimate them.": "Salvador",
  "Man is fully responsible for his nature and his choices.": "Jean-Paul",

  "I hold grudges, but I can't hate nobody; that's not my nature.": "The",

  "Communism is in conflict with human nature.": "Ernest",
  "Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time.": "William",
  "Economic medicine that was previously meted out by the cupful has recently been dispensed by the barrel. These once unthinkable dosages will almost certainly bring on unwelcome after-effects.

  "The moon looks upon many night flowers the night flowers see but one moon. ": "Jean",
  "Trying to understand the way nature works involves a most terrible test of human reasoning ability. It involves subtle trickery, beautiful tightropes of logic on which one has to walk in order not to make a mistake in predicting what will happen. The quantum mechanical and the relativity ideas are examples of this.": "Richard",
  "Agriculture changes the landscape more than anything else we do. It alters the composition of species. We don't realize it when we sit down to eat, but that is our most profound engagement with the rest of nature.": "Michael",

  "Painting is by nature a luminous language.": "Robert",
  "Were I called on to define, very briefly, the term Art, I should call it 'the reproduction of what the Senses perceive in Nature through the veil of the soul.' The mere imitation, however accurate, of what is in Nature, entitles no man to the sacred name of 'Artist.'": "Edgar",

  "Sunlight is painting.": "Nathaniel",
  "I don't like formal gardens. I like wild nature. It's just the wilderness instinct in me, I guess.": "Walt",

  "It is not the language of painters but the language of nature which one should listen to, the feeling for the things themselves, for reality is more important than the feeling for pictures.": "Vincent",
  "Sailing is the closest I can get to nature - it's adrenaline, fear, a constant challenge and learning experience, an adventure into the unknown. And of course there is nothing better than wearing the same T-shirt for days and not brushing my hair for weeks.": "Daria",

  "In nature we never see anything isolated, but everything in connection with something else which is before it, beside it, under it and over it.": "Johann",
  "To be admitted to Nature's hearth costs nothing. None is excluded, but excludes himself. You have only to push aside the curtain.": "Henry",
  "Nature doesn't need people - people need nature; nature would survive the extinction of the human being and go on just fine, but human culture, human beings, cannot survive without nature.": "Harrison",

  "Anything created by human beings is already in the great book of nature.": "Antoni",
  "This is a day of little faith - of few convictions - a day when men seem to have no great causes and no great passions. So in frustration, in disappointment, they are inclined to say, 'You can't change human nature.' It is true that we cannot change human nature. But God can.": "Peter",
  "When we think of the major threats to our national security, the first to come to mind are nuclear proliferation, rogue states and global terrorism. But another kind of threat lurks beyond our shores, one from nature, not humans - an avian flu pandemic.": "Barack",
  "Whenever I get fed up with life I love to go wandering in nature.": "Andrea",
  "Even when I see a beautiful woman, I think, 'Aw, her life must be amazing.' Everyone does it. That's human nature to believe that beauty is everything.": "Marina",

  "Everyone can identify with a fragrant garden, with beauty of sunset, with the quiet of nature, with a warm and cozy cottage.": "Thomas",

  "See that the imagination of nature is far, far greater than the imagination of man.": "Richard",
  "Knowledge doesn't really form part of human nature. Conflict, combat, the outcome of the combat, and, consequently, risk and chance are what gives rise to knowledge. Knowledge is not instinctive; it is counter instinctive, just as it is not natural but counter natural.": "Michel",
  "All my life through, the new sights of Nature made me rejoice like a child.": "Marie",
  "Fraternity among nations, however, touches the deepest desire of human nature.": "Hjalmar",

  "Let us learn to appreciate there will be times when the trees will be bare, and look forward to the time when we may pick the fruit.": "Anton",

  "And the heart that is soonest awake to the flowers is always the first to be touch'd by the thorns.": "Thomas",

  "Even in winter an isolated patch of snow has a special quality.": "Andy",
  "Art is the right hand of Nature. The latter has only given us being, the former has made us men.": "Friedrich",
  "Everything is political. I will never be a politician or even think political. Me just deal with life and nature. That is the greatest thing to me.": "Bob",
  "By 'justice', I understand nothing more than that bond which is necessary to keep the interest of individuals united, without which men would return to their original state of barbarity. All punishments which exceed the necessity of preserving this bond are, in their nature, unjust.": "Cesare",

  "The very nature of science is discoveries, and the best of those discoveries are the ones you don't expect.": "Neil",

  "Although our intellect always longs for clarity and certainty, our nature often finds uncertainty fascinating.": "Carl",
  "We live on a planet that is amazing, beautiful, and full of wonder but not protected from powerful destructive forces of nature. We are capable of doing wonderful and selfless things but also self-absorbed and harmful things. This is the world we live in.": "Adam",

  "If you can't sit in a cafe quietly and be ignored, how can you observe human nature and write a story?": "Evangeline",
  "What I call my 'self' now is hardly a person at all. It's mainly a meeting place for various natural forces, desires, and fears, etcetera, some of which come from my ancestors, and some from my education, some perhaps from devils. The self you were really intended to be is something that lives not from nature but from God.": "C.",
  "There is no doubt that breath control is the means for mind control because the mind, like breath, is a part of air; because the nature of mobility is common to both; because the place of origin is the same for both; and because when one of them is controlled, the other gets controlled.": "Ramana",
  "I sit astride life like a bad rider on a horse. I only owe it to the horse's good nature that I am not thrown off at this very moment.": "Ludwig",
  "One of the first conditions of happiness is that the link between Man and Nature shall not be broken.": "Leo",
  "Nature is my manifestation of God. I go to nature every day for inspiration in the day's work. I follow in building the principles which nature has used in its domain.": "Frank",

  "Trees love to toss and sway they make such happy noises. ": "Emily",
  "I did not want to be a tree, a flower or a wave. In a dancer's body, we as audience must see ourselves, not the imitated behavior of everyday actions, not the phenomenon of nature, not exotic creatures from another planet, but something of the miracle that is a human being.": "Martha",
  "It is the nature of babies to be in bliss.": "Deepak",
  "Men are by nature merely indifferent to one another but women are by nature enemies. ": "Arthur",

  "When I have a terrible need of - shall I say the word - religion. Then I go out and paint the stars.": "Vincent",
  "Everything that slows us down and forces patience, everything that sets us back into the slow circles of nature, is a help. Gardening is an instrument of grace.": "May",
  "Sweeter than the perfume of roses is a reputation for a kind, charitable, unselfish nature; a ready disposition to do to others any good turn in your power.": "Orison",
  "An attack upon our ability to tell stories is not just censorship - it is a crime against our nature as human beings.": "Salman",
  "Such is the nature of men, that howsoever they may acknowledge many others to be more witty, or more eloquent, or more learned; yet they will hardly believe there be many so wise as themselves.": "Thomas",
  "Nature is full of genius, full of the divinity; so that not a snowflake escapes its fashioning hand.": "Henry",
  "The artist is the confidant of nature, flowers carry on dialogues with him through the graceful bending of their stems and the harmoniously tinted nuances of their blossoms. Every flower has a cordial word which nature directs towards him.": "Auguste",
  "We still carry this old caveman-imprint idea that we're small, nature's big, and it's everything we can manage to hang on and survive. When big geophysical events happen - a huge earthquake, tsunami, or volcanic eruption - we're reminded of that.": "James",
  "Nature shows that with the growth of intelligence comes increased capacity for pain, and it is only with the highest degree of intelligence that suffering reaches its supreme point.": "Arthur",
  "Wars will remain while human nature remains. I believe in my soul in cooperation, in arbitration; but the soldier's occupation we cannot say is gone until human nature is gone.": "Rutherford",
  "Modern morality and manners suppress all natural instincts, keep people ignorant of the facts of nature and make them fighting drunk on bogey tales.": "Aleister",
  "All art is but imitation of nature.": "Lucius",
  "I don't think homosexuality is a choice. Society forces you to think it's a choice, but in fact, it's in one's nature. The choice is whether one expresses one's nature truthfully or spends the rest of one's life lying about it.": "Marlo",

  "Suffering is permanent, obscure and dark, And shares the nature of infinity.": "William",
  "A true nature is a gloomy monolith, sort of like that old black rotary phone that I had to sing 'Happy Birthday' to Grandpa on. But novelists, damn us, still need true natures - so we can give them to our protagonists. And so readers can vaguely predict how they'll behave when we trap them in 'situations' that they can't IM their way out of.": "Walter",
  "Most of us who become experimental physicists do so for two reasons; we love the tools of physics because to us they have intrinsic beauty, and we dream of finding new secrets of nature as important and as exciting as those uncovered by our scientific heroes.": "Luis",
  "Humans have certain properties and characteristics which are intrinsic to them, just as every other organism does. That's human nature.": "Noam",
  "Biodiversity can't be maintained by protecting a few species in a zoo, or by preserving greenbelts or national parks. To function properly, nature needs more room than that. It can maintain itself, however, without human expense, without zookeepers, park rangers, foresters or gene banks. All it needs is to be left alone.": "Donella",
  "Nature study will show you how full of beautiful and wonderful things God has made the world for you to enjoy. Be contented with what you have got and make the best of it. Look on the bright side of things instead of the gloomy one.": "Robert",
  "In northern architecture - the cathedrals of Europe and all the little churches - the details, the carving of stone, become necessary because the light is not there to help you very much. You have to enrich surfaces. The desert reduces form to its simplest nature. There is no need for gargoyles or flying buttresses in the desert.": "I.",

  "In Japan, I was immensely impressed by the politeness, industrious nature and conscientiousness of the Japanese people.": "J.",

  "If nothing else, the act of reaching a milestone often serves to reveal a superstar's true nature.": "Stephen",
  "I am not a religious person myself, but I did look for nature. I had spent my first sabbatical in New York City. Looked for something different for the second one.

  "We live in a very chaotic world that sometimes we - it just seems like a mess.

  "Military deployments have never been something to enjoy, but the consequence of the actions, the shared nature of the sacrifices, and the nobility of the cause are invigorating.

  "How are the faculties of man to be best developed and his happiness secured? The state of a king is not favorable to this, nor the state of the noble and rich men of the earth.

  "If you look at the common denominator of all the comics who have had big success, it's being true to their nature... that's what takes a long time to learn.": "Ron",
  "In interior decorating, the pig's actually quite there. It's used in paint for the texture, but also for the glossiness.

  "Science is fun. Science is curiosity. We all have natural curiosity. Science is a process of investigating. It's posing questions and coming up with a method. It's delving in.": "Sally",
  "Science is beautiful when it makes simple explanations of phenomena or connections between different observations. Examples include the double helix in biology and the fundamental equations of physics.": "Stephen",
  "Once you have an innovation culture, even those who are not scientists or engineers - poets, actors, journalists - they, as communities, embrace the meaning of what it is to be scientifically literate. They embrace the concept of an innovation culture. They vote in ways that promote it. They don't fight science and they don't fight technology.": "Neil",
  "Our scientific power has outrun our spiritual power. We have guided missiles and misguided men.": "Martin",
  "To raise new questions, new possibilities, to regard old problems from a new angle, requires creative imagination and marks real advance in science.": "Albert",
  "Science means constantly walking a tightrope between blind faith and curiosity; between expertise and creativity; between bias and openness; between experience and epiphany; between ambition and passion; and between arrogance and conviction - in short, between an old today and a new tomorrow.": "Heinrich",
  "Research is what I'm doing when I don't know what I'm doing.": "Wernher",
  "Science and technology revolutionize our lives, but memory, tradition and myth frame our response.": "Arthur",

  "The science tells us that if we fail to reduce global warming pollution, global temperatures will rise to dangerous levels and unleash devastating extreme weather events and accelerate destructive sea level rise.": "Frances",
  "There is no science in this world like physics. Nothing comes close to the precision with which physics enables you to understand the world around you. It's the laws of physics that allow us to say exactly what time the sun is going to rise. What time the eclipse is going to begin. What time the eclipse is going to end.": "Neil",
  "Genetic engineering is a result of science advancement, so I don't think that in itself is bad. If used wisely, genetics can be beneficial, but they can be abused, too.": "Hideo",
  "The function of sociology, as of every science, is to reveal that which is hidden.": "Pierre",

  "At its heart, engineering is about using science to find creative, practical solutions. It is a noble profession.": "Queen",
  "A scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it.": "Max",
  "Science is what you know, philosophy is what you don't know.": "Bertrand",
  "Ignorance more frequently begets confidence than does knowledge: it is those who know little, and not those who know much, who so positively assert that this or that problem will never be solved by science.": "Charles",
  "Science fiction is any idea that occurs in the head and doesn't exist yet, but soon will, and will change everything for everybody, and nothing will ever be the same again. As soon as you have an idea that changes some small part of the world you are writing science fiction. It is always the art of the possible, never the impossible.": "Ray",
  "We are born at a given moment, in a given place and, like vintage years of wine, we have the qualities of the year and of the season of which we are born. Astrology does not lay claim to anything more.": "Carl",
  "My social philosophy may be said to be enshrined in three words: liberty, equality and fraternity. Let no one, however, say that I have borrowed by philosophy from the French Revolution. I have not. My philosophy has roots in religion and not in political science. I have derived them from the teachings of my Master, the Buddha.": "B.",
  "Travel stories teach geography; insect stories lead the child into natural science; and so on. The teacher, in short, can use reading to introduce her pupils to the most varied subjects; and the moment they have been thus started, they can go on to any limit guided by the single passion for reading.": "Maria",
  "Medicine is not only a science; it is also an art. It does not consist of compounding pills and plasters; it deals with the very processes of life, which must be understood before they may be guided.": "Paracelsus",
  "To me, mathematics, computer science, and the arts are insanely related. They're all creative expressions.": "Sebastian",

  "Our vision is to rediscover the spirit of the Renaissance, create a new discipline where engineering for cultural heritage is actually a symbol of blending art and science together.": "Maurizio",
  "All science is either physics or stamp collecting.": "Ernest",
  "Science is not only a disciple of reason but, also, one of romance and passion.": "Stephen",
  "Neuroscience is by far the most exciting branch of science because the brain is the most fascinating object in the universe. Every human brain is different - the brain makes each human unique and defines who he or she is.": "Stanley",
  "The true teachers and educators are not those who have learned pedagogy as the science of dealing with children, but those in whom pedagogy has awakened through understanding the human being.": "Rudolf",
  "There's nothing I believe in more strongly than getting young people interested in science and engineering, for a better tomorrow, for all humankind.": "Bill",

  "We live in this world in order always to learn industriously and to enlighten each other by means of discussion and to strive vigorously to promote the progress of science and the fine arts.": "Wolfgang",
  "Usually, girls weren't encouraged to go to college and major in math and science. My high school calculus teacher, Ms. Paz Jensen, made math appealing and motivated me to continue studying it in college.": "Ellen",
  "Science is a way of life. Science is a perspective. Science is the process that takes us from confusion to understanding in a manner that's precise, predictive and reliable - a transformation, for those lucky enough to experience it, that is empowering and emotional.": "Brian",
  "Just as the science and art of agriculture depend upon chemistry and botany, so the art of education depends upon physiology and psychology.": "Edward",
  "Mars is the only place in the solar system where it's possible for life to become multi-planetarian.": "Elon",

  "Advertising is fundamentally persuasion and persuasion happens to be not a science, but an art.": "William",
  "I hated science in high school. Technology? Engineering? Math? Why would I ever need this? Little did I realize that music was also about science, technology, engineering and mathematics, all rolled into one.": "Mickey",

  "I don't believe in the Great Man theory of science or history. There are no great men, just men standing on the shoulders of other men and what they have done.": "Jacque",
  "No great advance has been made in science, politics, or religion without controversy.": "Lyman",
  "What use could the humanities be in a digital age? University students focusing on the humanities may end up, at least in their parents' nightmares, as dog-walkers for those majoring in computer science. But, for me, the humanities are not only relevant but also give us a toolbox to think seriously about ourselves and the world.": "Nicholas",
  "Scientists have become the bearers of the torch of discovery in our quest for knowledge.": "Stephen",
  "Biochemistry is the science of life. All our life processes - walking, talking, moving, feeding - are essentially chemical reactions. So biochemistry is actually the chemistry of life, and it's supremely interesting.": "Aaron",
  "Statistics is the grammar of science.": "Karl",
  "Anthropology is the science which tells us that people are the same the whole world over - except when they are different.": "Nancy",

  "In the big picture, architecture is the art and science of making sure that our cities and buildings fit with the way we want to live our lives.": "Bjarke",
  "I actually started off majoring in computer science, but I knew right away I wasn't going to stay with it. It was because I had this one professor who was the loneliest, saddest man I've ever known. He was a programmer, and I knew that I didn't want to do whatever he did.": "J.",
  "People think that computer science is the art of geniuses but the actual reality is the opposite, just many people doing things that build on eachother, like a wall of mini stones.": "Donald",
  "Is there anything science should not try to explain? Science is knowledge and knowledge is power - power to do good or evil. Sometimes ignorance is bliss.": "Paul",
  "The science of operations, as derived from mathematics more especially, is a science of itself, and has its own abstract truth and value.": "Ada",
  "There is no science in creativity. If you don't give yourself room to fail, you won't innovate.": "Bob",
  "We live in a time when science is validating what humans have known throughout the ages: that compassion is not a luxury; it is a necessity for our well-being, resilience, and survival.": "Joan",
  "Science can purify religion from error and superstition. Religion can purify science from idolatry and false absolutes.": "Pope",
  "Vaccines and antibiotics have made many infectious diseases a thing of the past we've come to expect that public health and modern science can conquer all microbes. But nature is a formidable adversary. ": "Tom",
  "Science is a wonderful thing if one does not have to earn one's living at it.": "Albert",

  "I am among those who think that science has great beauty.": "Marie",
  "Evolution is the fundamental idea in all of life science - in all of biology.": "Bill",
  "The kitchen's a laboratory, and everything that happens there has to do with science. It's biology, chemistry, physics. Yes, there's history. Yes, there's artistry. Yes, to all of that. But what happened there, what actually happens to the food is all science.": "Alton",

  "The difference between science and the arts is not that they are different sides of the same coin even, or even different parts of the same continuum, but rather, they are manifestations of the same thing. The arts and sciences are avatars of human creativity.": "Mae",
  "In science, we must be interested in things, not in persons.": "Marie",
  "Music is not math. It's science. You keep mixing the stuff up until it blows up on you, or it becomes this incredible potion.": "Bruno",
  "Science is the father of knowledge, but opinion breeds ignorance.": "Hippocrates",
  "Mathematical science shows what is. It is the language of unseen relations between things. But to use and apply that language, we must be able fully to appreciate, to feel, to seize the unseen, the unconscious.": "Ada",
  "Science cannot progress without reliable and accurate measurement of what it is you are trying to study. The key is measurement, simple as that.": "Robert",
  "Medical science has proven time and again that when the resources are provided, great progress in the treatment, cure, and prevention of disease can occur.": "Michael",

  "There is a single light of science, and to brighten it anywhere is to brighten it everywhere.": "Isaac",
  "All science requires mathematics. The knowledge of mathematical things is almost innate in us. This is the easiest of sciences, a fact which is obvious in that no one's brain rejects it; for laymen and people who are utterly illiterate know how to count and reckon.": "Roger",
  "I found that people like rules, and I love to tell people what to do. It's not rocket science when it comes to weight loss. It's about eating a little less and moving a little bit more.": "Bob",
  "Many who have had an opportunity of knowing any more about mathematics confuse it with arithmetic, and consider it an arid science. In reality, however, it is a science which requires a great amount of imagination.": "Sofia",
  "Adventure upon all the tickets in the lottery, and you lose for certain; and the greater the number of your tickets the nearer your approach to this certainty.": "Adam",
  "Part of what made the Macintosh great was that the people working on it were musicians, poets, and artists, and zoologists, and historians. They also happened to be the best computer scientists in the world. But if it hadn't been computer science, these people would have been doing amazing things in other fields.": "Steve",
  "I think of it as a good opportunity to let, in particular, school kids know that this job and other interesting jobs in science and engineering are open to anyone who works hard in school and gets a good education and studies math and science. And that it's not just for a select group of people.": "Ellen",
  "Software Engineering might be science; but that's not what I do. I'm a hacker, not an engineer.": "Jamie",
  "It has become almost a cliche to remark that nobody boasts of ignorance of literature, but it is socially acceptable to boast ignorance of science and proudly claim incompetence in mathematics.": "Richard",
  "Science is the search for truth, that is the effort to understand the world: it involves the rejection of bias, of dogma, of revelation, but not the rejection of morality.": "Linus",
  "I'm not much of a math and science guy. I spent most of my time in school daydreaming and managed to turn it into a living.": "George",
  "Some say they see poetry in my paintings I see only science. ": "Georges",
  "I do not recognize the right of the public to break in the front door of a man's private life in order to satisfy the gaze of the curious... I do not think it right to dissect living men even for the advancement of science. So far as I am concerned, I prefer a post mortem examination to vivisection without anaesthetics.": "Alexander",
  "Unlike science, creationism cannot predict anything, and it cannot provide satisfactory answers about the past.": "Bill",
  "There are two things I enjoy most about my work. First, I get to work with interesting and enthusiastic people who are also fired up about science. Second, every once in a while I have moments in which I suddenly understand the solution to a problem that I've been working on - those are great moments.": "David",
  "Biology is the science. Evolution is the concept that makes biology unique.": "Jared",
  "Science is the captain, and practice the soldiers.": "Leonardo",
  "When we see the shadow on our images, are we seeing the time 11 minutes ago on Mars? Or are we seeing the time on Mars as observed from Earth now? It's like time travel problems in science fiction. When is now; when was then?": "Bill",
  "The method of political science is the interpretation of life; its instrument is insight, a nice understanding of subtle, unformulated conditions.": "Woodrow",
  "Raising children is a creative endeavor, an art rather than a science.": "Bruno",
  "The conscience of the world is so guilty that it always assumes that people who investigate heresies must be heretics; just as if a doctor who studies leprosy must be a leper. Indeed, it is only recently that science has been allowed to study anything without reproach.": "Aleister",
  "In science there is only physics all the rest is stamp collecting. ": "Lord",
  "It is science, and not religion, which has taught men that things are complex and difficult to understand.": "Emile",
  "Science, as illustrated by the printing press, the telegraph, the railway, is a double-edged sword. At the same moment that it puts an enormous power in the hands of the good man, it also offers an equal advantage to the evil disposed.": "Richard",
  "Science is magic that works.": "Kurt",
  "I feel like the thing we can do is celebrate people doing great work and create more cultural momentum and awareness that this is an important thing in the world. So when the next economic crisis hits and people are talking about where to cut from the budget, science isn't the thing.": "Mark",
  "The science of the mind can only have for its proper goal the understanding of human nature by every human being, and through its use, brings peace to every human soul.": "Alfred",
  "There's no question that as science, knowledge and technology advance, that we will attempt to do more significant things. And there's no question that we will always have to temper those things with ethics.": "Ben",
  "The thing I have discovered about working with personal finance is that the good news is that it is not rocket science. Personal finance is about 80 percent behavior. It is only about 20 percent head knowledge.": "Dave",
  "The whole of science, and one is tempted to think the whole of the life of any thinking man, is trying to come to terms with the relationship between yourself and the natural world. Why are you here, and how do you fit in, and what's it all about.": "David",
  "'Snow White' is an old fairy tale, so obviously the idea of vanity and obsession with youth is long-standing. With today's science, people have become crazy with trying to move their face around. It's bizarre.": "Julia",
  "I felt that chess... is a science in the form of a game... I consider myself a scientist. I wanted to be treated like a scientist.": "Bobby",
  "The heart of science is measurement.": "Erik",
  "There does not exist a category of science to which one can give the name applied science. There are science and the applications of science, bound together as the fruit of the tree which bears it.": "Louis",
  "Transhumanism is the ethics and science of using things like biological and genetic engineering to transform our bodies and make us a more powerful species.": "Dan",
  "Mild autism can give you a genius like Einstein. If you have severe autism, you could remain nonverbal. You don't want people to be on the severe end of the spectrum. But if you got rid of all the autism genetics, you wouldn't have science or art. All you would have is a bunch of social 'yak yaks.'": "Temple",
  "Science provides an understanding of a universal experience. Arts provide a universal understanding of a personal experience.": "Mae",
  "If an elderly but distinguished scientist says that something is possible, he is almost certainly right; but if he says that it is impossible, he is very probably wrong.": "Arthur",
  "To begin with, we put the proposition: pure phenomenology is the science of pure consciousness.": "Edmund",
  "Architecture is a science arising out of many other sciences, and adorned with much and varied learning; by the help of which a judgment is formed of those works which are the result of other arts.": "Vitruvius",
  "I hate to tell you this, but you will never actually go to a galaxy far, far away and encounter Darth Vader. That's science fiction; it isn't going to happen.": "Margaret",
  "Most great advances have been a collaboration. That is the joy of science for me.": "Tim",
  "As long as men are free to ask what they must, free to say what they think, free to think what they will, freedom can never be lost and science can never regress.": "Marcel",
  "But man has still another powerful resource: natural science with its strictly objective methods.": "Ivan",
  "A permanent base on Mars would have a number of advantages beyond being a bonanza for planetary science and geology. If, as some evidence suggests, exotic micro-organisms have arisen independently of terrestrial life, studying them could revolutionise biology, medicine and biotechnology.": "Paul",
  "One of the most interesting things about science fiction and fantasy is the way that the genres can offer different perspectives on matters to do with the body, the mind, medical technology, and the way we live our lives.": "Tansy",
  "There are no shortcuts in evolution.": "Louis",
  "Science is simply common sense at its best, that is, rigidly accurate in observation, and merciless to fallacy in logic.": "Thomas",
  "We can lick gravity, but sometimes the paperwork is overwhelming.": "Wernher",
  "Why do we do basic research? To learn about ourselves.": "Walter",
  "Sadly, embryonic stem cell research is completely legal in this country and has been going on at universities and research facilities for years.": "Mike",
  "Scientific research is one of the most exciting and rewarding of occupations.": "Frederick",
  "Perfect as the wing of a bird may be, it will never enable the bird to fly if unsupported by the air. Facts are the air of science. Without them a man of science can never rise.": "Ivan",
  "Cooking is for chefs. Science informs us and lets us cook while knowing what we are doing, but it is not a replacement for the skills of a chef.": "Nathan",
  "A fool's brain digests philosophy into folly, science into superstition, and art into pedantry. Hence University education.": "George",
  "Science is the best idea humans have ever had. The more people who embrace that idea, the better.": "Bill",
  "The main purpose of science is simplicity and as we understand more things, everything is becoming simpler.": "Edward",
  "We're as clever as we think we are, but we'll be a lot cleverer when we learn to use not just one brain but to pool huge numbers of brains. We're at a level technologically where we can share information and think collectively about our problems. We do it in science all the time - there's no reason why we can't do it in other endeavors.": "Lewis",
  "I've always felt that the human-centered approach to computer science leads to more interesting, more exotic, more wild, and more heroic adventures than the machine-supremacy approach, where information is the highest goal.": "Jaron",
  "False facts are highly injurious to the progress of science, for they often endure long; but false views, if supported by some evidence, do little harm, for every one takes a salutary pleasure in proving their falseness.": "Charles",
  "No science is immune to the infection of politics and the corruption of power.": "Jacob",
  "Skeptical scrutiny is the means, in both science and religion, by which deep thoughts can be winnowed from deep nonsense.": "Carl",
  "The product of mental labor - science - always stands far below its value, because the labor-time necessary to reproduce it has no relation at all to the labor-time required for its original production.": "Karl",
  "Science may be described as the art of systematic over-simplification.": "Karl",
  "The proper study of mankind is the science of design.": "Herbert",
  "I am aware of the usefulness of science to society and of the benefits society derives from it.": "Subrahmanyan",

  "The science linking the increased frequency and severity of extreme weather to the climate crisis has matured tremendously in the last couple of years.": "Al",
  "What has become clear from the science is that we cannot burn all of the fossil fuels without creating a very different planet.": "James",
  "Men have been obliged to make for themselves a notion of what religion is, long before the science of religions started its methodical comparisons.": "Emile",
  "Comparing science and religion isn't like comparing apples and oranges - it's more like apples and sewing machines.": "Jack",
  "I just had a crazy, wild imagination all my life, and science fiction is the greatest outlet for me.": "Steven",
  "The thrill of science is the process. It's a social process. It's a process of collective discovery. It's debate, it's experimentation and it's verification of claims that might be false. It's the greatest foundation for a society.": "Greg",
  "I think the least important thing about science fiction for me is its predictive capacity.": "William",
  "It is no coincidence that so many religious beliefs date back to times when no science could possibly have accounted satisfactorily for many of the natural phenomena inspiring scripture and myths.": "James",
  "Science is a first-rate piece of furniture for a man's upper chamber, if he has common sense on the ground-floor. But if a man hasn't got plenty of good common sense, the more science he has, the worse for his patient.": "Oliver",
  "You should never bet against anything in science at odds of more than about 1012 to 1.": "Ernest",
  "Religion is something left over from the infancy of our intelligence, it will fade away as we adopt reason and science as our guidelines.": "Bertrand",
  "Political ideology can corrupt the mind, and science.": "E.",
  "In contemporary art culture, where good looks and clever strategic planning of art careers have become a feature, professional practice may be taught in art schools like a branch of public relations or political science.": "Michael",
  "As a child I always steered clear of science fiction, but in the autumn of 1977, the bow-wave of publicity for the first 'Star Wars' movie had already reached me, so I was eager for anything science-fictional.": "Philip",
  "I read a book called 'The Tao of Physics' by Fritjof Capra that pointed out the parallels between quantum physics and eastern mysticism. I started to feel there was more to reality than conventional science allowed for and some interesting ideas that it hadn't got round to investigating, such as altered states of consciousness.": "Brian",
  "Science does not know its debt to imagination.": "Ralph",
  "Crucial to science education is hands-on involvement: showing, not just telling; real experiments and field trips and not just 'virtual reality.'": "Martin",
  "Science is the international language, so when we are able to convince countries that good decision-making for human health and animal health is based upon science, that's a real success story for us.": "Mike",

  "Every science begins as philosophy and ends as art.": "Will",
  "On the ordinary view of each species having been independently created, we gain no scientific explanation.": "Charles",

  "Geologists have a saying - rocks remember.": "Neil",
  "Science is like a love affair with nature; an elusive, tantalising mistress. It has all the turbulence, twists and turns of romantic love, but that's part of the game.": "Vilayanur",
  "Everything, however complicated - breaking waves, migrating birds, and tropical forests - is made of atoms and obeys the equations of quantum physics. But even if those equations could be solved, they wouldn't offer the enlightenment that scientists seek. Each science has its own autonomous concepts and laws.": "Martin",
  "My preparation is about precision. It is a science.": "Conor",
  "Science is the knowledge of consequences, and dependence of one fact upon another.": "Thomas",
  "In those parts of the world where learning and science has prevailed, miracles have ceased; but in those parts of it as are barbarous and ignorant, miracles are still in vogue.": "Ethan",
  "I have passed English medical examinations in Hong Kong... In my youth, I experienced overseas studies. The languages of the West, its literature, its political science, its customs, its mathematics, its geography, its physics and chemistry - all these I have had the chance to study.": "Sun",
  "Science may have found a cure for most evils but it has found no remedy for the worst of them all - the apathy of human beings. ": "Helen",
  "Every science has for its basis a system of principles as fixed and unalterable as those by which the universe is regulated and governed. Man cannot make principles he can only discover them. ": "Thomas",
  "It seems to me that socialists today can preserve their position in academic economics merely by the pretense that the differences are entirely moral questions about which science cannot decide.": "Friedrich",
  "Science always has its origin in the adaptation of thought to some definite field of experience.": "Ernst",
  "When I look upon seamen, men of science and philosophers, man is the wisest of all beings; when I look upon priests and prophets nothing is as contemptible as man.": "Diogenes",
  "Evolution seems to close the heart to some of the plainest spiritual truths while it opens the mind to the wildest guesses advanced in the name of science.": "William",
  "I used to think information was destroyed in black hole. This was my biggest blunder, or at least my biggest blunder in science.": "Stephen",
  "The world has changed - through technology, through wine-making techniques, the quality of wine is greater than it's ever been. Whereas ten, fifteen years ago it was very easy to find lots of bad wine, it's kind of hard now. The technology, the science - it's like, are you kidding? We're in the golden years of wine!": "Gary",
  "Electrical science has disclosed to us the more intimate relation existing between widely different forces and phenomena and has thus led us to a more complete comprehension of Nature and its many manifestations to our senses.": "Nikola",
  "For the future, primarily, we must educate people in science, engineering, technology and math.": "Buzz",
  "The success stories in biotechnology are mainly due to the straightforward application of design thinking in both the business and science aspects of our lean startups.": "Ryan",

  "If you're an adult and you choose not to believe in science, fine, but please don't prevent your children from learning about it and letting them draw their own conclusions.": "Bill",
  "I was always interested in animals, but when I was little, animal behavior was still a new science. It was available to become a veterinarian, it was available to study biology, but not specifically animal behavior. In the '60s, Jane Goodall was the founder of this new science.": "Isabella",
  "The Analytical Engine has no pretensions whatever to originate anything. It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform... But it is likely to exert an indirect and reciprocal influence on science itself.": "Ada",
  "Science is wonderfully equipped to answer the question 'How?' but it gets terribly confused when you ask the question 'Why?'": "Erwin",
  "I am not a scientist. I am, rather, an impresario of scientists.": "Jacques",
  "Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors. Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths, and encourage the arts and commerce.": "John",
  "Science investigates religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control. ": "Martin",
  "Reason, observation, and experience; the holy trinity of science.": "Robert",
  "It is inexcusable for scientists to torture animals let them make their experiments on journalists and politicians. ": "Henrik",

  "God may exist, but science can explain the universe without the need for a creator.": "Stephen",
  "The grand aim of all science is to cover the greatest number of empirical facts by logical deduction from the smallest number of hypotheses or axioms.": "Albert",
  "We have also arranged things so that almost no one understands science and technology. This is a prescription for disaster. We might get away with it for a while, but sooner or later this combustible mixture of ignorance and power is going to blow up in our faces.": "Carl",
  "Perhaps it would be better for science, that all criticism should be avowed.": "Charles",
  "My desire to be a physician had a lot to do with that sense of medicine as a ministry of healing, not just a science. And not even just a science and an art, but also a calling, also a ministry.": "Abraham",
  "For me, a good thriller must teach me something about the real world. Thrillers like 'Coma,' 'The Hunt for Red October' and 'The Firm' all captivated me by providing glimpses into realms about which I knew very little - medical science, submarine technology and the law.": "Dan",
  "It should be mandatory that you understand computer science.": "will.i.am",
  "Science is the most durable and nondivisive way of thinking about the human circumstance. It transcends cultural, national, and political boundaries. You don't have American science versus Canadian science versus Japanese science.": "Sam",
  "Ideologically, the pursuit of science is not that different from the ideology that goes into punk rock. The idea of challenging authority is consistent with what I have been taught as a scientist.": "Greg",
  "The biggest benefit of Apollo was the inspiration it gave to a growing generation to get into science and aerospace.": "Buzz",
  "I've actually started a number of businesses in my career. So I'm 28 currently, but when I was about 16, I started building Websites, and that's how I put myself through school. I went to Duke with a degree in electrical engineering, computer science, computer engineering, and then to Princeton.": "Aaron",
  "Curiosity - the rover and the concept - is what science is all about: the quest to reveal the unknown.": "Ahmed",
  "I like to learn. That's an art and a science.": "Katherine",
  "There are no such things as applied sciences, only applications of science.": "Louis",
  "Science is a differential equation. Religion is a boundary condition.": "Alan",
  "Art has a double face, of expression and illusion, just like science has a double face: the reality of error and the phantom of truth.": "Publilius",
  "Computer Science is embarrassed by the computer.": "Alan",
  "Knowledge of the sciences is so much smoke apart from the heavenly science of Christ.": "John",
  "Imagination is the key to my lyrics. The rest is painted with a little science fiction.": "Jimi",
  "Winning is the science of being totally prepared.": "George",
  "The more thoroughly I conduct scientific research, the more I believe that science excludes atheism.": "Lord",
  "The progress of science is strewn, like an ancient desert trail, with the bleached skeleton of discarded theories which once seemed to possess eternal life.": "Arthur",
  "Science rules!": "Bill",
  "The most watched programme on the BBC, after the news, is probably 'Doctor Who.' What has happened is that science fiction has been subsumed into modern literature. There are grandparents out there who speak Klingon, who are quite capable of holding down a job. No one would think twice now about a parallel universe.": "Terry",
  "I don't think immortality is necessarily the key to understanding the world. You have to be careful with what you think you're achieving. I'm all for science discovering amazing and fantastic things about our world, but I think the motivations behind it are slightly askew.": "Reggie",
  "There is no conflict between the ideal of religion and the ideal of science, but science is opposed to theological dogmas because science is founded on fact. To me, the universe is simply a great machine which never came into being and never will end. The human being is no exception to the natural order. Man, like the universe, is a machine.": "Nikola",
  "The science of psychology has been far more successful on the negative than on the positive side... It has revealed to us much about man's shortcomings, his illnesses, his sins, but little about his potentialities, his virtues, his achievable aspirations, or his psychological health.": "Abraham",
  "It was my dream to come to Oxford and study political science.": "Stormzy",
  "The work of science is to substitute facts for appearances, and demonstrations for impressions.": "John",
  "The foundation of empire is art and science. Remove them or degrade them, and the empire is no more. Empire follows art and not vice versa as Englishmen suppose.": "William",

  "Therefore, the good of man must be the end of the science of politics.": "Aristotle",
  "Leonardo Da Vinci combined art and science and aesthetics and engineering, that kind of unity is needed once again.": "Ben",
  "English is necessary as at present original works of science are in English. I believe that in two decades times original works of science will start coming out in our languages. Then we can move over like the Japanese.": "A.",
  "The further a mathematical theory is developed, the more harmoniously and uniformly does its construction proceed, and unsuspected relations are disclosed between hitherto separated branches of the science.": "David",
  "The problem is that no ethical system has ever achieved consensus. Ethical systems are completely unlike mathematics or science. This is a source of concern.": "Daniel",
  "Moral science is better occupied when treating of friendship than of justice.": "Thomas",
  "Blind faith, no matter how passionately expressed, will not suffice. Science for its part will test relentlessly every assumption about the human condition.": "E.",
  "It is through science that we prove, but through intuition that we discover.": "Henri",
  "Anecdotal thinking comes naturally science requires training. ": "Michael",
  "Yet higher religion, which is only a search for a larger life, is essentially experience and recognized the necessity of experience as its foundation long before science learnt to do so.": "Muhammad",
  "My entry into the environmental arena was through the issue that so dramatically - and destructively - demonstrates the link between science and social action: nuclear weapons.": "Barry",
  "Like all science, psychology is knowledge; and like science again, it is knowledge of a definite thing, the mind.": "James",
  "Experience by itself is not science.": "Edmund",
  "Pure phenomenology claims to be the science of pure phenomena. This concept of the phenomenon, which was developed under various names as early as the eighteenth century without being clarified, is what we shall have to deal with first of all.": "Edmund",
  "If the experience of science teaches anything, it's that the world is very strange and surprising. The many revolutions in science have certainly shown that.": "John",
  "I also think we need to maintain distinctions - the doctrine of creation is different from a scientific cosmology, and we should resist the temptation, which sometimes scientists give in to, to try to assimilate the concepts of theology to the concepts of science.": "John",
  "Ayurveda is a sister philosophy to yoga. It is the science of life or longevity and it teaches about the power and the cycles of nature, as well as the elements.": "Christy",
  "Freedom is absolutely necessary for the progress in science and the liberal arts.": "Baruch",
  "It vexes me when they would constrain science by the authority of the Scriptures, and yet do not consider themselves bound to answer reason and experiment.": "Galileo",

  "I do not believe in God; his existence has been disproved by Science. But in the concentration camp, I learned to believe in men.": "Jean-Paul",
  "Nothing matters but the facts. Without them, the science of criminal investigation is nothing more than a guessing game.": "Blake",
  "What we see today is an American economy that has boomed because of policies and developments of the 1950s and '60s: the interstate-highway system, massive funding for science and technology, a public-education system that was the envy of the world and generous immigration policies.": "Fareed",
  "This is a global fight to get the right people in the right place and we're talking about people with PhDs in engineering, computer science, mathematics.": "Jerry",
  "I am one of those scientists who feels that it is no longer enough just to get on and do science. We have to devote a significant proportion of our time and resources to defending it from deliberate attack from organised ignorance.": "Richard",
  "In Israel, a land lacking in natural resources, we learned to appreciate our greatest national advantage: our minds. Through creativity and innovation, we transformed barren deserts into flourishing fields and pioneered new frontiers in science and technology.": "Shimon",
  "We're not all equal, it's simply not true. That isn't science.": "James",
  "Well, logos is science or reason, something that helps us to function practically and effectively in the world, and it must therefore be closely in tune and reflect accurately the realities of the world around us.": "Karen",
  "If I say I am not a politician, it is because I did not go to school to do political science. But at the end of the day, I think we are all born politicians. It's practical. All you gotta do is practice.": "George",
  "The ability to take another perspective has become one of the keys to both sales and non-sales selling. And the social science research on perspective-taking yields some important lessons for all of us.": "Daniel",
  "I think we learn from medicine everywhere that it is, at its heart, a human endeavor, requiring good science but also a limitless curiosity and interest in your fellow human being, and that the physician-patient relationship is key; all else follows from it.": "Abraham",
  "I cannot stress often enough that what science is all about is not proving things to be true but proving them to be false.": "Lawrence",
  "To be creative means to connect. It's to abolish the gap between the body, the mind and the soul, between science and art, between fiction and nonfiction.": "Nawal",
  "All the traditional STEM fields, the science, technology, engineering, and math fields, are stoked when you dream big in an agency such as NASA.": "Neil",
  "My mother was a teacher, and when she wanted to show me art and literature and science, she'd take me to museums, parks and free exhibitions.": "David",
  "Science is not, despite how it is often portrayed, about absolute truths. It is about developing an understanding of the world, making predictions, and then testing these predictions.": "Brian",
  "Consciousness permits us to develop the instruments of culture - morality and justice, religion, art, economics and politics, science and technology. Those instruments allow us some measure of freedom in the confrontation with nature.": "Antonio",
  "If you look at any leaf on any tree branch, it's similar to but not exactly a repetition of the previous branch. So the new science of complexity or showing how an architecture can be produced just as quickly, cheaply and efficiently by using computer production methods to get the slight variation, the self-similarity.": "Charles",
  "Biologically inspired materials could revolutionize materials science. People looking at spider silk and abalone shells are looking for new ways to make materials better, cheaper, and with less toxic byproducts.": "Janine",
  "When it comes to art and science, people don't like a lot of either. Instead of being open to it, they're closed off about it.": "Tim",
  "Globalisation means many other countries are asserting themselves and trying to take over leadership. Please don't ask Americans to let others assume the leadership of human exploration. We can do wonderful science on the Moon, and wonderful commercial things. Then we can pack up and move on to Mars.": "Buzz",
  "Science has become politicized, and that's an embarrassment.": "Seth",
  "I say you don't need religion, or political ideology, to understand human nature. Science reveals that human nature is greedy and selfish, altruistic and helpful.": "Michael",
  "I think the combination of graduate education in a field like Computer Science and the opportunity to apply this in a work environment like Microsoft is what drove me. The impact these opportunities create can lead to work that has broad, worldwide impact.": "Satya",
  "I see every book as a problem that you have to solve. That is what dictates the form you use. It's not that you say, 'I want to write a science fiction book.' You start from the other end, and what you have to say dictates the form of it.": "Doris",
  "We think scientific literacy flows out of how many science facts can you recite rather than how was your brain wired for thinking. And it's the brain wiring that I'm more interested in rather than the facts that come out of the curriculum or the lesson plan that's been proposed.": "Neil",
  "If God is the mystery of the universe, these mysteries, we're tackling these mysteries one by one. If you're going to stay religious at the end of the conversation, God has to mean more to you than just where science has yet to tread.": "Neil",
  "What are we promoting in society? Well-behaved automatons that spew back what they learned in a book. That's not science. You can get a parrot to do that.": "Neil",
  "In the past, there was active discrimination against women in science. That has now gone, and although there are residual effects, these are not enough to account for the small numbers of women, particularly in mathematics and physics.": "Stephen",
  "I believe the universe is governed by the laws of science. The laws may have been decreed by God, but God does not intervene to break the laws.": "Stephen",
  "Throughout history, people have studied pure science from a desire to understand the universe rather than practical applications for commercial gain. But their discoveries later turned out to have great practical benefits.": "Stephen",
  "I do not know why I have always been fascinated by science or why I have been driven by the intense desire to make some original contribution. And although I have had some degree of success as a scientist, it is hard to say precisely why.": "Jack",
  "The constitution of the universe is total natural law. 'Natural law,' we say from the field of science. 'Will of God,' we say from the field of religion. It's the same thing.": "Maharishi",
  "Religion, art, and science flourish best in a free society. True, freedom does not afford much opportunity for grand gestures. It has little room for martyrs. But life is not supposed to be about dying well. It is about living well.": "Virginia",
  "I feel a connection to many songs that I won't sing because I don't think they are right for me! There is something in my gut that immediately responds. There's no science to it.": "Audra",
  "The Yankees, the first mechanicians in the world, are engineers - just as the Italians are musicians and the Germans metaphysicians - by right of birth. Nothing is more natural, therefore, than to perceive them applying their audacious ingenuity to the science of gunnery.": "Jules",
  "What is the intersection between technology, art and science? Curiosity and wonder, because it drives us to explore, because we're surrounded by things we can't see.": "Louie",
  "In England, an inventor is regarded almost as a crazy man, and in too many instances, invention ends in disappointment and poverty. In America, an inventor is honoured, help is forthcoming, and the exercise of ingenuity, the application of science to the work of man, is there the shortest road to wealth.": "Oscar",
  "I am honorary President of the American Humanist Society, having succeeded the late, great science fiction writer Isaac Asimov in that utterly functionless capacity. We Humanists behave as well as we can, without any rewards or punishments in an Afterlife.": "Kurt",
  "As a Humanist, I love science. I hate superstition, which could never have given us A-bombs.": "Kurt",
  "Studying organisms at a molecular level was totally compelling because it was moving from being a naturalist, which was the 19th-century kind of science, to being very focused and really getting to the heart of these molecules.": "Elizabeth",
  "I attended elementary school and high school in Mexico City. I was already fascinated by science before entering high school I still remember my excitement when I first glanced at paramecia and amoebae through a rather primitive toy microscope. ": "Mario",
  "Sir Isaac Newton gave the extraterrestrials their biggest shot in the arm when he embraced the infinite universe as the basis for his hugely influential system of physics. Even so, the aliens of the early modern period remained creatures of philosophy rather than science.": "Matthew",
  "GIS, in its digital manifestation of geography, goes beyond just the science. It provides us a framework and a process for applying geography. It brings together observational science and measurement and integrates it with modeling and prediction, analysis, and interpretation so that we can understand things.": "Jack",
  "As in biomedical science, pioneering industrial inventions have not been mothered by necessity. Rather, inventions for which there was no commercial use only later became the commercial airplanes, xerography and lasers on which modern society depends.": "Arthur",
  "I don't really know what the future of science is. Maybe we have come to the end of science; maybe science is a finite field. The inventions resulting from this finite field, however, are boundless.": "Ivar",
  "I wasn't a major in political science for nothing, so I understood the politics of beauty and the politics of race when it comes to the fashion industry.": "Iman",
  "It is a profound and necessary truth that the deep things in science are not found because they are useful: they are found because it was possible to find them.": "J.",
  "Aviation, this young modern giant, exemplifies the possible relationship of women and the creations of science. Although women have not taken full advantage of its use and benefits, air travel is as available to them as to men.": "Amelia",
  "The mineral world is a much more supple and mobile world than could be imagined by the science of the ancients. Vaguely analogous to the metamorphoses of living creatures, there occurs in the most solid rocks, as we now know, perpetual transformation of a mineral species.": "Pierre",
  "I stress the relevance of my work for cancer research because I believe that science must be useful to man.": "Renato",
  "The single life is bearable to me only through my work in science, but for the long term, it would be very bad if I had to make do without a very young person next to me.": "Werner",
  "I believe that the future of humanity is in the progress of reason through science. I believe that the pursuit of truth, through science, is the divine ideal which man should propose to himself.": "Emile",
  "There is nothing wrong with good accounting, except that it does not necessarily lead to good science.": "Gerhard",
  "Fine arts education in public schools is really abysmal. The same emphasis should be put on music, theater, dance - anything creative - that's put on math and science.": "Maren",
  "It's true in everything, not just in drag: To be a success, you have to understand the landscape. You have to know thyself, and you have to know your history so that you can draw from people who have figured out the equation you are faced with. It's not rocket science.": "RuPaul",
  "We must teach science in the mother tongue. Otherwise, science will become a highbrow activity. It will not be an activity in which all people can participate.": "C.",
  "The big lesson of planetary science is when you do a first reconnaissance of a new kind of object, you should expect the unexpected.": "Alan",
  "Science knows no country, because knowledge belongs to humanity, and is the torch which illuminates the world. Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence.": "Louis",
  "The birth of science as we know it arguably began with Isaac Newton's formulation of the laws of gravitation and motion. It is no exaggeration to say that physics was reborn in the early 20th-century with the twin revolutions of quantum mechanics and the theory of relativity.": "Paul",
  "GIS is waking up the world to the power of geography, this science of integration, and has the framework for creating a better future.": "Jack",
  "To me there has never been a higher source of earthly honor or distinction than that connected with advances in science.": "Isaac",
  "How is it that, in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence, there are still some who would deny the dangers of climate change? Not surprisingly, the loudest voices are not scientific, and it is remarkable how many economists, lawyers, journalists and politicians set themselves up as experts on the science.": "Nicholas",
  "It will free man from the remaining chains, the chains of gravity which still tie him to this planet.": "Wernher",
  "The origin of life is one of the great outstanding mysteries of science.": "Paul",
  "Climate change is real. Climate change is being substantially increased by humans and the carbon we put into the atmosphere. And it appears to be speeding up. If science has made any mistakes, science has been underestimating it.": "James",
  "I actually started off majoring in computer science, but I knew right away I wasn't going to stay with it. It was because I had this one professor who was the loneliest, saddest man I've ever known. He was a programmer, and I knew that I didn't want to do whatever he did. So after that, I switched to Communications.": "J.",
  "Ever since the Industrial Revolution, investments in science and technology have proved to be reliable engines of economic growth. If homegrown interest in those fields is not regenerated soon, the comfortable lifestyle to which Americans have become accustomed will draw to a rapid close.": "Neil",
  "Science can lift people out of poverty and cure disease. That, in turn, will reduce civil unrest.": "Stephen",
  "It is my belief that no matter how advanced man may become in science, technology, systems, and knowledge, he can never improve on the foundational precepts of marriage as the bedrock of social development.": "Myles",
  "Mass application of technological innovations, which constitutes much of the distinctive substance of modern economic growth, is closely connected with the further progress of science, in its turn the basis for additional advance in technology.": "Simon",
  "We must not be afraid to push boundaries; instead, we should leverage our science and our technology, together with our creativity and our curiosity, to solve the world's problems.": "Jason",
  "Modern bodybuilding is ritual, religion, sport, art, and science, awash in Western chemistry and mathematics. Defying nature, it surpasses it.": "Camille",
  "We look at science as something very elite, which only a few people can learn. That's just not true. You just have to start early and give kids a foundation. Kids live up, or down, to expectations.": "Mae",
  "If even in science there is no a way of judging a theory but by assessing the number, faith and vocal energy of its supporters, then this must be even more so in the social sciences: truth lies in power.": "Imre",
  "Genome design is going to be a key part of the future. That's why we need fast, cheap, accurate DNA synthesis, so you can make a lot of iterations of something and test them.": "Craig",
  "We will explore the mysteries of science and harness the power of technology and innovation. We will realise the opportunities of the digital world. Our youth will learn more from - and with - each other.": "Narendra",
  "For whatever reason, I didn't succumb to the stereotype that science wasn't for girls. I got encouragement from my parents. I never ran into a teacher or a counselor who told me that science was for boys. A lot of my friends did.": "Sally",
  "Global Warming: It is a hoax. It is bad science. It is high-jacking public policy. It is the greatest scam in history.": "John",
  "Looking ahead, I believe that the underlying importance of higher education, of science, of technology, of research and scholarship to our quality of life, to the strength of our economy, to our security in many dimensions will continue to be the most important message.": "Charles",
  "Science moves with the spirit of an adventure characterized both by youthful arrogance and by the belief that the truth, once found, would be simple as well as pretty.": "James",
  "Scientific knowledge is a kind of discourse.": "Jean-Francois",
  "Everything great in science and art is simple. What can be less complicated than the greatest discoveries of humanity - gravitation, the compass, the printing press, the steam engine, the electric telegraph?": "Jules",
  "To understand a science, it is necessary to know its history.": "Auguste",
  "When I was in elementary school, I was very interested in science already. I must have been ten or eleven years old. I started experiments with chemistry sets at my home in Mexico. I was able to borrow a bathroom and convert it to a laboratory. My parents supported it. They were pleased. My friends just tolerated it.": "Mario",
  "In science one tries to tell people, in such a way as to be understood by everyone, something that no one ever knew before. But in poetry, it's the exact opposite.": "Paul",
  "In science, if you don't do it, somebody else will. Whereas in art, if Beethoven didn't compose the 'Ninth Symphony,' no one else before or after is going to compose the 'Ninth Symphony' that he composed; no one else is going to paint 'Starry Night' by van Gogh.": "Neil",
  "Economics is not an exact science. It's a combination of an art and elements of science. And that's almost the first and last lesson to be learned about economics: that in my judgment, we are not converging toward exactitude, but we're improving our data bases and our ways of reasoning about them.": "Paul",
  "Science is built up of facts, as a house is with stones. But a collection of facts is no more a science than a heap of stones is a house.": "Henri",
  "The strongest arguments prove nothing so long as the conclusions are not verified by experience. Experimental science is the queen of sciences and the goal of all speculation.": "Roger",
  "Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next 10.": "Neil",
  "The human brain is an incredible pattern-matching machine.": "Jeff",
  "Individual science fiction stories may seem as trivial as ever to the blinder critics and philosophers of today - but the core of science fiction, its essence has become crucial to our salvation if we are to be saved at all.": "Isaac",
  "We are in a tech-heavy society, plunging headlong into an unknown future. Science fiction is what allows you to stand back and analyze the impact of that and put it in context of how it affects people.": "J.",
  "What's interesting about science is that we're constantly discovering new things about the universe, about ourselves, about our bodies, about diseases, about the possibilities of the future. It's amazing. Science is one of the coolest things about being a human being - without a doubt.": "Joe",
  "When science, art, literature, and philosophy are simply the manifestation of personality they are on a level where glorious and dazzling achievements are possible, which can make a man's name live for thousands of years.": "Denis",
  "While that amendment failed, human cloning continues to advance and the breakthrough in this unethical and morally questionable science is around the corner.": "Mike",
  "Psychology is the science of the intellects, characters and behavior of animals including man.": "Edward",
  "The enchanting charms of this sublime science reveal only to those who have the courage to go deeply into it.": "Carl",
  "He who possesses art and science has religion; he who does not possess them, needs religion.": "Johann",
  "Science is global. Einstein's equation, E=mc2, has to reach everywhere. Science is a beautiful gift to humanity, we should not distort it. Science does not differentiate between multiple races.": "A.",
  "Science is, rightly, searching for drugs to arrest ageing or to slow the advance of dementia. But the evidence suggests that many of the most powerful factors determining how you age come from what you do, and what you do with others: whether you work, whether you play music, whether you have regular visitors.": "Geoff",
  "It's a combination of science, maintenance, and general housekeeping. And then, occasionally, robotics activities or a spacewalk you might get to do.": "Scott",
  "Science is not everything, but science is very beautiful.": "J.",
  "I wanted to make an explicitly educational comic that taught readers the concepts I covered in my introductory programming class. That's what 'Secret Coders' is. It's both a fun story about a group of tweens who discover a secret coding school, and an explanation of some foundational ideas in computer science.": "Gene",
  "Poets say science takes away from the beauty of the stars - mere globs of gas atoms. I, too, can see the stars on a desert night, and feel them. But do I see less or more?": "Richard",
  "Wisdom alone is the science of other sciences.": "Plato",
  "Before I became a film major, I was very heavily into social science, I had done a lot of sociology, anthropology, and I was playing in what I call social psychology, which is sort of an offshoot of anthropology/sociology - looking at a culture as a living organism, why it does what it does.": "George",
  "I'm often asked by parents what advice can I give them to help get kids interested in science? And I have only one bit of advice. Get out of their way. Kids are born curious. Period.": "Neil",
  "That's one of those things about being a computer science major: Valentine's Day is just another day.": "Jawed",
  "When I die, I'm leaving my body to science fiction.": "Steven",
  "Every science consists in the coordination of facts; if the different observations were entirely isolated, there would be no science.": "Auguste",
  "The folly of mistaking a paradox for a discovery, a metaphor for a proof, a torrent of verbiage for a spring of capital truths, and oneself for an oracle, is inborn in us.": "Paul",
  "It's very important to reveal the mystery of the pyramid. Science in archaeology is very important. People all over the world are waiting to solve this mystery.": "Zahi",
  "The indigenous peoples never had, and still do not have, the place that they should have occupied in the progress and benefits of science and technology, although they represented an important basis for this development.": "Rigoberta",
  "A fact is a simple statement that everyone believes. It is innocent, unless found guilty. A hypothesis is a novel suggestion that no one wants to believe. It is guilty, until found effective.": "Edward",
  "Take young researchers, put them together in virtual seclusion, give them an unprecedented degree of freedom and turn up the pressure by fostering competitiveness.": "James",
  "What is research but a blind date with knowledge?": "Will",
  "I don't want to give advice to people about their religious beliefs, but I do think that it's not smart to bet against the power of science to figure out the natural world. It used to be, a thousand years ago, that if you wanted to explain why the moon moved through the sky, you needed to invoke God.": "Sean",
  "Nothing retains less of desire in art, in science, than this will to industry, booty, possession.": "Andre",
  "Science has revealed that the human body is made up of millions and millions of atoms... For example, I am made up of 5.8x10 27 atoms.": "A.",
  "What are the symbols of American strength, wealth, power and modernity? Certainly not jazz and rock and roll, not chewing-gum or hamburgers, Broadway or Hollywood. It's their skyscrapers. Their Pentagon. Their science. Their technology.": "Oriana",
  "None of the standard high school science courses made much of an impression on me, but I did enjoy the Advanced Placement Chemistry course I took in my senior year. This course had only eleven students and was taught by a rarity for our school, an exchange teacher from England, Mr. Leslie Sturges.": "Martin",
  "If history and science have taught us anything, it is that passion and desire are not the same as truth.": "E.",
  "Science cannot tell theology how to construct a doctrine of creation, but you can't construct a doctrine of creation without taking account of the age of the universe and the evolutionary character of cosmic history.": "John",
  "Science means simply the aggregate of all the recipes that are always successful. All the rest is literature.": "Paul",
  "We have failed to protect science against speculative extensions of nature, continuing to assign physical and mathematical properties to hypothetical entities beyond what is observable in nature.": "Robert",
  "'Star Wars' is more fairy tale than true science fiction.": "Mark",
  "I love science. I hate supposition, superstition, exaggeration and falsified data. Show me the research, show me the results, show me the conclusions - and then show me some qualified peer reviews of all that.": "Claire",
  "Unforeseen surprises are the rule in science, not the exception. Remember: Stuff happens.": "Leonard",
  "Science has always been my preoccupation and when you think a breakthrough is possible, it is terribly exciting.": "James",
  "Indeed, we often mark our progress in science by improvements in imaging.": "Martin",
  "Go beyond science, into the region of metaphysics. Real religion is beyond argument. It can only be lived both inwardly and outwardly.": "Swami",
  "I don't think there's an interesting boundary between philosophy and science. Science is totally beholden to philosophy. There are philosophical assumptions in science and there's no way to get around that.": "Sam",
  "We need to manage holistically, embracing all of our science and traditional knowledge - all sources of knowledge. We can do that from the household to government to international relations.": "Allan",
  "Game theory is a branch of, originally, applied mathematics, used mostly in economics and political science, a little bit in biology, that gives us a mathematical taxonomy of social life, and it predicts what people are likely to do and believe others will do in cases where everyone's actions affect everyone else.": "Colin",
  "The strength of self-reliance and self-development is that of science and technology, and the shortcut to implementing the five-year strategy is to give importance and precedence to science and technology.": "Kim",
  "It is right that we be concerned with the scientific probity of metaphysics.": "Gabriel",
  "This world, after all our science and sciences, is still a miracle; wonderful, inscrutable, magical and more, to whosoever will think of it.": "Thomas",
  "Triumphant science and technology are only at the threshold of man's command over sources of energy so stupendous that, if used for military purposes, they can wipe out our entire civilization.": "Cordell",
  "Some day science may have the existence of mankind in power, and the human race can commit suicide by blowing up the world.": "Henry",
  "Science is the highest personification of the nation because that nation will remain the first which carries the furthest the works of thought and intelligence.": "Louis",
  "The only shibboleth the West has is science. It is the premise of modernity and it defines itself as a rationality capable of, indeed requiring separation from politics, religion and really, society. Modernisation is to work towards this.": "Bruno",
  "One of the greatest features of science is that it doesn't matter where you were born, and it doesn't matter what the belief systems of your parents might have been: If you perform the same experiment that someone else did, at a different time and place, you'll get the same result.": "Neil",
  "I would not hesitate to say I was addicted to the Internet in the first two years. It can be addictive, and things not taken in moderation have negative effects. But the alarmism around 'Facebook is changing our brains' strikes me as a kind of historical trick. Because we now know from brain science that everything changes our brains.": "Clay",
  "Part of what it is to be scientifically-literate, it's not simply, 'Do you know what DNA is? Or what the Big Bang is?' That's an aspect of science literacy. The biggest part of it is do you know how to think about information that's presented in front of you.": "Neil",
  "Investing in science education and curiosity-driven research is investing in the future.": "Ahmed",
  "The soft power of science has the potential to reshape global diplomacy.": "Ahmed",
  "A regular old drag queen is usually your science teacher who's actually wearing women's panties underneath his slacks. A drag-queen superstar is someone who actually works in clubs and makes a living doing it more than one night a year, or even one night in six months.": "RuPaul",
  "We've arranged a civilization in which most crucial elements profoundly depend on science and technology.": "Carl",
  "Both the man of science and the man of action live always at the edge of mystery, surrounded by it.": "J.",
  "Science has sometimes been said to be opposed to faith, and inconsistent with it. But all science, in fact, rests on a basis of faith, for it assumes the permanence and uniformity of natural laws - a thing which can never be demonstrated.": "Tryon",
  "Theology is a science of mind applied to God.": "Henry",
  "One science only will one genius fit; so vast is art, so narrow human wit.": "Alexander",
  "I love having my hands in the dirt. It is never a science and always an art. There are no rules. And if it comes down to me versus that weed I'm trying to pull out of the ground that doesn't want to come out? I know I'll win.": "Matthew",
  "Modern science is fast-moving, and no laboratory can exist for long with a program based on old facilities. Innovation and renewal are required to keep a laboratory on the frontiers of science.": "Burton",
  "The recognition of the art that informs all pure science need not mean the abandonment for it of all present art, rather it will mean the completion of the transformation of art that has already begun.": "John",
  "Science gives us a powerful vocabulary, and it is impossible to produce a vocabulary with which one can only say nice things.": "John",
  "Math is sometimes called the science of patterns.": "Ronald",
  "One hardly knows where, in the history of science, to look for an important movement that had its effective start in so pure and simple an accident as that which led to the building of the great Washington telescope, and went on to the discovery of the satellites of Mars.": "Simon",
  "If Christianity is not scientific, and Science is not of God, then there is no invariable law, and truth becomes an accident.": "Mary",
  "Observation is a passive science, experimentation an active science.": "Claude",
  "Science commits suicide when it adopts a creed.": "Thomas",
  "Natural science will in time incorporate into itself the science of man, just as the science of man will incorporate into itself natural science: there will be one science.": "Karl",
  "The capacity of the female mind for studies of the highest order cannot be doubted, having been sufficiently illustrated by its works of genius, of erudition, and of science.": "James",
  "Human relations are built on feeling, not on reason or knowledge. And feeling is not an exact science; like all spiritual qualities, it has the vagueness of greatness about it.": "Amelia",
  "A science is something which is constructed from truth on workable axioms. There are 55 axioms in scientology which are very demonstrably true, and on these can be constructed a great deal.": "L.",
  "Of all the failed technologies that litter the onward march of science - steam carriages, zeppelins, armoured trains - none has been so catastrophic to prosperity as the last century's attempt to generate electricity from nuclear fission.": "James",
  "What I do is not rocket science, but I sure do love it.": "Kyle",
  "Science at its best is an open-minded method of inquiry, not a belief system.": "Rupert",
  "If you live in a ghetto and really want not to just change your life and your family's life but change your ghetto's life, make your ghetto a good neighbourhood, learn science; try to be like Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates and Steve Jobs.": "will.i.am",
  "Civilization depends on our expanding ability to produce food efficiently, which has markedly accelerated thanks to science and technology.": "Nina",
  "Science fiction without the science just becomes, you know, sword and sorcery, basically stories about heroism and not much more.": "Michio",
  "It's not a science when you are judging art, but we'd be remiss to say you can't look at something and say, 'This is more well done than that.'": "Matthew",
  "The roles of art, morality, religion, political faith, science itself are not to repair organic exhaustion nor to provide sound functioning of the organs. All this supraphysical life is built and expanded not because of the demands of the cosmic environment but because of the demands of the social environment.": "Emile",
  "I believe that science is the engine of prosperity, that if you look around at the wealth of civilization today, it's the wealth that comes from science.": "Michio",
  "Running for office was definitely something I've thought about. When I was younger, I wanted to major in political science. And I've been engaged in current events since I was a kid. If I can make a difference and feel passionately and capable, then I would. Why not?": "Queen",
  "Textbook science is beautiful! Textbook science is comprehensible, unlike mere fascinating words that can never be truly beautiful. Elementary science textbooks describe simple theories, and simplicity is the core of scientific beauty. Fascinating words have no power, nor yet any meaning, without the math.": "Eliezer",
  "One of the strangest features of string theory is that it requires more than the three spatial dimensions that we see directly in the world around us. That sounds like science fiction, but it is an indisputable outcome of the mathematics of string theory.": "Brian",
  "Creativity is essential to particle physics, cosmology, and to mathematics, and to other fields of science, just as it is to its more widely acknowledged beneficiaries - the arts and humanities.": "Lisa",
  "We know that to compete for the jobs of the 21st century and thrive in a global economy, we need a growing, skilled and educated workforce, particularly in the areas of science, technology, engineering and math. Americans with bachelor's degrees have half the unemployment rate of those with a high school degree.": "Mark",
  "The very large brain that humans have, plus the things that go along with it - language, art, science - seemed to have evolved only once. The eye, by contrast, independently evolved 40 times. So, if you were to 'replay' evolution, the eye would almost certainly appear again, whereas the big brain probably wouldn't.": "Richard",
  "How any government could promote the Vardy academies in the North-East of England is absolutely beyond me. Tony Blair defends them on grounds of diversity, but it should be unthinkable in the 21st century to have a school whose head of science believes the world is less than 10,000 years old.": "Richard",
  "Science is increasingly answering questions that used to be the province of religion.": "Stephen",
  "Before we understand science, it is natural to believe that God created the universe.": "Stephen",
  "Human resources are just tremendous in Egypt, but we need the science base; we need the correct science base.": "Ahmed",
  "The most obvious characteristic of science is its application: the fact that, as a consequence of science, one has a power to do things. And the effect this power has had need hardly be mentioned. The whole industrial revolution would almost have been impossible without the development of science.": "Richard",
  "The first education to be a good chemist is to do well in high school science courses. Then, you go to college to really become a chemist. You want to take science and math. Those are the main things.": "Mario",
  "As our technology evolves, we will have the capacity to reach new, ever-increasing depths. The question is what kind of technology, in the end, do we want to deploy in the far reaches of the ocean? Tools of science, ecology and documentation, or the destructive tools of heavy industry?": "Philippe",
  "Chemical synthesis is uniquely positioned at the heart of chemistry, the central science, and its impact on our lives and society is all pervasive.": "Elias",
  "I studied computer science and graphic design, yeah, so music was self-taught and a backburner thing, an obsessive hobby.": "Tycho",
  "The essence of science is independent thinking, hard work, and not equipment. When I got my Nobel Prize, I had spent hardly 200 rupees on my equipment.": "C.",
  "There has no doubt to be fundamental research in science, but applied research is equally important for new improvements and changes in our techniques.": "Lal",
  "The problem is that once we focus on economic policy, much that is not science comes into play. Politics becomes involved, and political posturing is amply rewarded by public attention.": "Robert",
  "Society lives by faith, and develops by science.": "Henri",
  "He who would do good to another must do it in Minute Particulars: general Good is the plea of the scoundrel, hypocrite, and flatterer, for Art and Science cannot exist but in minutely organized Particulars.": "William",
  "I decry the current tendency to seek patents on algorithms. There are better ways to earn a living than to prevent other people from making use of one's contributions to computer science.": "Donald",
  "History is, in its essentials, the science of change. It knows and it teaches that it is impossible to find two events that are ever exactly alike, because the conditions from which they spring are never identical.": "Marc",
  "Even when I was studying mathematics, physics, and computer science, it always seemed that the problem of consciousness was about the most interesting problem out there for science to come to grips with.": "David",
  "The question that I started off with was, I thought, very simple. It was just 'Is there a massive black hole at the center of the Milky Way?' But one of the things I love about science is that you always end up with new questions.": "Andrea",
  "A report released by the Partnership for a New American Economy and the Partnership for New York City predicts that by 2018, there will be 800,000 science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) jobs in the United States that require a master's degree or higher - and only around 550,000 American-graduates with this training.": "Marvin",
  "He is so old that his blood type was discontinued.": "Bill",
  "You cannot feed the hungry on statistics.": "Heinrich",
  "Bush reiterated his stand to conservatives opposing his decision on stem cell research. He said today he believes life begins at conception and ends at execution.": "Jay",
  "The cloning of humans is on most of the lists of things to worry about from Science, along with behaviour control, genetic engineering, transplanted heads, computer poetry and the unrestrained growth of plastic flowers.": "Lewis",
  "In science, 'fact' can only mean 'confirmed to such a degree that it would be perverse to withhold provisional assent.' I suppose that apples might start to rise tomorrow, but the possibility does not merit equal time in physics classrooms.": "Stephen",
  "The great tragedy of science - the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact.": "Thomas",
  "When I find myself in the company of scientists, I feel like a shabby curate who has strayed by mistake into a room full of dukes.": "W.",
  "Art is I science is we. ": "Claude",
  "The characteristic of scientific progress is our knowing that we did not know.": "Gaston",
  "Science, like art, religion, commerce, warfare, and even sleep, is based on presuppositions.": "Gregory",
  "The credit which the apparent conformity with recognized scientific standards can gain for seemingly simple but false theories may, as the present instance shows, have grave consequences.": "Friedrich",
  "This means that to entrust to science - or to deliberate control according to scientific principles - more than scientific method can achieve may have deplorable effects.": "Friedrich",
  "That's what Hubble can do for us. It can tell us whether the universe is expanding forever or if one day it's going to come back together.": "Duane",
  "For an object under the eye will appear very different from the same object placed above it; in an inclosed space, very different from the same in an open space.": "Vitruvius",
  "We don't regard any scientific theory as the absolute truth.": "Kenneth",
  "Most people don't realize it, because they're invisible, but microbes make up about a half of the Earth's biomass, whereas all animals only make up about one one-thousandth of all the biomass.": "Craig",
  "Heisenberg, Max Plank and Einstein, they all agreed that science could not solve the mystery of the universe.": "Harry",
  "I had no talent for science. What was infinitely worse: all my fraternity brothers were engineers.": "Kurt",
  "If you look at the history of our country over the last 100 years, there have been periods where science and research have been celebrated. They were really kind of held up as heroes in society, which encouraged a generation of people to go into these fields.": "Mark",
  "Formerly, when religion was strong and science weak, men mistook magic for medicine; now, when science is strong and religion weak, men mistake medicine for magic.": "Thomas",
  "I have seen the science I worshiped, and the aircraft I loved, destroying the civilization I expected them to serve.": "Charles",
  "There is no way that writers can be tamed and rendered civilized or even cured. The only solution known to science is to provide the patient with an isolation room, where he can endure the acute stages in private and where food can be poked in to him with a stick.": "Robert",
  "I like to browse in occult bookshops if for no other reason than to refresh my commitment to science.": "Heinz",
  "The theory of relativity worked out by Mr. Einstein, which is in the domain of natural science, I believe can also be applied to the political field. Both democracy and human rights are relative concepts - and not absolute and general.": "Jiang",
  "Science is not about control. It is about cultivating a perpetual condition of wonder in the face of something that forever grows one step richer and subtler than our latest theory about it. It is about reverence, not mastery.": "Richard",
  "Most of the fundamental ideas of science are essentially simple, and may, as a rule, be expressed in a language comprehensible to everyone.": "Albert",
  "Science fiction writers, I am sorry to say, really do not know anything. We can't talk about science, because our knowledge of it is limited and unofficial, and usually our fiction is dreadful.": "Philip",
  "In science, the credit goes to the man who convinces the world, not to whom the idea first occurs.": "Francis",
  "Experimentation is an active science.": "Claude",
  "Before I was reading science fiction, I read Hemingway. Farewell to Arms was my first adult novel that said not everything ends well. It was one of those times where reading has meant a great deal to me, in terms of my development - an insight came from that book.": "Robert",
  "Conflict between science and religion a dangerous foe.": "Henry",
  "Thousands of years ago, humans domesticated every possible large wild mammal species fulfilling all those criteria and worth domesticating, with the result that there have been no valuable additions of domestic animals in recent times, despite the efforts of modern science.": "Jared",
  "The major obstacle to a religious renewal is the intellectual classes, who are highly influential and tend to view religion as primitive superstition. They believe that science has left atheism as the only respectable intellectual stance.": "Robert",
  "The commonality between science and art is in trying to see profoundly - to develop strategies of seeing and showing.": "Edward",
  "Agency by agency, we frequently have lost a bit of ground, at least to inflation-but had it not been for the efforts we've made to educate people about the importance of science, technology and advanced education, those predictions very well might have come true.": "Charles",
  "It is this conception of the unity of the human career which is perhaps the greatest achievement of historical study, since it gained a place analogous to that of natural science.": "James",
  "Even in our day, science suspects beyond the Polar seas, at the very circle of the Arctic Pole, the existence of a sea which never freezes and a continent which is ever green.": "Helena",
  "We know from science that nothing in the universe exists as an isolated or independent entity.": "Margaret",
  "We would be in a nasty position indeed if empirical science were the only kind of science possible.": "Edmund",
  "I became kind of a drop-out in science after I came back to America. I wanted to photograph.": "Imogen",
  "At a time when science plays such a powerful role in the life of society, when the destiny of the whole of mankind may hinge on the results of scientific research, it is incumbent on all scientists to be fully conscious of that role, and conduct themselves accordingly.": "Joseph",
  "I did not imagine that the second half of my life would be spent on efforts to avert a mortal danger to humanity created by science.": "Joseph",
  "Predicting has a spotty record in science fiction. I've had some failures. On the other hand, I also predicted the fall of the Berlin Wall and the rise of fundamentalist Islam... and I'm not happy to be right in all of those cases.": "David",
  "I'm crazy about Grant: his character, his nature, his science in fighting and everything else. But I don't like the idea that he never accepted the blame for anything, always found someone else to blame for any mistake that was ever made, including blaming Prentiss for Shiloh.": "Shelby",
  "Indeed science alone may perhaps be sterile when pursued without an understanding of the world in which scientific knowledge is created and in which the fruits of science are used.": "Polykarp",
  "I wanted to have a political career. I thought studying political science would be the best way to achieve it.": "Bianca",
  "Certainly, it may bring to light such a deeper knowledge of the structure of matter as to constitute a veritable discontinuity in the progress of science.": "Ernest",
  "Einstein was searching for String Theory. It not only reconciles General Relativity to Quantum Mechanics, but it reconciles Science and the Bible as well.": "Roy",
  "I think computer science, by and large, is still stuck in the Modern age.": "Larry",
  "I certainly saw science as a kind of calling, and one with as much legitimacy as a religious calling.": "Joshua",
  "I'd like to put in a vote for the intrinsic fascination of science.": "Joshua",
  "In consequence, science is more important than ever for industrial technology.": "Kenneth",
  "In science, all facts, no matter how trivial or banal, enjoy democratic equality.": "Mary",
  "In science the important thing is to modify and change one's ideas as science advances.": "Herbert",
  "After all, science is essentially international, and it is only through lack of the historical sense that national qualities have been attributed to it.": "Marie",
  "It's time to let science and medicine, not politics and rhetoric, lead us to good, sound policy.": "Eliot",
  "Science in the modern world has many uses; its chief use, however, is to provide long words to cover the errors of the rich.": "Gilbert",
  "Science is properly more scrupulous than dogma. Dogma gives a charter to mistake, but the very breath of science is a contest with mistake, and must keep the conscience alive.": "George",
  "The fundamental concept in social science is Power, in the same sense in which Energy is the fundamental concept in physics.": "Bertrand",
  "Philosophy of science without history of science is empty history of science without philosophy of science is blind. ": "Imre",
  "To pursue science is not to disparage the things of the spirit. In fact, to pursue science rightly is to furnish the framework on which the spirit may rise.": "Vannevar",
  "And as we continue to improve our understanding of the basic science on which applications increasingly depend, material benefits of this and other kinds are secured for the future.": "Henry",
  "I think mistakes are the essence of science and law. It's impossible to conceive of either scientific progress or legal progress without understanding the important role of being wrong and of mistakes.": "Alan",
  "Fracking is doable if there's full disclosure of all chemicals used. Secondly, science dictates the policy rather than politics. Third, there's collaboration between environmental groups and the natural gas industry.": "Bill",
  "Faulkner is a writer who has had much to do with my soul, but Hemingway is the one who had the most to do with my craft - not simply for his books, but for his astounding knowledge of the aspect of craftsmanship in the science of writing.": "Gabriel",
  "Since Hiroshima and the Holocaust, science no longer holds its pristine place as the highest moral authority. Instead, that role is taken by human rights. It follows that any assault on Jewish life - on Jews or Judaism or the Jewish state - must be cast in the language of human rights.": "Jonathan",
  "What underlies great science is what underlies great art, whether it is visual or written, and that is the ability to distinguish patterns out of chaos.": "Diana",
  "I'm from the Madeleine L'Engle school. The more she delves into science, the more she knows there's a creator who's behind these amazing laws, these amazing events. The symmetry of nature, the structure and order of it.": "Tom",
  "If you look at the purported dangers of salt or fat, there is no consensus of support in scientific literature. So I would ask first: 'Is it possible to have an informed government that actually follows the science?' From what I've seen, it's not likely.": "Tim",
  "I went through the standard scientific atheist phase when I was about 14. I bought into that package deal of science equals atheism.": "Rupert",
  "Though we do need more women to graduate with technical degrees, I always like to remind women that you don't need to have science or technology degrees to build a career in tech.": "Susan",
  "Design and technology should be the subject where mathematical brainboxes and science whizzkids turn their bright ideas into useful products.": "James",
  "Fiction, maybe art in general, is a tentative, uncertain enterprise; it's not science, it's an exploration, but you never find much in the way of answers.": "Tim",
  "Science does not limit itself merely to what is currently verifiable. But it is interested in questions that are potentially verifiable (or, rather, falsifiable).": "Sam",
  "Science fiction isn't just thinking about the world out there. It's also thinking about how that world might be - a particularly important exercise for those who are oppressed, because if they're going to change the world we live in, they - and all of us - have to be able to think about a world that works differently.": "Samuel",
  "I think we're all fascinated and a little mystified by how the brain works. One of the most mysterious of the physical sciences is neurological science.": "Alexis",
  "Science is the pursuit of pure truth, and the systematizing of it.": "P.",
  "I really believe in science. It is a faith. It is a reverence akin to religion. But as we always say, it's different from religion in that, as near as we can tell, it exists outside of us. It has an objective quality, the process of science.": "Bill",
  "You don't need a science degree to understand about science. You just need to think about it.": "Bill",
  "Why is computer science a good field for women? For one thing, that's where the jobs are, and for another, the pay is better than for many jobs, and finally, it's easier to combine career and family.": "Madeleine",
  "When I was about 9 years old, I became very interested in the human body and diseases. In general, I was just curious about the world around me. I think that any sort of curiosity as a child is a good beginning to a career in science because science, at least to me, is a continuous exploration of the unknown.": "Eva",
  "I'm enormously interested to see where neuroscience can take us in understanding these complexities of the human brain and how it works, but I do think there may be limits in terms of what science can tell us about what does good and evil mean anyway, and what are those concepts about?": "Francis",
  "I think science is a foreign land for many people, so I think of my role as an ambassador's job.": "Marcus",
  "There is a science to managing high tech businesses, and it needs to be respected. One of them is that in technology businesses, leadership is temporary. It's constantly recycling. So the asset has limited lifetime.": "Eric",
  "Many schools today are sacrificing social studies, the arts and physical education so children can cover basic subjects like math, English and science.": "Geoffrey",
  "If you want to go beyond that small percentage of people who are already environmentally and scientifically aware, you have to make your work somehow link with a passion, interest, or profession of someone who isn't interested in science or nature.": "Nalini",
  "Man, in the collective sense, is the hero of science. Man, in the collective sense, is the hero of Earth.": "Jacque",
  "I'm not of a science background, I was never a comic book geek, and I was never a gamer.": "Niall",
  "Please don't make the mistake of thinking that 'Oryx and Crake' is anti-science. Science is a way of knowing, and a tool. Like all ways of knowing and tools, it can be turned to bad uses. And it can be bought and sold, and it often is. But it is not in itself bad. Like electricity, it's neutral.": "Margaret",
  "Yes - 90% of fantasy is crap. And so is 90% of science fiction and 90% of mystery fiction and 90% of literary fiction.": "George",
  "Music is an art that goes well beyond science. Proof can be found in the huge amount of studies that have been carried out throughout the world based on music-therapy and the important results achieved.": "Andrea",
  "My science teachers always encouraged their classes to 'go out and discover something' because all scientific endeavors depend on observation and experimentation. Through such pursuits, anyone can find something new to science, and if it's truly novel, the entire edifice of science might have to be restructured.": "Greg",
  "I think I regard any history in quotes, because just like science, we're constantly revising science, we're constantly revising history. There's no question that various victors throughout history have flat out lied about certain events or written themselves into things, and then you come along and you find out that this disproves that.": "David",
  "Sometimes people talk about conflict between humans and machines, and you can see that in a lot of science fiction. But the machines we're creating are not some invasion from Mars. We create these tools to expand our own reach.": "Ray",
  "Science and mindfulness complement each other in helping people to eat well and maintain their health and well-being.": "Nhat",
  "Science operates in the natural, not the supernatural. In fact, I go so far as to state that there is no such thing as the supernatural or the paranormal.": "Michael",
  "If you go into science, I think you better go in with a dream that maybe you, too, will get a Nobel Prize. It's not that I went in and I thought I was very bright and I was going to get one, but I'll confess, you know, I knew what it was.": "James",
  "My whole life has been basically trying to find intelligent students or, you know, highly motivated students and giving them an opportunity to do good science.": "James",
  "We need to be more conversant with it because science is in our lives. It's in everything. It's in the food we eat. It's in the air we breathe. It's everywhere.": "Alan",
  "I love technology, and I love science. It's just always all in the way you use it. So there's no - you can't really blame anything on the technology. It's just the way people use it, and it always has been.": "Steve",
  "I think that prog rock is the science fiction of music. Science fiction speculates on what the future might be and look like and how we'll get there, and yet there's always a central theme of humanity, or there should be. Progressive rock has the same concept of exploration into the parts of the music world that hasn't been explored.": "William",
  "My father was a professor of political science and also a young politician fighting for democracy in Kenya, and when things got ugly, he went into political exile in Mexico.": "Lupita",
  "I just am a huge cheerleader for getting kids interested in science and technology.": "Vint",
  "Religion can have psychological and social roles, but in terms of really explaining how things work, science works differently. Science is based on material elements at the core.": "Lisa",
  "It's sort of nice in more general terms to see that computational science, computational biology is being recognized. It's become a very large field, and it's always in some ways been the poor sister, or the ugly sister, to experimental biology.": "Michael",
  "You can't train kids in a world where adults have no concept of what science literacy is. The adults are gonna squash the creativity that would manifest itself, because they're clueless about what it and why it matters. But science can always benefit from the more brains there are that are thinking about it - but that's true for any field.": "Neil",
  "While I'm a big fan of science fiction, especially as rendered in expensive Hollywood blockbusters, it's the real universe that calls to me.": "Neil",
  "Let's say intelligence is your ability to compose poetry, symphonies, do art, math and science. Chimps can't do any of that, yet we share 99 percent DNA. Everything that we are, that distinguishes us from chimps, emerges from that one-percent difference.": "Neil",
  "We're at peak oil, peak water, peak resources, and so either we figure it out and let science lead or we head down a very bad, dark trail to where a lot of people aren't going to make it.": "Henry",
  "To mistrust science and deny the validity of scientific method is to resign your job as a human. You'd better go look for work as a plant or wild animal.": "P.",
  "Science is a little bit more than a wonderful way of modelling and predicting it's a wonderful technical abstraction. I think science is a really wonderful technical abstraction. ": "Bernard",
  "I'm fond of science fiction. But not all science fiction. I like science fiction where there's a scientific lesson, for example - when the science fiction book changes one thing but leaves the rest of science intact and explores the consequences of that. That's actually very valuable.": "Richard",
  "I have found far greater enthusiasm for science in America than here in Britain. There is more enthusiasm for everything in America.": "Stephen",
  "All the leadership positions that I have had have one common denominator: none has required that I give up my science work.": "Mildred",
  "Networked science has the potential to speed up dramatically the rate of discovery across all of science.": "Michael",
  "In art, as in science, reductionism does not trivialize our perception - of color, light, and perspective - but allows us to see each of these components in a new way.": "Eric",
  "If you were a kid in 1955, you would pick up a copy of 'Popular Science' and it would say, 'This is the kind of car you're going to be driving in five years or in 20 years you'll be able to take a jet plane from New York to London in four hours,' or something like that. We actually got used to the idea that the future's going to be different.": "David",
  "I never took a computer science course in college, because then it was a thing you just learned on your own.": "Mitchel",
  "The scientists who attack mainstream religion, rather than striving for peaceful coexistence with it, damage science, and also weaken the fight against fundamentalism.": "Martin",
  "Basic science provides long-term benefits for ourselves and our fragile planet and should be supported by all the world's societies.": "David",
  "When you're doing a film called 'Interstellar,' at some point - the idea was to be grounded in the science as much as possible - but with a name like 'Interstellar,' you had better go somewhere big and bold.": "Jonathan",
  "There's a magical energy and power from the ocean. I was born in a room overlooking the sea, in the middle of a storm. Perhaps, then, it's not surprising that shores touch my soul. Science might disagree, but I think there's a difference in the air on a coast - the positive ions, perhaps.": "Jo",
  "I want to make a drug. I want the science to be more than imaginary, where I think, 'We're learning these fundamental principles, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.' I think we are doing that, but I want to do something really practical. I want to actually, in my lifetime, help people.": "Bonnie",
  "Before I lost my voice, it was slurred, so only those close to me could understand, but with the computer voice, I found I could give popular lectures. I enjoy communicating science. It is important that the public understands basic science, if they are not to leave vital decisions to others.": "Stephen",
  "I've always resented the force of attraction that traps me here on Planet Earth. It makes me feel like a bug stuck to a piece of duct tape. Ever since my teenage years, when I used to read a lot of science fiction and took it much too seriously, I've dreamed of somehow reaching escape velocity. I am, you might say, anti-gravity.": "Charles",
  "Science is the quintessential international endeavour, and the sterling reputation of the Nobel awards is partly due to the widely-perceived lack of national and other biases in the selection of the laureates.": "John",
  "The U.S. can still maintain research institutions, such as Caltech, that are the envy of the world, yet it would be hubristic and naive to think that this position is sustainable without investing in science education and basic research.": "Ahmed",
  "One of the reasons I like working with schools is to try to convince women that they can be scientists and that science can be fun.": "Nancy",
  "Moonshots live in that place between audacious projects and pure science fiction.": "Astro",
  "You look at science fiction and look how often it talks about being alien, being alienated about the other. Look at the number of blue people - 'Avatar,' I'm looking at you. And it is now easier to find people of color in science-fiction literature and media, but the issues of representation are still really, really troubling.": "Nalo",
  "I had no specific bent toward science until my grandfather died of cancer. I decided nobody should suffer that much.": "Gertrude",
  "My research career has been devoted to understanding human decision-making and problem-solving processes. The pursuit of this goal has led me into the fields of political science, economics, cognitive psychology, computer science and philosophy of science, among others.": "Herbert",
  "I had been interested in science from when I was very young, but after a disastrous summer lab experience in which every experiment I tried failed, I decided on graduating from college that I was not cut out to be a scientist.": "Martin",
  "Science and the many benefits that science has produced have played a crucial part in our history and produced vast improvements to human welfare.": "John",
  "People want to think of economics as a natural science, like physics, with the comforting reliability of simple-to-understand theories like F=MA. Unfortunately, it isn't. Economics is a social science, and the so-called theories are really social and moral constructs.": "Nick",
  "If anyone offers conjectures about the truth of things from the mere possibility of hypotheses, I do not see by what stipulation anything certain can be determined in any science, since one or another set of hypotheses may always be devised which will appear to supply new difficulties.": "Isaac",
  "As we talk with candour, we open the doors to new possibilities and new areas of cooperation in advance in democracy, in combating terrorism, in energy and environment, science and technology and international peacekeeping.": "Atal",
  "Science, literature, and common sense tell us that the self is a fickle thing, subject to revision in real time, and that the chasm that exists between any two people exists inside each and every one of us.": "Jesse",
  "I think a lot of people have an idea of virtual reality from science fiction, books and movies that have been out over the last couple of decades.": "Brendan",
  "From a purely positivist point of view, man is the most mysterious and disconcerting of all the objects met with by science.": "Pierre",
  "Most science fiction is based on our knowledge now and uses that to project the future.": "Judith",
  "My work is mostly about longing, human relationships, science and children - and a little bit about ghosts and reincarnation.": "Amy",
  "Science in textbooks is not fun. But if you start doing science yourself, you will find delight.": "Masatoshi",
  "As for my studies in school, I was a solid student. I was strong in English and Latin, but I got lost anytime the subject included math. I wish I had paid more attention to biology and science in general, subjects that came to interest me as an adult. I could have gotten better marks, but I never took a book home, never did homework.": "Dick",
  "Science and technology are the keys to both our longevity and our demise. Our entire existence on this planet is a double-edged sword.": "Rhys",
  "Surgical Anatomy is, to the student of medicine and surgery, the most essential branch of anatomical science, having reference more especially to an accurate knowledge of the more important regions, and consisting in the application of anatomy generally to the practice of surgery.": "Henry",
  "I always say to my students that being a scientist is like being an explorer, and I really mean that because, in a sense, I think in science we explore the world, the universe around us.": "Roderick",
  "Historically, science and society have gone separate ways, although society has provided the funds for science to grow, and in return, science has given society all the material things it enjoys.": "Renato",
  "Corporate America limits the world to consumerism. Science can limit it to the material world. Even religion limits it to a lot of theories that can explain everything. I think we need cinema to break that apart and remind us that we're not in control, and we don't understand as much as we think do.": "Scott",
  "Culture cannot be separated from politics. The arts, philosophy and metaphysics, religion and the sciences, constitute culture. Politics are the science or art of organizing our relationships to allow for the development of life in society.": "Eugene",
  "If spiritual science is to do the same for spirit that natural science has done for nature, it must investigate quite differently from the latter. It must find ways and means of penetrating into the sphere of the spiritual, a domain which cannot be perceived with outer physical senses nor apprehended with the intellect which is bound to the brain.": "Rudolf",
  "The history of our spiritual life is a continuing search for the unity between ourselves and the world. Religion, art, and science follow, one and all, this aim.": "Rudolf",
  "I was a Social Science major in college, with an emphasis in secondary education. I took as many courses on the American colonial era and westward expansion as I could. This turned out to be wonderful preparation for writing fantasy novels.": "Rae",
  "My friends have said, 'Wait, you're pretty, and you sing? What do you mean you're interested in science?' I have to just hold my head and go, 'Do you hear yourself?' By no means should you ever limit yourself because of what others think or because of their perceptions of what someone looks like in a certain field.": "Auli'i",
  "More and more jobs are applying cutting-edge technologies and now demand deeper knowledge of math and science in positions that most people don't think of as STEM-related, including machinists, electricians, auto techs, medical technicians, plumbers and pipefitters.": "Rex",
  "The art of entrepreneurship and the science of Customer Development is not just getting out of the building and listening to prospective customers. It's understanding who to listen to and why.": "Steve",
  "What I knew was I liked math and science, and I never wanted to memorize everything. I wanted to understand where it came from.": "Ginni",
  "I read science fiction every single day of my life. It's my primary love.": "Twinkle",
  "Something is wrong that we have to feed so many. Why should there be poverty with all of our science and technology? There is no deficit in human resources - it is a deficit in human will.": "Coretta",
  "We are really battling, today in the U.S., keeping science education in the forefront at the elementary level, and that's where the research shows that kids get interested.": "Steve",
  "I've finished 12th standard from Poddar International and enrolled for B.A. in political science in Cambridge University, London. It's a correspondence course, and I'll go to London for my exams once a year. That way, I can devote more time to films.": "Hansika",
  "Widening the talent pipeline sufficiently will require a generational commitment to teaching math and science, providing technical training, and mentoring young people of all backgrounds so they understand the full range of possibilities that a career in technology affords.": "John",
  "Biotech 1.0 is slow, like a lab science, and Version 2.0 is more like computational sciences.": "Steve",
  "No one has a monopoly on truth, and science continues to advance. Yesterday's heresies may be tomorrow's conventional wisdom.": "Dean",
  "Science fiction always has had strains of pessimism and optimism weaving through its historical development, sometimes one dominating and then the other, usually depending on the state of the world.": "James",
  "I don't join the New Atheists. So, for example, I wouldn't have the arrogance to lecture some mother who hopes to see her dying child in Heaven - that's none of my business, ultimately. I won't lecture her on the philosophy of science.": "Noam",
  "I've always been interested in science - one of my favourite books is James Watson's 'Molecular Biology of the Gene.'": "Bill",
  "I'm on a crusade to get movie directors to get their science right because, more often than they believe, the science is more extraordinary than anything they can invent.": "Neil",
  "Of course in science there are things that are open to doubt and things need to be discussed. But among the things that science does know, evolution is about as certain as anything we know.": "Richard",
  "To an honest judge, the alleged marriage between religion and science is a shallow, empty, spin-doctored sham.": "Richard",
  "If you believe in science, like I do, you believe that there are certain laws that are always obeyed.": "Stephen",
  "I believe there are no questions that science can't answer about a physical universe.": "Stephen",
  "The science is settled; it's not even a consensus, it is a unanimity that human life begins at conception.": "Marco",
  "Mars has been flown by, orbited, smacked into, radar inspected, and rocketed onto, as well as bounced upon, rolled over, shoveled, drilled into, baked, and even laser blasted.": "Buzz",
  "I love science fiction - always have.": "Simon",
  "Remember, science fiction's always been the kind of first level alert to think about things to come. It's easier for an audience to take warnings from sci-fi without feeling that we're preaching to them. Every science fiction movie I have ever seen, any one that's worth its weight in celluloid, warns us about things that ultimately come true.": "Steven",
  "Touch a scientist and you touch a child.": "Ray",
  "Everything you see is filtered through your visual system (imperfect) and your brain (also imperfect, despite what your mom told you). Witness testimony is the worst kind of evidence in science.": "Seth",
  "You may not see massive UFO exhibits at your local science museum, but there's no dearth of saucer stories infesting my email. Every day, I receive several reports of alien sightings, extraterrestrial plans for Earth, and agitated screeds about the reluctance of scientists to take the whole subject seriously.": "Seth",
  "Typically, only about 2 percent of the American populace tunes in to PBS's 'Nova' series - the most successful science show on the tube. 'Survivor' and 'X Factor' get twice the ratings.": "Seth",
  "Traditional science assumes, for the most part, that an objective observer independent reality exists; the universe, stars, galaxies, sun, moon and earth would still be there if no one was looking.": "Deepak",
  "There's something about studying body language and non-spoken emotion - I know the innate response. But to really study it like a science would be fun.": "Shia",
  "I couldn't have gotten sober without rehab because I needed the science.": "Rob",
  "The crossroads of science and politics is a dodgy place.": "Nancy",
  "Science, already oppressive with its shocking revelations, will perhaps be the ultimate exterminator of our human species - if separate species we be - for its reserve of unguessed horrors could never be borne by mortal brains if loosed upon the world.": "H.",
  "Science has explained nothing the more we know the more fantastic the world becomes and the profounder the surrounding darkness. ": "Aldous",
  "The selfsame procedure which zoology, a branch of the natural sciences, applies to the study of animals, anthropology must apply to the study of man; and by doing so, it enrolls itself as a science in the field of nature.": "Maria",
  "The ideas associated with the problems of the development of science, as far as I can see by looking around me, are not of the kind that everyone appreciates.": "Richard",
  "People challenge my nerd cred all the time. I just show them the photo of me winning my middle-school science fair, wearing my Casio calculator watch and eyeglasses so big they look like they can see the future.": "Aisha",
  "When a herd of cattle see a strange object, they are not satisfied till each one has sniffed it; and the horse is cured of his fright at the robe, or the meal-bag, or other object, as soon as he can be induced to smell it. There is a great deal of speculation in the eye of an animal, but very little science.": "John",
  "The Jetsons had them in the 1960s. They were the defining element of 'Knight Rider' in the 1980s: cars that drive themselves. Self-driving cars appear in countless science fiction movies. By Hollywood standards, they are so normal we don't even notice them. But in real life, they still don't exist. What if you could buy one today?": "Sebastian",
  "I believe in general in a dualism between facts and the ideas of those facts in human heads.": "George",
  "Theory helps us to bear our ignorance of facts.": "George",
  "Kim Il Sung University is the central base for training national cadres and the highest institute of Juche-based science and education.": "Kim",
  "Wandering around the web is like living in a world in which every doorway is actually one of those science fiction devices which deposit you in a completely different part of the world when you walk through them. In fact, it isn't like it, it is it.": "Douglas",
  "In my brief sojourn in college, my favorite classes were political science because I loved the idea of systems we can set up that benefit society - rules we can put in place that sometimes you run against, sometimes they're painful, but ultimately they benefit the world.": "Matt",
  "Political liberty, the peace of a nation, and science itself are gifts for which Fate demands a heavy tax in blood!": "Honore",
  "My parents wanted me to be a doctor. So I took up science, but then realised that my heart was not in it at all. The thought of treating ailing people was very depressing.": "Kangana",
  "It should be that every child, when they leave school, can do ten meals, because when they leave home, they've got to be able to eat healthily. Blow the science of it and everything else. They've just got to be able to know what's good for them, how to buy it, and how to make a few dishes that they enjoy and don't cost too much.": "Mary",
  "The nineteenth century believed in science but the twentieth century does not.": "Gertrude",
  "Science is a self-correcting discipline that can, in subsequent generations, show that previous ideas were not correct.": "Brian",
  "I like physics. I think it is the best science out of all three of them, because generally it's more useful. You learn about speed and velocity and time, and that's all clever stuff.": "Tom",
  "Politics I conceive to be nothing more than the science of the ordered progress of society along the lines of greatest usefulness and convenience to itself.": "Woodrow",
  "A river is a river, independent of whether there are other rivers nearby. In science, we call things what they are based on their attributes, not what they're next to.": "Alan",
  "I think people are realizing that engineering and science are extremely good degrees to get and you'll be very highly paid once you've got them.": "James",
  "Fiction is lies; we're writing about people who never existed and events that never happened when we write fiction, whether its science fiction or fantasy or western mystery stories or so-called literary stories. All those things are essentially untrue. But it has to have a truth at the core of it.": "George",
  "More and more NFL players have been willing their bodies to science so that their brains can be studied even if they die of other causes.": "Jeffrey",
  "Science has yet to isolate the Godiva Chocolate or Prada gene, but that doesn't mean your weakness for pricey swag isn't woven into your DNA. According to a new study of identical twins, it's less TV ads or Labor Day sales that make you buy the things you do than the tastes and temperaments that are already part of you at birth.": "Jeffrey",
  "I often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples' ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had. And I compare that to witchcraft and alchemy, where openness was something you didn't do.": "Linus",
  "I am fascinated by the engineering. The science of constructing and understanding why it stands. And I am drawn by the madness, the beauty, the theatricality, the poetry and soul of the wire. And you cannot be a wire-walker without mingling those two ways of seeing life.": "Philippe",
  "I am often amazed at how much more capability and enthusiasm for science there is among elementary school youngsters than among college students.": "Carl",
  "To me it's no accident that all the symphony orchestras around the world tune up to the note A. And A is 440 cycles, except in Germany where it's 444. But the universe is 450 cycles. So what I'm trying to say is, I think it's God's voice, melody especially. Counterpoint, retrograde inversion, harmony... that's the science and the craft.": "Quincy",
  "I hate facts. I always say the chief end of man is to form general propositions - adding that no general proposition is worth a damn.": "Oliver",
  "Women tend to be more intuitive, or to admit to being intuitive, and maybe the hard science approach isn't so attractive. The way that science is taught is very cold. I would never have become a scientist if I had been taught like that.": "Jane",
  "I've always been kind of a mutt creatively. I started off in journalism, and I've actually done more police and procedural shows than I've ever done science fiction shows. I was on 'Murder She Wrote,' I was on 'Walker, Texas Ranger,' I was on 'Jake and the Fat Man.'": "J.",
  "I think that's what distinguishes Schmidt, really. In the movies now, so much of what is appealing to an audience is the dramatic or has to do with science fiction, and Schmidt is simply human. There's no melodrama; there's no device, It's just about a human being.": "Jack",
  "Everything is becoming science fiction. From the margins of an almost invisible literature has sprung the intact reality of the 20th century.": "J.",
  "Modern political science started in the late nineteenth century as a branch of history.": "Jill",
  "I don't know if science and reason will ultimately help guide humanity to a better and more peaceful future, but I am certain that this belief is part of what keeps the 'Star Trek' fandom going.": "Lawrence",
  "When a person's religious beliefs cause him to deny the evidence of science, or for whom public policy morphs into a battle with the devil, shouldn't that be a subject for discussion and debate?": "Lawrence",
  "In adapting to life in the melting pot of America, I discovered that the same soft power of science has a huge influence in building bridges between cultures and religions - and has the potential to do so with the Muslim world.": "Ahmed",
  "We can celebrate how far we've come from our sexist past when women and men are equally represented in the pages of science fiction anthologies.": "Annalee",
  "Women are being welcomed into science fiction, but it's through the back door.": "Annalee",
  "Science is organized common sense where many a beautiful theory was killed by an ugly fact.": "Thomas",
  "Science reckons many prophets, but there is not even a promise of a Messiah.": "Thomas",
  "Genetic modification has many different areas, for example in medicine, and Britain is at the leading edge of this new technology. I don't know, but people tell me, it could indeed by the leading science of the 21st century. All I say to people is: 'Just keep an open mind and let us proceed according to genuine scientific evidence.'": "Tony",
  "We talk about the Internet. That comes from science. Weather forecasting. That comes from science. The main idea in all of biology is evolution. To not teach it to our young people is wrong.": "Bill",
  "I liked math - that was my favorite subject - and I was very interested in astronomy and in physical science.": "Sally",
  "Fashion is more about feel than science.": "Pharrell",
  "There is a major problem with reliance on placebos, like most vitamins and antioxidants. Everyone gets upset about Big Science, Big Pharma, but they love Big Placebo.": "Michael",
  "Science is the first expression of punk, because it doesn't advance without challenging authority. It doesn't make progress without tearing down what was there before and building upon the structure.": "Greg",
  "I definitely was attracted to similar things in punk and science. They both depend on a healthy dose of skepticism.": "Greg",
  "I'm saying that there were many great naturalists before Darwin's time who were very pious people and who knew more about nature than most of us. These were great naturalists people I would admire for their knowledge of natural science given the time. ": "Greg",
  "The capacity to be puzzled is the premise of all creation, be it in art or in science.": "Erich",
  "Inanimate objects can be classified scientifically into three major categories; those that don't work, those that break down and those that get lost.": "Russell",
  "I think science fiction helps us think about possibilities, to speculate - it helps us look at our society from a different perspective. It lets us look at our mores, using science as the backdrop, as the game changer.": "Mae",
  "The difference between science and the fuzzy subjects is that science requires reasoning while those other subjects merely require scholarship.": "Robert",
  "Rocket science has been mythologized all out of proportion to its true difficulty.": "John",
  "There is no complete theory of anything.": "Robert",
  "Science's domain is the natural. If you want to understand the natural world and be sure you're not misleading yourself, science is the way to do it.": "Francis",
  "When does life begin? When does the soul enter? That's a religious question. Science is not going to be able to help with that.": "Francis",
  "Science fiction has these obsessions with certain sciences - large scale engineering, neuroscience.": "Paolo",
  "As a child, I was fascinated by any branch of physical or biological science. Even today, I find great excitement in discovering the complexity and variability of the world we live in, getting a glimpse into the deeper reality that we mostly ignore in our everyday human activities.": "Robert",
  "I like to think of it as this new field. Instead of computer science, it's going to be virtual science.": "Brendan",
  "We seem to have a compulsion these days to bury time capsules in order to give those people living in the next century or so some idea of what we are like.": "Alfred",
  "All my mind was centered on my studies, which, especially at the beginning, were difficult. In fact, I was insufficiently prepared to follow the physical science course at the Sorbonne, for, despite all my efforts, I had not succeeded in acquiring in Poland a preparation as complete as that of the French students following the same course.": "Marie",
  "Scientists worldwide agree that the reduction needed to stabilize the climate is actually more like 80 percent.": "Donella",
  "Science is spectral analysis. Art is light synthesis.": "Karl",
  "Science is a wonderful discipline, to which we are deeply indebted.": "Ray",
  "Fudging the data in any way whatsoever is quite literally a sin against the holy ghost of science. I'm not religious, but I put it that way because I feel so strongly. It's the one thing you do not ever do. You've got to have standards.": "James",
  "Logic is neither an art nor a science but a dodge.": "Stendhal",
  "Modernism in Vienna brought together science and culture in a new way to create an Age of Insight that emphasized a more complex view of the human mind than had ever existed before.": "Eric",
  "Science is like a flashlight in the hands of people living in a huge balloon. They can illuminate anything in the balloon, but cannot shine it outside the balloon to see where it is floating - or if it is floating at all.": "Huston",
  "Tracing the beginnings of the interwoven stories of science can be arbitrary, as beginnings are so often lost in the mists of time.": "Elizabeth",
  "Luckily, unreasonable expectations go hand in hand with naive young scientists. The more naive the better - otherwise we would never have the audacity to try and build a 22,000-mile-high space elevator or some sprawling underwater hotel.": "Daniel",
  "The radical novelty of modern science lies precisely in the rejection of the belief... that the forces which move the stars and atoms are contingent upon the preferences of the human heart.": "Walter",
  "In history class, I wrote a poem, 'The Royalists and the Roundheads.' I would write poems about driftwood in art class and little stories about the sun, moon, and stars in science class. Since not many kids were writing in class, I got away with it.": "Judith",
  "I'd like to see people pay attention to the science of hip hop. The knowledge part, the political side of what hip hop could do, or where hip hop is gonna go. I always say it's gonna become universal as we become a galactic union.": "Afrika",
  "Grades can matter, especially for those students and parents who live for the next round of applications to graduate or professional schools. But there's a problem with the grade emphasis. Math or science graduates earn more than students majoring in the humanities.": "Amity",
  "Sense About Science is much more than an innocent fact-checking service. It is a spin-off of a bizarre political network that began life as the ultra-left Revolutionary Communist Party and switched over to extreme corporate libertarianism when it launched 'Living Marxism' magazine in the late eighties.": "Zac",
  "People go into science out of curiosity, not to win awards. But scientists are human and have ambitions.": "Venkatraman",
  "Governments and scientists in India need to ensure that politics and religious ideology do not intrude into science. They belong to separate spheres, and if they are not kept separate, it is science in India and the country as a whole that will suffer.": "Venkatraman",
  "I am still the same person doing the same science. Why are people so impressed when some academy in Sweden gives an award?": "Venkatraman",
  "People think of the inventor as a screwball, but no one ever asks the inventor what he thinks of other people.": "Charles",
  "Whatever science and philosophy may do for mankind, the world can never outgrow its need of the simplicity that is in Christ.": "Lucy",
  "It's man's nature to abuse knowledge and power, be it in the realm of science, government, or Wall Street. Take God out of the picture, and you have real trouble.": "Frank",
  "HGH testing is happening in Olympics. The science is there. It is a valid test.": "Roger",
  "Traditionally, scientists have treated the laws of physics as simply 'given,' elegant mathematical relationships that were somehow imprinted on the universe at its birth, and fixed thereafter. Inquiry into the origin and nature of the laws was not regarded as a proper part of science.": "Paul",
  "Beauty is the lowest common denominator: I don't care what they say - every girl, every woman, wants to feel pretty and empowered and beautiful, within their own definition of beautiful. I love fashion, I love shopping, but I love beauty more because I love the science of it.": "Eva",
  "I developed that for a long time. I also developed 'Sugar Sweet Science' at New Line and that didn't happen. That was a boxing movie. And between all that there were a couple of other things.": "Danny",
  "Every day, I read books on philosophy and science fiction and human consciousness.": "Tom",
  "Sometime in the future, science will be able to create realities that we can't even begin to imagine. As we evolve, we'll be able to construct other information systems that correspond to other realities, universes based on logic completely different from ours and not based on space and time.": "Robert",
  "Amazingly when you add life and consciousness to the equation you can actually explain some of the biggest puzzles of science.": "Robert",
  "My model for Kirk was Horatio Hornblower from the C.S. Forester sea stories. Shatner was open-minded about science fiction and a marvelous choice.": "Gene",
  "Few tragedies can be more extensive than the stunting of life, few injustices deeper than the denial of an opportunity to strive or even to hope, by a limit imposed from without, but falsely identified as lying within.": "Stephen",
  "Nothing in the universe can travel at the speed of light, they say, forgetful of the shadow's speed.": "Howard",
  "I always knew I wanted to be a technologist, so I went to Duke and got a degree in computer science and electrical engineering. Really, I thought my goal in life was to be an inventor, a problem solver, so I thought I needed a Ph.D. to be good at inventions, but it turns out that you don't.": "Aaron",
  "Let us advance science to create a better world for all.": "Dan",
  "Philosophy is altogether less pure now. It's been impurified by science and social science and history.": "Bernard",
  "The people I really do dislike are the morally unimaginative kind of evolutionary reductionists who, in the name of science, think they can explain everything in terms of our early hominid ancestors or our genes, with their combination of high-handed tone and disregard for history. Such reductive speculation encourages a really empty scientism.": "Bernard",
  "It seems true that the growth of science and secularism made organized Christianity feel under threat.": "Mary",
  "The accumulation of skill and science which has been directed to diminish the difficulty of producing manufactured goods, has not been beneficial to that country alone in which it is concentrated; distant kingdoms have participated in its advantages.": "Charles",
  "My point has always been that, ever since the Industrial Revolution, science fiction has been the most important genre there is.": "Iain",
  "Some dreamers demand that scientists only discover things that can be used for good.": "John",
  "For science must breathe the oxygen of freedom.": "John",
  "When I was a kid, I loved 'The Curse of Frankenstein,' 'The Creeping Unknown,' 'X: The Unknown.' I love 'Forbidden Planet,' 'The Thing from Another World.' They were science fiction/horror movies, generally.": "John",
  "Those who incline to very strictly utilitarian views may perhaps feel that the peculiar powers of the Analytical Engine bear upon questions of abstract and speculative science rather than upon those involving everyday and ordinary human interests.": "Ada",
  "I have had a small handful of truly blatantly discriminatory experiences for being transgender, but the vast majority are simply the differences between being a man versus being a woman in science and business.": "Vivienne",
  "However far modern science and techniques have fallen short of their inherent possibilities, they have taught mankind at least one lesson; nothing is impossible.": "Lewis",

  "'Star Trek' is the McDonald's of science fiction; it's fast food storytelling. Every problem is like every other problem. They all get solved in an hour. Nobody ever gets hurt, and nobody needs to care. You give up an hour of your time, and you don't really have to get involved. It's all plastic.": "David",
  "Science is about applying what we know and asking what we don't know.": "Tim",
  "I do not know what got me interested in technology. What was very clear to me very early on was that I was not interested in religion and that naturally increased my curiosity about science and technology, and I fundamentally believe the two are conflicting.": "Vinod",
  "I think there is a tendency in science to measure what is measurable and to decide that what you cannot measure must be uninteresting.": "Donald",
  "In the 1950s, the average person saw science as something that solved problems. With the advent of nuclear weapons and pollution, the idealistic aura around scientific research has been replaced by cynicism.": "Sheldon",
  "I like science - geography, meteorology, cosmology.": "Randy",
  "In all science, error precedes the truth, and it is better it should go first than last.": "Horace",
  "Science is not a game in which arbitrary rules are used to decide what explanations are to be permitted.": "Michael",
  "Bad religion is arrogant, self-righteous, dogmatic and intolerant. And so is bad science. But unlike religious fundamentalists, scientific fundamentalists do not realize that their opinions are based on faith. They think they know the truth.": "Rupert",
  "The simplest and cheapest of all reforms within institutional science is to switch from the passive to the active voice in writing about science.": "Rupert",
  "The facts of science are real enough, and so are the techniques that scientists use, and so are the technologies based on them. But the belief system that governs conventional scientific thinking is an act of faith.": "Rupert",
  "I feel it is unnatural and immoral to try to teach science to children in a foreign language They will know facts, but they will miss the spirit.": "C.",

  "Half of the modern drugs could well be thrown out of the window, except that the birds might eat them.": "Martin",
  "Science rests on reason and experiment, and can meet an opponent with calmness; but a belief is always sensitive.": "James",
  "When I began writing science fiction in the middle '60s, it seemed very easy to find ideas that took decades to percolate into the cultural consciousness; now the lead time seems more like eighteen months.": "Vernor",
  "Science by itself is about numbers, and it's about measuring things. It's very important but it's very dry.": "James",
  "Science is what we understand well enough to explain to a computer. Art is everything else we do.": "Donald",
  "Scientific advancement should aim to affirm and to improve human life.": "Nathan",
  "American science is much more organized, much more hierarchical than British science has been.": "Martin",
  "Perhaps writers should never be allowed to get together in a workplace context. It's not like studying computer science, after all. The emotions are at large, and are shared and are questioned. There is a vulnerability.": "Graham",

  "People ask me how I do research for my science fiction. The answer is, I never do any research.": "Frederik",
  "If you don't care about science enough to be interested in it on its own, you shouldn't try to write hard science fiction. You can write like Ray Bradbury and Harlan Ellison as much as you want.": "Frederik",
  "Art and science are intrinsically the same except for one thing. The universe is in control of your science, whether it's right or wrong, and the public are in control of your art - if they're going to buy it, if you're going to make a living that way.": "Harry",
  "Science of mind teaches you how to realize how much control you have over your own life. It teaches you that we have the ability to change our lives at any point we choose.": "Marla",
  "One of the responsibilities faced by the Environmental Genome Project is to provide the science base upon which society can make better informed risk management decisions.": "Samuel",
  "When you're looking that far out, you're giving people their place in the universe, it touches people. Science is often visual, so it doesn't need translation. It's like poetry, it touches you.": "Story",
  "Dream research is a wonderful field. All you do is sleep for a living.": "Stephen",
  "The wise man regulates his conduct by the theories both of religion and science. But he regards these theories not as statements of ultimate fact but as art-forms.": "John",
  "The virtues of science are skepticism and independence of thought.": "Walter",
  "These maxims and the art of interpreting them may be said to constitute the premisses of science but I prefer to call them our scientific beliefs. These premisses or beliefs are embodied in a tradition, the tradition of science.": "Michael",
  "Science has become something that everybody knows he has to pay attention to, but not everybody is a believer. So I don't think we should equate science with religion. But, that science is progressively playing a more and more important part in the life of every individual is obvious.": "Chen-Ning",
  "My education in the public schools of New York City between 1932 and 1944 was an excellent preparation for a life in science. Because of the Depression, these schools were able to attract a remarkably talented and dedicated collection of teachers who encouraged their students to strive for the highest levels of accomplishment.": "Robert",
  "Science has faith. We make postulates. We can't prove those postulates, but we have faith in them.": "Charles",
  "I didn't study science beyond high school level, but I'd been reading a lot of science books by people like Richard Dawkins, Matt Ridley and Daniel Dennett. I also spent a year working on a fellowship in a research centre - the Allan Wilson Centre - where I got a hands-on look at their work sequencing DNA.": "Bernard",

  "Facts are the air of scientists. Without them you can never fly.": "Linus",
  "I describe management as arts, crafts and science. It is a practice that draws on arts, craft and science and there is a lot of craft - meaning experience - there is a certain amount of craft meaning insight, creativity and vision, and there is the use of science, technique or analysis.": "Henry",
  "Science will liberate us from the chains of big cities and lead us back to nature.": "Lennart",
  "Painting is a science, and should be pursued as an inquiry into the laws of nature.": "John",

  "Novel technologies and ideas that impinge on human biology and their perceived impact on human values have renewed strains in the relationship between science and society.": "Paul",
  "I actually wanted to be a forensic scientist for a while. When I was doing my Standard Grades, three of them were science subjects. The interest in science didn't wear off, but I found other interests.": "Emun",
  "It is pure mythology that women cannot perform as well as men in science, engineering and mathematics. In my experience, the opposite is true: Women are often more adept and patient at untangling complex problems, multitasking, seeing the possibilities in new solutions and winning team support for collaborative action.": "Weili",
  "The phonograph and kinetoscope may some day seize and perpetuate all save the magnetic touch, but that weird, illusive, indefinable yet wonderfully real power by which the orator subdues may never be caught by science or preserved for the cruel dissecting knife of the critic.": "David",
  "My own writing has perhaps more of an American flavor than a British one, but that's because the stories I've so far written have needed it. 'Empire State,' 'Seven Wonders' and 'The Age Atomic' are all very place-centric, where the setting itself is almost a character. But there is a universality to story that isn't just limited to science fiction.": "Adam",
  "Language is conceived in sin and science is its redemption.": "Willard",
  "You can never properly predict the future as it really turns out. So you are doing something a little different when you write science fiction. You are trying to take a different perspective on now.": "Kim",
  "I found myself facing a Christian Science Reading Room. My God! It had been eight years. There had never been any renunciation of religion on my part, but like so many people, it was a gradual fading away.": "Henry",
  "I've been thinking about the distorted view of science that prevails in our culture. I've been wondering about this, because our civilization is completely dependent on science and high technology, yet most of us are alienated from science.": "Ann",
  "Death is not the end it is but one more step in a great forward march made possible by the redemption wrought by the Savior. This is the spirit of true science - constant and eternal seeking. ": "Henry",

  "It is a law woven into the nature of man, attested by history, by science, by literature and art, and by dally experience, that strength of mind and force of character are the supreme rulers of human affairs.": "Lucius",
  "I like the freedom of research. Plus, if I fail in science, I know I can always survive because I have an M.D. This has been my insurance policy.": "Shinya",

  "I remember in 1967, when there was that terrible fire on NASA's Apollo 1 rocket that killed three astronauts, my father made pure oxygen and we lit this tiny cup and burned it. Suddenly, we had an unbelievable jet and a fire. You just could see exactly what had happened.": "Jack",
  "There is actually a fair amount of money being put behind science today.": "David",
  "I love science fiction. There are ways in which this community kept me and my partner alive through some very, very bad years, and I will always acknowledge that.": "Nalo",

  "The historian of science may be tempted to exclaim that when paradigms change, the world itself changes with them.": "Thomas",
  "Scientific theory is a contrived foothold in the chaos of living phenomena.": "Wilhelm",

  "Polygraph tests are 20th-century witchcraft.": "Sam",
  "Let us embrace Science and the new technologies unfettered, for it is these which will liberate mankind from the myth of god, and free us from our age old fears, from disease, death and the sweat of labor.": "Claude",
  "Science is imagination in the service of the verifiable truth, and that service is indeed communal. It cannot be rigidly planned. Rather, it requires freedom and courage and the plural contributions of many different kinds of people who must maintain their individuality while giving to the group.": "Gerald",
  "Whenever anyone says, 'theoretically,' they really mean, 'not really.'": "Dave",
  "Anthropology was the science that gave her the platform from which she surveyed, scolded and beamed at the world.": "Jane",
  "The more we learn of science, the more we see that its wonderful mysteries are all explained by a few simple laws so connected together and so dependent upon each other, that we see the same mind animating them all.": "Olympia",
  "It's very satisfying to promote science and education and see good results. Setting a good example for young people, being a role model, is very important for me.": "Yuan",
  "If I had my choice, every high school would be teaching financial literacy along with math and science.": "Gregory",
  "Because some of my at-home life was rough and lonely, I often looked to escape into my imagination. Science fiction provided a deep well to pull from and was something easily accessible to me.": "Keahu",

  "Science progresses best when observations force us to alter our preconceptions.": "Vera",
  "If I may take the liberty to speak for science at least, today his name and his prizes are without a peer in the world. He not only elevates science but he influences it as well.": "Melvin",
  "About the time you might start to think that science fiction - the real stuff, not the species of fantasy that goes under the name - is really dead, along comes a story by Cory Doctorow.": "Lois",
  "There was no 'before' the beginning of our universe, because once upon a time there was no time.": "John",

  "Education is the key to success in life, and teachers make a lasting impact in the lives of their students.": "Solomon",

  "My father was my teacher. But most importantly he was a great dad.": "Beau",
  "Heroes represent the best of ourselves, respecting that we are human beings. A hero can be anyone from Gandhi to your classroom teacher, anyone who can show courage when faced with a problem. A hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity.": "Ricky",
  "Good teachers know how to bring out the best in students.": "Charles",
  "I am a teacher. It's how I define myself. A good teacher isn't someone who gives the answers out to their kids but is understanding of needs and challenges and gives tools to help other people succeed. That's the way I see myself, so whatever it is that I will do eventually after politics, it'll have to do a lot with teaching.": "Justin",
  "Everyone who remembers his own education remembers teachers, not methods and techniques. The teacher is the heart of the educational system.": "Sidney",
  "Experience is the teacher of all things.": "Julius",
  "A teacher affects eternity he can never tell where his influence stops. ": "Henry",

  "Of all the hard jobs around, one of the hardest is being a good teacher.": "Maggie",
  "One looks back with appreciation to the brilliant teachers, but with gratitude to those who touched our human feelings. The curriculum is so much necessary raw material, but warmth is the vital element for the growing plant and for the soul of the child.": "Carl",
  "Research shows that there is only half as much variation in student achievement between schools as there is among classrooms in the same school. If you want your child to get the best education possible, it is actually more important to get him assigned to a great teacher than to a great school.": "Bill",
  "There's no question that a great teacher can make a huge difference in a student's achievement, and we need to recruit, train and reward more such teachers. But here's what some new studies are also showing: We need better parents. Parents more focused on their children's education can also make a huge difference in a student's achievement.": "Thomas",
  "The one exclusive sign of thorough knowledge is the power of teaching.": "Aristotle",
  "A word of encouragement from a teacher to a child can change a life. A word of encouragement from a spouse can save a marriage. A word of encouragement from a leader can inspire a person to reach her potential.": "John",
  "A good teacher, like a good entertainer first must hold his audience's attention, then he can teach his lesson.": "John",

  "The art of teaching is the art of assisting discovery.": "Mark",

  "Study how water flows in a valley stream, smoothly and freely between the rocks. Also learn from holy books and wise people. Everything - even mountains, rivers, plants and trees - should be your teacher.": "Morihei",
  "There is no employing class, no working class, no farming class. You may pigeonhole a man or woman as a farmer or a worker or a professional man or an employer or even a banker. But the son of the farmer will be a doctor or a worker or even a banker, and his daughter a teacher. The son of a worker will be an employer - or maybe president.": "Herbert",
  "I have learned that, although I am a good teacher, I am a much better student, and I was blessed to learn valuable lessons from my students on a daily basis. They taught me the importance of teaching to a student - and not to a test.": "Erin",

  "Those who know how to think need no teachers.": "Mahatma",
  "A garden is a grand teacher. It teaches patience and careful watchfulness it teaches industry and thrift above all it teaches entire trust. ": "Gertrude",
  "The main difference in the effectiveness of teaching comes from the thoughts the teacher has had during the entire time of his or her existence and brings into the classroom. A teacher concerned with developing humans affects the students quite differently from a teacher who never thinks about such things.": "Rudolf",
  "I was lucky that I met the right mentors and teachers at the right moment.": "James",
  "The duties of a teacher are neither few nor small, but they elevate the mind and give energy to the character.": "Dorothea",
  "The thing I loved the most - and still love the most about teaching - is that you can connect with an individual or a group, and see that individual or group exceed their limits.": "Mike",
  "Every child should have a caring adult in their lives. And that's not always a biological parent or family member. It may be a friend or neighbor. Often times it is a teacher.": "Joe",
  "There is no recipe to be a great teacher, that's what is unique about them.": "Robert",
  "The Holy Spirit is our comforter, our teacher. That's why, in prayer, we can ask the Lord to open up Scripture and make it come alive to us, to open our understanding. He left his Spirit with us until we join him in Heaven.": "Michele",
  "A good teacher who can take the zero pay and help kids develop physically, emotionally, socially, is literally an angel.": "Eva",
  "The whole art of teaching is only the art of awakening the natural curiosity of young minds for the purpose of satisfying it afterwards.": "Anatole",
  "My heart is singing for joy this morning! A miracle has happened! The light of understanding has shone upon my little pupil's mind, and behold, all things are changed!": "Anne",
  "If you have to put someone on a pedestal, put teachers. They are society's heroes.": "Guy",
  "You never stop learning. If you have a teacher, you never stop being a student.": "Elisabeth",
  "I would say that my role model, as far as just somebody leading by example, which to me is what a great youth counselor does - they are there to talk to and lead by example - would be my mom, but she wasn't a youth counselor. She was a teacher, and she is a good person and definitely one of the biggest influences in my life.": "Carrie",
  "Disobedience is essentially a prideful power struggle against someone in authority over us. It can be a parent, a priesthood leader, a teacher, or ultimately God. A proud person hates the fact that someone is above him. He thinks this lowers his position.": "Ezra",
  "The task of the mediator is to help the parties to open difficult issues and nudge them forward in the peace process. The mediator's role combines those of a ship's pilot, consulting medical doctor, midwife and teacher.": "Martti",
  "I saw as a teacher how, if you take that spark of learning that those children have, and you ignite it, you can take a child from any background to a lifetime of creativity and accomplishment.": "Paul",
  "Most of us end up with no more than five or six people who remember us. Teachers have thousands of people who remember them for the rest of their lives.": "Andy",
  "Experience is a good teacher, but she sends in terrific bills.": "Minna",
  "If I am walking with two other men, each of them will serve as my teacher. I will pick out the good points of the one and imitate them, and the bad points of the other and correct them in myself.": "Confucius",
  "None of us got where we are solely by pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps. We got here because somebody - a parent, a teacher, an Ivy League crony or a few nuns - bent down and helped us pick up our boots.": "Thurgood",
  "Money is such an amazing teacher: What you choose to do with your money shows whether you are truly powerful or powerless.": "Suze",
  "I remember my choir teacher in high school told me, 'When in doubt, sing loud.' I'm a terrible singer, but I always auditioned for the musicals, and would get cast in them because I really would just put it all out there. That was really good advice, and I think it works for everything, not just acting.": "Judy",
  "Having been an educator for so many years I know that all a good teacher can do is set a context, raise questions or enter into a kind of a dialogic relationship with their students.": "Godfrey",
  "The smarter the journalists are, the better off society is. For to a degree, people read the press to inform themselves - and the better the teacher, the better the student body.": "Warren",

  "Creative activity could be described as a type of learning process where teacher and pupil are located in the same individual.": "Arthur",
  "I was born 50 years after slavery, in 1913. I was allowed to read. My mother, who was a teacher, taught me when I was a very young child. The first school I attended was a small building that went from first to sixth grade. There was one teacher for all of the students. There could be anywhere from 50 to 60 students of all different ages.": "Rosa",

  "The most important part of teaching is to teach what it is to know.": "Simone",
  "On the first day of school, my teacher, Miss Mdingane, gave each of us an English name and said that from thenceforth that was the name we would answer to in school. This was the custom among Africans in those days and was undoubtedly due to the British bias of our education.": "Nelson",
  "When I go to bed at night, I ask God to give me another day; I ask him to keep me strong and make me a good teacher and to keep spreading this right word.": "Richard",
  "I was never a class clown or anything like that, but I do remember being in the first grade and my teacher, Mr. Chad, told the class one day that we were going to do some exercises. He meant math exercises, but I stood up and started doing jumping jacks. To this day, I don't know what possessed me to do that, but all my friends cracked up.": "Will",
  "Pride adversely affects all our relationships - our relationship with God and His servants, between husband and wife, parent and child, employer and employee, teacher and student, and all mankind.": "Ezra",
  "The five steps in teaching an employee new skills are preparation, explanation, showing, observation and supervision.": "Bruce",

  "I flunked my exam for university two times before I was accepted by what was considered my city's worst university, Hangzhou Teachers University. I was studying to be a high school English teacher. In my university, I was elected student chairman and later became chairman of the city's Students Federation.": "Jack",
  "When you become a parent, or a teacher, you turn into a manager of this whole system. You become the person controlling the bubble of innocence around a child, regulating it.": "Kazuo",
  "Teaching is the only major occupation of man for which we have not yet developed tools that make an average person capable of competence and performance. In teaching we rely on the 'naturals', the ones who somehow know how to teach.": "Peter",

  "The best teacher is very interactive.": "Bill",
  "I don't know anybody who said, 'I love that teacher, he or she gave a really good homework set,' or 'Boy, that was the best class I ever took because those exams were awesome.' That's not what people want to talk about. It's not what influences people in one profession or another.": "Neil",
  "What my father gave me more than anything else is great tutoring and a great brain, frankly. You know, my father's brother was a top person at MIT, went to MIT, graduated from MIT, was a teacher at MIT, a professor at MIT, a great engineer. I mean, you know, I have very good genes.": "Donald",

  "I have been a teacher myself all my life. I have an intense passion to share with people. Our only salvation is in knowledge, in learning.": "Leo",
  "When I was a kid in junior high, I had an assignment to discuss how to rescue poor people in India. I remember my teacher at the time considered it an impossible problem. Now, we're not talking that way anymore. We're sure not talking about that for China. They're rescuing themselves thanks to globalization.": "Chrystia",
  "We should not run away from religious teachings. We should run to them.": "James",
  "One time, the teacher was the storehouse of knowledge. That will no longer be so. So what would a teacher do? A very good teacher will play the role of augmenter. Also, the teacher will be located anywhere and helping students.": "Shiv",
  "I wrote about a bird that cleaned a crocodile's teeth. The story was so good that my teacher could not believe that a ten-year-old could write that well. I was even punished because my teacher thought I'd lied about writing it! I had always loved to write, but it was then that I realized that I had a talent for it.": "Brian",

  "I've got a friend who is a lion tamer. He used to be a school teacher till he lost his nerve.": "Les",
  "As a little girl, I didn't like stories about little girls. I liked stories about dragons and beasts and princes and princesses and fear and terror and the Four Musketeers and almost anything other than nice little girls making moral decisions about whether to tell the teacher about what the other little girl did or did not do.": "A.",
  "Research confirms that great teachers change lives. Students with one highly effective elementary school teacher are more likely to go to college, less likely to become pregnant as teens, and earn tens of thousands more over their lifetimes.": "Wendy",
  "You can get help from teachers, but you are going to have to learn a lot by yourself, sitting alone in a room.": "Dr.",
  "A hallmark of the Latino community is to help one another, if students are interested in a way to give back and help their communities, becoming a teacher is probably one of the very best ways of doing that.": "Ellen",
  "Ask any successful person, and most will tell you that they had a person who believed in them... a teacher, a friend, a parent, a guardian, a sister, a grandmother. It only takes one person, and it doesn't really matter who it is.": "Sean",
  "When I had my first voice lesson I was 15 years old. And I had a really good teacher. This is what made all the difference. A good teacher will teach you the technique, but also how to listen to your voice.": "Cecilia",

  "I've learned that mistakes can often be as good a teacher as success.": "Jack",
  "The teacher must derive not only the capacity, but the desire, to observe natural phenomena. The teacher must understand and feel her position of observer: the activity must lie in the phenomenon.": "Maria",
  "I was born in Corpus Christi, Texas, the youngest of four girls, including my oldest sister, Lisa, who has special needs. My mom was a special education teacher, and my dad worked on the Army base. We weren't wealthy, but we were determined to succeed.": "Eva",
  "So what does a good teacher do? Create tension - but just the right amount.": "Donald",
  "I worked in theater my whole life. My mom was a drama teacher at my middle school. In high school, I was Drama Club President every year, and then I auditioned for conservatory acting programs.": "Jenn",
  "We don't classify all doctors as incompetent because of the infrequent instances of medical malpractice. We don't use the example of one bad teacher in our children's school to draw a negative conclusion of the entire teaching profession. We should apply that same rational standard when it comes to how we view law enforcement.": "Thom",
  "Why not whip the teacher when the pupil misbehaves?": "Diogenes",
  "The two things I was positive about in life were that I was going to be a teacher at a boarding school or an operative with the CIA posted abroad. I could write a book about all the things I was sure about.": "Tucker",

  "But the fact is, no matter how good the teacher, how small the class, how focused on quality education the school may be none of this matters if we ignore the individual needs of our students.": "Roy",
  "I didn't want to be the archetypal sponging brother-in-law, so I didn't go into acting when I got to the States. I thought, 'No, I'll go to school and then I'll be an English teacher; that'll be fun.' But I was horrible as a teacher. As hard as I tried, I just couldn't inspire those kids to take an interest in Milton and Shakespeare and Donne.": "John",
  "I'm a teacher still, but with a much larger classroom.": "Rick",
  "To say what I would have been if I wasn't boxing, I don't know why, but I always wanted to be an x-ray technician or a substitute teacher. Those two occupations always stuck with me, maybe because my substitute teacher didn't give us homework, or because I've always had x-rays of my hands.": "Sugar",
  "There is nothing more valuable than great classroom instruction. But let's stop putting the whole burden on teachers. We also need better parents. Better parents can make every teacher more effective.": "Thomas",
  "Being a teacher is back-breakingly difficult work. It is also extremely important work.": "Timothy",
  "To me, the avocation of a teacher has something elevating and exciting. While surrounded by the young, one may always be doing good.": "Dorothea",
  "The Chinese mom is not the helicopter mom. I would never do their homework for them. It's all about: Take responsibility, don't blame others. Be self-reliant. Never blame the teacher.": "Amy",
  "When I was eight, an uncle, great uncle, gave a violin to me, and my father took me off to have lessons. After about six weeks, the violin teacher told my father he was wasting his money, wasting his time, and wasting my time, and it's one of my big regrets.": "Roger",
  "I'd never been a teacher before, and here I was starting my first day with these eager students. There was a shortage of teachers, and they had been without a math teacher for six months. They were so excited to learn math.": "Andrew",
  "I have always believed that 98% of a student's progress is due to his own efforts, and 2% to his teacher.": "John",
  "When people say, you know, 'Good teacher,' 'Prophet,' 'Really nice guy'... this is not how Jesus thought of Himself. So you're left with a challenge in that, which is either Jesus was who he said he was or a complete and utter nut case. You have to make a choice on that.": "Bono",
  "My happiest memory of childhood was my first birthday in reform school. This teacher took an interest in me. In fact, he gave me the first birthday presents I ever got: a box of Cracker Jacks and a can of ABC shoe polish.": "Flip",
  "As a former high school teacher and a student in a class of 60 urchins at St. Brigid's grammar school, I know that education is all about discipline and motivation. Disadvantaged students need extra attention, a stable school environment, and enough teacher creativity to stimulate their imaginations. Those things are not expensive.": "Bill",
  "After all manner of professors have done their best for us, the place we are to get knowledge is in books. The true university of these days is a collection of books.": "Albert",

  "I had a terrible education. I attended a school for emotionally disturbed teachers.": "Woody",

  "We can teach a lot of things, but if the teacher can't relate by talking to a group of friendly students, he'll never be a competent teacher.": "William",
  "I believe in God - not in a Catholic God; there is no Catholic God. There is God, and I believe in Jesus Christ, his incarnation. Jesus is my teacher and my pastor, but God, the Father, Abba, is the light and the Creator. This is my Being.": "Pope",
  "I never made it to the school choir because the music teacher didn't like my voice. I was pretty sad. But he was probably right; I did have a voice a bit like a goat, but my dad told me to never give up and to keep going, and it's paid off.": "Shakira",
  "My sister and I cooked a lot together; my sister was a very healthy vegetarian. She was always a real good teacher for me about organics, recycling, composting -whenever you hear me talk about it, it's usually because of my sister's influence.": "Guy",

  "No bubble is so iridescent or floats longer than that blown by the successful teacher.": "William",
  "China's republican politics is like a child who just started schooling. He must have a good teacher and be surrounded by good friends. By the same token, the Chinese people, new to the republican politics, must be educated properly.

  "If you put down a list of jobs, doctor, lawyer, janitor, teacher or movie star, everybody would pick the movie star. And why? So you could lie around the pool, drink margaritas and send money to your parents. So that's what I did.": "Steve",
  "What students lack in school is an intellectual relationship or conversation with the teacher.": "William",
  "Every single major push in education has made it worse and right now it's really bad because everything we've done is de-humanizing education. It's destroying the possibility of the teacher and the student having a warm, friendly, intellectual relationship.": "William",
  "You never know what's going to happen. My mother was an English teacher. If someone had told her that I was going to write a book, she would never have believed that. So you can never say never.": "Tony",
  "In high school, a teacher once suggested that I be a math major in college. I thought, 'Me? You've got to be joking!' I mean, in junior high, I used to come home and cry because I was so afraid of my math homework. Seriously, I was terrified of math.": "Danica",
  "There is no education system in the world - none at all - that's better than its average teacher.": "David",
  "My parents made it clear that I should never display even the slightest disrespect to individuals who had the power to let me skip a half grade or move into more challenging classes. While it was all right for me to know more about a topic than my sixth-grade teacher had ever learned, questioning her facts could only lead to trouble.": "James",
  "My view, as one who taught it, is that the whole purpose of a literary education should be to tell people that these things exist. I don't think any teacher should try to 'teach an author,' but rather simply describe what the author has written. And this is what I tried to do.": "Guy",
  "You can play professional lacrosse, but they make less than a teacher's salary now. I always thought about that. And it's a very difficult career, a short career, as a pro athlete.": "Nash",
  "When you play a sax, that saxophone is irreverent. It's noisy; it's a trickster... you cannot hide the saxophone in your hands, so it's a good teacher.": "Joy",

  "No one wanted me to be a conscientious objector. My parents certainly didn't want it. My teacher and mentor, Joe Brearley, didn't want it. My friends didn't want it. I was alone.": "Harold",
  "My dad, who was a teacher, used to tell me that a teacher's goal should be for every one of their students to get an A. If that's your goal every day - to make every student or player learn - then it doesn't matter if you won last year or didn't win. When next year's team shows up, I try to help every player become as good as they can be.": "Tony",
  "I always think about which blood drive was going on in Georgia that day when that husband or mom or school teacher rolled up their sleeve and actually gave me a second chance at life. It's the ultimate gift of life, and I'm the one who was on the other end.": "Niki",
  "I got picked on a lot, even by teachers too. I liked to listen to musicals and bake, and my homeroom teacher found out and mocked me in front of the whole class for baking.": "Dan",
  "When I was very, very young, seven years old, I heard there was school where you could go to learn to draw. That was my absolute driven passion, to become an artist or a painter. So the romantic realist in me, I studied to be a graphic design artist and an art teacher.": "David",
  "My family was going back to England to visit my mother's grandmother, who was very ill. We went up to Liverpool and I met my great-aunt, who was just a force of nature. She was an elocution teacher and a huge enthusiast for theater and the classics. I took her amateur acting class, and she was really impressed with me.": "Kim",

  "Whenever someone like a plumber or a mechanic tries to explain something technical to me, I listen for about three seconds before it all just becomes white noise, like Charlie Brown's teacher.": "John",
  "I used to write things for friends. There was this girl I had a crush on, and she had a teacher she didn't like at school. I had a real crush on her, so almost every day I would write her a little short story where she would kill him in a different way.": "Stephen",
  "I'd like to think I'm a great teacher.": "Gordon",
  "I had a teacher who loved movies. He had a little theatre called The Flick, and he would let a bunch of us volunteer to work there, and he also let us make little movies in class.": "Kathleen",
  "My name is James Edward Franco. Ted is a nickname for Edward. That's what my parents called me. I also got 'Teddy Ruxpin' a lot. It just got to a point where I got sick of it, so when a teacher called out 'James Franco' my junior year of high school, I didn't correct her.": "James",
  "Mary and Jesus had this extraordinary relationship between them. What a teacher Mary is, really. It is the ultimate trusting; that she had to trust God, that she was so privileged to be the mother of the Savior, that she had to stand there as a mother and watch her son being murdered and trust that that is what he came to do.": "Roma",
  "Experience was my only teacher; I knew little of the modern art movement. When I first saw the works of the Impressionists, van Gogh, van Dongen, and Fauves, I admired it. But I had to seek the true way alone.": "Piet",
  "The primary task of a useful teacher is to teach his students to recognize 'inconvenient' facts - I mean facts that are inconvenient for their party opinions.": "Max",
  "When I was nine, the teacher asked us to write a piece about our village fete. He read mine in class. I was encouraged and continued. I even wanted to write my memoirs at the age of ten. At twelve I wrote poetry, mostly about friendship - 'Ode to Friendship.' Then my class wanted to make a film, and one little boy suggested that I write the script.": "Eugene",
  "I call myself a teacher because they want me to call myself a teacher, but actually, what I'm doing is I'm studying.": "Chick",
  "Before I got Doctor Who, I went to the Guildhall School of Music and Drama. I went back to take the final grade exam, which is the grade you have to take before you can take the teacher's diploma.": "Sarah",
  "I'm trained as a teacher that's the only thing I've got a certificate for. ": "Quentin",
  "It's funny: I always, as a high school teacher and particularly as a high school yearbook teacher, because yearbook staffs are 90 percent female, I got to sit in and overhear teenage girl talk for many years. I like teenage girls; I like their drama, their foibles. And I think, 'I'll be good with a teenage daughter!'": "Rob",
  "I wasn't a ballet baby. My first dance class was in an outdoor pavilion when I was three. It was called 'creative movement.' The teacher gave us chiffon scarves in beautiful colors. She turned on some music and said, 'Now go dance.' So for me, dance has always been about self-expression.": "Carrie",
  "In every role that I do - whether I'm a teacher, actor or mentor - I do it with total dedication and as much honesty as I feel is required because there's no alternative to honesty and hard work.": "Anupam",
  "I was a victim of a stereotype. There were only two of us Negro kids in the whole class, and our English teacher was always stressing the importance of rhythm in poetry. Well, everybody knows - except us - that all Negroes have rhythms, so they elected me class poet.": "Langston",
  "I have been luckier than anyone I know or even heard of. I had a very happy childhood, a good education, I enjoyed working as a teacher, journalist and author. I have loved a wonderful man for over 33 years, and I believe he loves me, too.": "Maeve",
  "I will venture to maintain that where the teacher is not pleasing to the pupil, there is no education.": "Xenophon",
  "My mother had been an English teacher in India before she came to the U.K., and she taught me to read early on - not only in English, but in Hindi, too. My teachers didn't like the fact that I was reading more quickly than they were teaching, and as a consequence, I would sometimes get bored in class.": "Sanjeev",
  "I discovered Deborah Ellis's books in the school library after my head teacher encouraged me to go beyond the school curriculum and look for books I might enjoy.": "Malala",
  "Above all, we must be conscious of the primary pedagogical task, namely that we must first make something of ourselves so that a living inner spiritual relationship exists between the teacher and the children.": "Rudolf",
  "You can't tell a woman who is called by God to teach that she cannot teach the Word of God... So I think the distinction is that there's a difference between the authority of a pastor and a Bible teacher.": "Charles",
  "Connie Heermann is a Freedom Writer teacher. I believe she represents the best of what dedicated teachers can be because she chose to serve her students, not her school board.": "Richard",
  "I remember in grammar school the teacher asked if anyone had any hobbies. I was the only one with any hobbies and I had every hobby there was... name anything, no matter how esoteric. I could have given everyone a hobby and still had 40 or 50 to take home.": "Cormac",
  "I liked school, but I used to dread those moments when the teacher would call me up to give an oral report. I forced myself to deal with it and not dwell on the class in front of me - to keep a straight face, give the report and concentrate on getting it right. That's normally how I perform. That's how I am.": "Steven",
  "Often, when people ask me what I read as a young girl, I lie. Or, I should say, I lie by omission. I tell them about my brilliant fourth-grade teacher, Miss Artis, who assigned us 'Johnny Tremain' and 'Where the Red Fern Grows' and 'Tuck Everlasting,' all books that made an impression on me. And people nod in approval.": "Cristina",
  "During my eleven years as a New York City public school teacher, I saw firsthand the impact that poverty has on the classroom. In low-income neighborhoods like Sunset Park, where I taught, students as young as five years old enter school affected by the stresses often created by poverty: domestic violence, drug abuse, gang activity.": "Sal",
  "I like a lot of things about yoga - its an intro to good music; with each good teacher you study with, you learn a lot about them personally; it's not just about specific technique or poses. I also like Shavasana - not too many exercise routines let you nap at the end of them. You don't see nap pods in CrossFit gyms.": "Charles",
  "Most of my teachers wanted to send me to the principal's office. But my fourth-grade teacher once put her arms around me and said, 'You sure write well.' And I've had good penmanship until this day. She was the only one who ever said anything nice to me. That's the kind of motivation that students need.": "Andrew",
  "That is the difference between good teachers and great teachers: good teachers make the best of a pupil's means great teachers foresee a pupil's ends. ": "Maria",
  "Therefore, a person should first be changed by a teacher's instructions, and guided by principles of ritual. Only then can he observe the rules of courtesy and humility, obey the conventions and rules of society, and achieve order.": "Xun",

  "Only one person in a million becomes enlightened without a teacher's help.": "Bodhidharma",
  "My art teacher in junior high was a very out gay man and a mentor to me. He would tell us about Greenwich Village and show us the 'Village Voice' and describe his life, but it was all sort of subversive and below the radar.": "Gus",
  "I am a teacher born and bred, and I believe in the advocacy of teachers. It's a calling. We want our students to feel impassioned and empowered.": "Erin",
  "The drawing teacher has this problem of communicating how to draw by osmosis and not by instruction, while the physics teacher has the problem of always teaching techniques, rather than the spirit, of how to go about solving physical problems.": "Richard",
  "The best teacher is an entertainer.": "Bob",
  "It is by teaching that we teach ourselves, by relating that we observe, by affirming that we examine, by showing that we look, by writing that we think, by pumping that we draw water into the well.": "Henri",

  "I want to thank my mum, my daddy, my coach, my teacher, everybody in my life.": "Jet",
  "The teacher's life should have three periods, study until twenty-five, investigation until forty, profession until sixty, at which age I would have him retired on a double allowance.": "William",
  "My first plays were amazingly bad, but I had a teacher who thought I had promise, and he kept working with me. I finally went to a summer workshop before my senior year with people like Sam Shepard and Maria Irene Fornes who encouraged me to write from my subconscious, and suddenly all this material about culture clash came out.": "David",
  "I eat tons, three full meals a day, and I never go to the gym. When I was a child, my geography teacher said, 'You may be slim now but if you carry on eating like that, you'll end up being really fat.' Fortunately, I really don't think I've changed much in the past two decades, so that teacher was an idiot.": "Gina",
  "My grandmother was a teacher, my sister was a teacher, my daughter was a teacher and is now a superintendent in northern California, and my son-in-law is a high school principal. I am surrounded.": "Loni",
  "I love films that make me react emotionally and physically when you walk out of the cinema. Two of my favorite films however have got to be 'The Tree Of Life' and 'The Piano Teacher,' which also stars one of my favourite actresses Isabelle Huppert.": "Alicia",

  "Experience is the best teacher of all. And for that, there are no guarantees that one will become an artist. Only the journey matters.": "Harry",
  "Once I understood Bach's music, I wanted to be a concert pianist. Bach made me dedicate my life to music, and it was that teacher who introduced me to his world.": "Nina",
  "But the idea that I should be a teacher and a researcher of some sort did not vary over the years.": "Amartya",
  "I really enjoyed hanging out with some of the teachers. This one chemistry teacher, she liked hanging out. I liked making explosives. We would stay after school and blow things up.": "Maya",
  "This is at the heart of all good education, where the teacher asks students to think and engages them in encouraging dialogues, constantly checking for understanding and growth.": "William",
  "We often grow up being told that we can do this or that, but if you don't see anybody that looks like you doing it, you don't believe you can do it. But I had great teachers, and I wanted to be a great teacher.": "Jesse",
  "I remember when I was in school I had this teacher give me this E.L. Doctorow quote: They asked him how much historical research he does for his books and he said, 'As little as possible.' So I try and adhere to that.": "Scott",

  "I'm blessed because I had my mom as a teacher - sixth through eighth grade - and she is one of the best teachers I've ever had.": "Bellamy",
  "I receive emails from readers that both break my heart and give me a profound sense of connection. Several months ago, I received an email from a teacher who told me that 'Legend' was the first book one of her troubled young students had ever read to the end. He cried when he finished it. Stories like that stay with you forever.": "Marie",
  "There's many a bestseller that could have been prevented by a good teacher.": "Flannery",
  "I believe that the testing of the student's achievements in order to see if he meets some criterion held by the teacher, is directly contrary to the implications of therapy for significant learning.": "Carl",
  "They should regard me as what I am. I am a spiritual leader and teacher.": "Louis",
  "In other words, if a teacher only teaches in one way, then they conclude that the kids who can't learn well that way don't have the ability, when, in fact, it may be that the way the teacher's teaching is not a particularly good match to the way those kids learn.": "Robert",
  "I had a heartbreaking experience when I was 9. I always wanted to be a guard. The most wonderful girl in the world was a guard. When I got polio and then went back to school, they made me a guard. A teacher took away my guard button.": "Francis",

  "What is the benefit of fasting in our body while filling our souls with innumerable evils? He who does not play at dice, but spends his leisure otherwise, what nonsense does he not utter? What absurdities does he not listen to? Leisure without the fear of God is, for those who do not know how to use time, the teacher of wickedness.": "Saint",

  "I was a high-school teacher. I am a strong advocate for women's rights, and I'm not a woman.": "Justin",
  "I always think the relationship between a teacher and a student should be short and maybe violent. You don't need to spend years together. All you need is an explosion: you are the material to explode the teacher is the detonator. ": "Pierre",

  "I was a bookworm who aced every test - until third grade, when my teacher handed out a pop quiz about Jesus and the Apostles.": "Caroline",
  "I had a science teacher in middle school who inspired me... simply because she acknowledged me and made me feel that what I had to offer was worthy.": "Marcia",
  "Events are the best teacher for us. You try to learn from people, there is always some bend to it.": "Yoko",
  "When we become a really mature, grown-up, wise society, we will put teachers at the center of the community, where they belong. We don't honor them enough, we don't pay them enough.": "Charles",
  "If a teacher does not involve himself, his values, his commitments, in the course of discussion, why should the students?": "Paul",

  "I was very studious, too much. I would never go out at weekends. I was very serious. You should have seen me in class - I was blushing and sweating every time the teacher asked me something.": "Eva",
  "Quite honestly I never had a desire to be an actor. I tell people, I did not choose acting; acting chose me. I never grew up wanting to be an actor. I wanted to play football.

  "I've always remembered something Sanford Meisner, my acting teacher, told us. When you create a character, it's like making a chair, except instead of making someting out of wood, you make it out of yourself. That's the actor's craft - using yourself to create a character.": "Robert",
  "A little girl who finds a puzzle frustrating might ask her busy mother (or teacher) for help. The child gets one message if her mother expresses clear pleasure at the request and quite another if mommy responds with a curt 'Don't bother me - I've got important work to do.'": "Daniel",

  "I took Spanish in high school and I didn't do too well in it. My Spanish teacher told me not to go on with Spanish anymore, so I was discouraged a little bit.": "Tyler",
  "I am a teacher and the reason I'm a teacher is because I'm learning as hard as I can. I'm not any different from anybody else. I am searching and having some success finding answers.": "Andy",
  "Writing is very cathartic for me. As a teacher, I hear many students say that writing can be painful and exhausting. It can be, but ultimately I believe that if you push through, the process is healing and exhilarating.": "Francesca",
  "In my own life, when I was most inspired by a teacher, it always involved a real dialogue, a looseness and a real caring and compassion. It was not without rigor, not without discipline, not without standards, but all that was done out of love.": "Michael",
  "I loved the idea of making history interesting for kids! When Scholastic approached me about 'The 39 Clues', I immediately started going through the 'greatest hits' from my years as a social studies teacher, and picked the historical characters and eras that most appealed to my students.": "Rick",
  "I started out as a high school teacher in inner-city Chicago and realized quite quickly that my students weren't that motivated.": "Jack",
  "I was always shouted at by my teacher because I would draw straight on the table in the school.": "Christian",
  "My mother was a Sunday school teacher. So I am a byproduct of prayer. My mom just kept on praying for her son.": "Steve",
  "I think everyone should take an acting class. It's like therapy because you get to learn a lot about yourself if it's the right teacher. You're putting yourself up there in front of people, and it takes a lot of the intimidation of everyday away.": "Joelle",
  "When I was about ten years old, I gave my teacher an April Fool's sandwich, which had a dead goldfish in it.": "Alan",
  "Jesus isn't lettin' you off the hook. The Scriptures don't let you off the hook so easily... When people say, you know, 'Good teacher', 'Prophet', 'Really nice guy' ... this is not how Jesus thought of Himself.": "Bono",
  "In schools with a history of chaos, the teacher who can keep the classroom calm becomes virtually indispensable.": "Jonathan",
  "I think that 'Floor Sample' is a story of resiliency, a lifelong spiritual search, and a lifelong sense of spiritual companionship that is most often expressed as creativity. My desire in writing the book was to step from behind the icon of 'Julia the teacher' and introduce 'Julia the artist.'": "Julia",
  "I used to work at a school as a teacher's assistant, and my mom is a principal at an elementary school. I don't know, I think that's a pretty good life, teaching kids.": "Conor",
  "I think self-reliance and self-responsibility and self-accountability will help you as a parent, a teacher, as a citizen as a friend.": "Henry",
  "The problem with public school is not overcrowding in the classroom. The problem is not teacher unions. The problem is not underfunding or lack of computer equipment. The problem is your damn kids.": "P.",
  "I don't have freedom in the United States to go into a public school and preach the Gospel, nor is a student free in a public school to pray, or a teacher free to read the Bible publicly to the students. At the same time, we have a great degree of freedom for which I am grateful.": "Billy",
  "To me, a lot of what makes a good actor is not what a teacher tells you to do but how you respond when you're on your own.": "Glenne",
  "Society needs both parents and nonparents, both the work party and the home party. While raising children is the most important work most people will do, not everyone is cut out for parenthood. And, as many a childless teacher has proved, raising kids is not the only important contribution a person can make to their future.": "Virginia",
  "The crudest thing I've done as a teacher was to require students to write a national anthem for their country and sing it themselves.": "Chris",
  "My school friends thought I was outgoing and bubbly, but that masked a lot of insecurities, and maybe that's the reason I chose drama - to build a bit of self-confidence. I had a great teacher, and I won a few speech and drama competitions and just fell in love with it.": "Deborah",
  "Think of your favorite teacher you ever had in school: the one who made it the most fun to go to class. They surprise you. They keep you guessing. They keep you coming back, wanting to know what's going to happen next.": "Pete",
  "I was always getting told off by my choir teacher for, you know, riffing when I shouldn't.": "Rita",
  "Tiger's a horrible golf teacher.": "Stuart",
  "My father was a professor of folklore, and my mother was a teacher until she was married. I had a good relationship with them, and the only argument we had was when I went to university and wanted to go into the theater instead of studying to be a lawyer.": "Max",
  "I was a chemistry major, but I'm always winding up as a teacher in English departments, so I've brought scientific thinking to literature. There's been very little gratitude for this.": "Kurt",
  "I had to get good grades and do well in school - my mother was an assistant principal and my father was a teacher - and they took this very seriously.": "Roz",
  "I remember being in a history lesson and saying to my teacher, 'How come you never talk about black scientists and inventors and pioneers?' And she looked at me and said, 'Because there aren't any.'": "Malorie",
  "My fifth grade teacher Mr. Straussberger noticed I was having trouble with some of my book reports, but he knew I loved to draw. He gave me extra credit if I did a drawing from the book that I was reading.": "Tony",
  "Martial arts is a life journey. One of the things my teacher taught me a long time ago was that everyone's path to the mastery of a certain system is different. Some people's path is a very direct route, where others might wind back and forth if you are injured or something.": "Ryan",
  "Feeling pummeled by the outside pounding of tests and standards, a teacher can easily hide and simply turn to the immediacy of the classroom. It is not surprising that many teachers burrow in their rooms with all that they know about their students. There is no place to take the information.": "Heidi",
  "A teacher told my mother that I would never become successful, which illustrates the difficulty of long-run forecasting on inadequate data.": "Clive",
  "When I was little, I was actually really shy. I really enjoyed doing school plays, but I found the whole thing terrifying. I cried myself to sleep once because I thought my teacher was going to give me the lead role. I never imagined acting was a viable career.": "Emily",
  "I was inspired by many teachers when I started my channel, Bob Ross being one of them. His voice was so soothing, almost like hypnosis. He was that great of a teacher, even the casual viewer could learn how to paint from watching his show. Growing up, I just remember him being so mesmerizing on screen.": "Michelle",
  "At high school, instead of the weekly essay, I would write a poem, and the teacher accepted that. The impulse was one of laziness, I'm certain. Poems were shorter than essays.": "Paul",
  "I feel blessed. I never wanted to be an actor. It just happened all by chance and fate. I was studying to be a teacher.": "John",
  "If I go to a reunion in east Texas, my mother's side or my father's, one out of ten is a preacher or a teacher. That's just the way it is in my family.": "Forest",
  "Ever since I've given up dancing, every physiotherapist or Pilates teacher has said you have to keep moving. If I don't, I'll have a hundred times more injuries because you get weak areas on your body.": "Darcey",
  "You can choose your family sometimes. You can choose people, it could be a teacher, it could be a professor, it could be someone you work with that actually genuinely cares about you and wants you to succeed.": "Nicolas",
  "I'm glad I was a teacher.": "John",
  "I think it goes back to my high school days. In computer class, the first assignment was to write a program to print the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I wrote a program that would steal passwords of students. My teacher gave me an A.": "Kevin",
  "I remember in school once the teacher gave us a speech about anyone can make it if they try, and then she looked at me and said. 'I don't know what you are going to do, Georgie.'": "George",
  "I'm not a writer who teaches. I'm a teacher who writes.": "Maya",
  "I love the idea that it doesn't take one person only to achieve your potential. It takes a village, it takes a community, a street, a teacher, a mother.": "Mira",
  "In high school, I once sang 'Let's Get It On' and 'Brown Sugar' with a band that included my English teacher and my math teacher.": "Chris",
  "When I was eight, my piano teacher played seven or eight notes, and I sang them. She stopped and looked at me in shock! That was the first time I'd gotten that reaction. I'd had looks of horror, but never shock in a positive way.": "Chris",
  "The first programming assignment I had in high school was to find the first 100 Fibonacci numbers. Instead, I thought it would be cooler to write a program to get the teacher's password and all the other students' passwords. And the teacher gave me an A and told the class how smart I was.": "Kevin",
  "I was bought an electric guitar when I was 12, but my guitar teacher beat me up. I didn't like guitar lessons and I got quite bored. My teacher was obviously bored giving me lessons, and one day I offered him a liquorice toffee, but he didn't answer. So I threw it at him, it hit him in the face, and he sort of beat me up.": "Simon",
  "My mother is a special education teacher but also an artist, and my father an advertising executive. They are about as wacky as you can get without being alcoholics.": "Sloane",
  "Actually, acting turned out to be the perfect job for me, because I had a lot of different interests. I thought about being a priest at one point. I thought about being a teacher. I thought about being a lawyer. But I think acting is probably the best job for me.": "John",
  "If a lawyer, if a teacher, if a bus driver, if they're on $40,000 and they get offered a lot more to go somewhere else, what do you think they're going to do?": "Sonny",
  "My teacher told my mum, 'I think William has dyspraxia,' and Mum asked what that meant. She said, 'Well, if I put a chair in the middle of the room and asked every child in the class to walk around it, William would be the only child in the class to walk into it.' Mum was like, 'Yeah, that's my boy'.": "Will",

  "I initially thought I was going to be a teacher. Maybe like an elementary teacher or something like that, which would be fun. Maybe someday.": "Tyler",
  "In a sinful world, no community can exist for long where nobody is ever held accountable: no teacher would grade a student's performance; no citizen would sit on a jury or call a failed leader to account.": "Lewis",
  "I had a great drama teacher in high school, and that's when I started to learn about the history of theater.": "Elizabeth",
  "From being a teacher and educator, I see the state of the music through the eyes of an 18-year-old coming on to the scene, and we want to make sure it stays intact. With my generation, it's our duty to do that.": "Jason",
  "I enjoyed school - although I ran away on the first day. I'd reminded the teacher that it was nearly time for 'Watch With Mother' on TV.": "Paul",
  "When I was in graduate school, I had a teacher who said to me, 'Women writers should marry somebody who thinks writing is cute. Because if they really realised what writing was, they would run a mile.'": "Lorrie",
  "Ensuring all kids have access to an effective, talented teacher needs to be a national priority.": "Michael",
  "When I went to college, my goal was to be a college history teacher. I majored in history.": "George",
  "The Gates Foundation has learned that two questions can predict how much kids learn: 'Does your teacher use class time well?' and, 'When you're confused, does your teacher help you get straightened out?'": "Bill",
  "I can't tell you how many people say they were turned off from science because of a science teacher that completely sucked out all the inspiration and enthusiasm they had for the course.": "Neil",
  "I wonder if liberal kids call liberal talk shows and ask how to get along in a conservative teacher's class? No. No. It doesn't happen, 'cause there's no thought of getting along.": "Rush",
  "We are all busy. It's easy to find excuses for not reaching out to others, but I imagine they will sound as hollow to our Heavenly Father as the elementary school boy who gave his teacher a note asking that he be excused from school March 30th through the 34th.": "Joseph",
  "Jesus Christ is infinitely more than a great teacher and philosopher.": "Joseph",
  "My teacher Tom Spanbauer, the man who got me started writing in his workshop, used to say: 'Writers write because they weren't invited to a party.' That always struck so true, and people always nod their heads when they hear that. Especially writers.": "Chuck",

  "My brother's my teacher, my mentor, and we both learnt all the acting basics from our father.": "Jeff",

  "I certainly identify with the role of mentor and, to some degree, maybe teacher. I do a lot of work with kids at the Old Vic.": "Kevin",
  "When every church becomes a school, every cathedral a university, every clergyman a teacher, and all their hearers brave and honest thinkers, then - and not until then - will the dream of poet, patriot, philanthropist and philosopher become a real and blessed truth.": "Robert",
  "When I decided that I wanted to go to college, I wanted to be a school teacher for 7th and 8th grade boys because I felt that was an important time for them. I had gone astray at that point in my life and really wanted to help keep them from making the same mistake I had made.": "Bill",
  "You can't hold me to the same standard as the president or a school teacher. I'm just a comedian. My job is like Archie Bunker.": "Tracy",
  "I got married at 19 and graduated from a commuter college in Texas that cost $50 a semester. The way I see it, I'm a janitor's daughter who became a public school teacher, a professor, and a United States Senator. America is truly a country of opportunity!": "Elizabeth",
  "My dad always told me to stand up to bullies, and Bill O'Reilly is kind of a bully, and he's the kind of kid who hits other kids on the playground. And when you hit him, he runs to the teacher and says, 'Teacher, sue him.'": "Al",
  "My daughter became a teacher right out of college.": "Al",
  "I have had a singing teacher in L.A. for many, many years just to work on my voice as an actor.": "Pierce",
  "It wasn't until sixth grade, at P.S. 168, when my teacher took us on a field trip to her house that I realized we were poor. I have no idea what my teacher's intentions were - whether she was trying to inspire us or if she actually thought visiting her Manhattan brownstone with her view of Central Park qualified as a school trip.": "Jay-Z",
  "As a child, I had a teacher who told me, 'Look, Anne, one person can't make a difference.'": "Anne",
  "I made video art for quite a long time, and I made this video covering myself in burgers and dancing to Major Lazer and doing covers of Britney Spears songs... I can't remember how I got there, but my teacher said he'd have to fail me because it had mild nudity.": "Charli",
  "I really feel like if they'd have let me just pace in the back of the classroom while the teacher was talking, I'd have done much better. I have to move. But you know, that's disruptive for the class, and as a result, there was a ripple effect of having to sit still that found its way into every aspect of my life.": "Ryan",
  "I suppose a good director is like a teacher. I think that someone like David Cronenberg was very much like a teacher, because there's an openness, but a certain set of rules of behavior, and a certain conduct expected. But there's an atmosphere that's relaxed and conducive to exploration, and that is created by someone like Cronenberg.": "Viggo",
  "I had kind of a mean piano teacher. I went to Catholic school, so it was like the typical thing you would imagine - a little kid with a white-haired teacher frowning at the fact that I didn't practice.": "Chris",

  "Last time I was in Jamaica I financed a teacher to teach in an orphanage.": "Ziggy",
  "I had a teacher who stressed for me the importance of diction in terms of... I want to be very careful about how I say this... in terms of supporting one's voice when one is singing. In other words, if you hold on to your words, your voice will pull through for you when you're singing. So be true to your vowels.": "Julie",

  "My mother was a high school arts teacher, so I was always surrounded by the arts.": "John",
  "At the age of 6, a teacher full of ambitions, who taught in the small public school of Biran, convinced my family that I should travel to Santiago de Cuba to accompany my older sister who would enter a highly prestigious convent school. Including me was a skill of that very teacher from the little school in Biran.": "Fidel",
  "Arnold Schwarzenegger cut teacher's salaries and parks and libraries rather than raise taxes for the many California millionaires and billionaires.": "Adam",

  "Believe it or not, one teacher used to call me a giant spastic for not being able to play football.": "Peter",
  "I never had to learn English, French and German because I was brought up as all three languages. I had a private French teacher before I even went to school. That helped a lot.": "Karl",
  "I'm all self-taught. I never had a teacher. Even for English, and French, and German, I hardly went to school.": "Karl",
  "I think the British people are very, very attached to the idea that the health service is free at the point of use. But there is no reason why every doctor, nurse and teacher in this country has to be employed by the state.": "George",
  "My father was a teacher and my mother also worked in the school, so the family has a background in education.": "Nick",
  "I remember, in school, writing Janet Jackson and Michael Jackson and asking them to come get me out of class. I would imagine them running down the hall and asking my teacher, 'Ms. Daniels, can we get Missy out of class? We're here to see Missy.'": "Missy",
  "The first one I remember singing on stage was 'Somewhere Out There' from 'An American Tail.' I was around 7, and my choir teacher at school asked me if I would sing it. My parents told me that I needed to move around the stage, so for the entire time I just walked back and forth from side to side while I was singing - there's videotape of it.": "Carrie",
  "In America the schools have become too permissive, the kids now are controlling the schools, the tail is wagging the dog. We've got to make a change there and get it back to where the teachers have control of the classrooms.": "Chuck",

  "Vadim was both my teacher and my husband. I placed myself entirely in his hands.": "Brigitte",

  "My older brother Joel became an art teacher my brother Rip ultimately became a television producer and singer and actor himself. ": "Billy",
  "I always have loved the Stradivarius. My teacher, Josef Gingold, he had a Stradivarius. As a treat, he would put it under my chin and let me play a few notes, and I remember that feeling of the overtones, the complexity of the sound. It's like a great wine.": "Joshua",
  "My teacher, Josef Gingold, a student of the French school, always loved the music of Saint-Saens and Henri Vieuxtemps and all the French repertoire.": "Joshua",
  "Credentials are critical if you want to do something professional. If you want to become a doctor or lawyer or teacher or professor, there is a credentialing process. But there are a lot of other things where it's not clear they're that important.": "Peter",

  "When I was in high school, I was doing all the plays. My drama teacher, Melody Duggan, was the one one who first made me do stand-up. She's the origin of the whole thing; it's all her. In high school in Denver, that was kind of the beginning of it all.": "T.",
  "When I was a teacher, I'd walk into the classroom. I stood at the board. I was the man. I directed operations. I was an intellectual and artistic and moral traffic cop, and I - and I would direct the class, most of the time.": "Frank",
  "The main thing I am interested in is my experience as a teacher.": "Frank",
  "We don't look at teachers as scholars the way they do in Europe. In Spain you're called a professor if you're a high school teacher, and they pay teachers - they pay teachers in Europe.": "Frank",
  "I became a teacher all right. I wanted to become a teacher because I had a misconception about it. I didn't know that I'd be going into - when I first became a high school teacher in New York, that I'd be going into a battle zone, and no one prepared me for that.": "Frank",
  "If I have a cause, it's the cause of the teacher.": "Frank",

  "Music when healthy, is the teacher of perfect order, and when depraved, the teacher of perfect disorder.": "John",
  "Ballet found me, I guess you could say. I was discovered by a teacher in middle school. I always danced my whole life. I never had any training, never was exposed to seeing dance, but I always had something inside of me. I would love to choreograph and dance around.": "Misty",
  "I went to a performance-art high school, and a teacher there was signing me up for open-mic nights at the comedy club. I think about it now, and I think, 'Well, that may be inappropriate,' but it was great!'": "Margaret",
  "I did imitations of anyone who came to my parents' house, and that was my identity at school - if there were ten minutes to lunch, and the teacher was done with the lesson, he'd say, 'Okay, Leo, get up there and do something.'": "Leonardo",
  "My mother was a teacher.": "Hugh",
  "Growing up in Kansas City, I was always neat, the teacher's pet, know-it-all type.": "Gretchen",

  "As an actor and as a performer, I've felt that the education system has really helped me in a lot of ways... there was always a teacher or a professor along the way that kept pushing me to the next stage.": "Jimmy",
  "I know it affected me when I saw certain actors growing up. I had a drama teacher that would take us to see plays in New York, and it was seeing James Earl Jones and Raul Julia - I mean, this guy comes from the place my mother comes from. He's doing Shakespeare right now, and it doesn't seem to matter that he has an accent.": "Jimmy",
  "You cannot be an educator or a teacher without relating to children with full insight. Their urge to imitate has been transformed into a receptivity based on a natural and uncontested relationship of authority, and you must take this into account in the broadest possible sense.": "Rudolf",
  "A lot of moms give their kids line reads. My mom wasn't put in that position because I always had an acting teacher helping with the feelings rather than how to say something.": "Kirsten",
  "For the longest time, you just sound like a broken record, but you have to be consistent when teaching kids.": "Heidi",
  "I remember my seventh-grade chemistry teacher told me I'd never amount to anything. I thought, 'Hmm. OK.' That gave me motivation to prove her wrong.": "Michael",
  "I studied with Strasberg, Elia Kazan. They raised the bar. They weren't easy to please, and they made you achieve the best you could do. That's what a teacher does: he infuses you with passion for something.": "Martin",
  "My best stuff as a teacher was always to find the problems within each individual actor, and I'll suggest things that I know that particular actor will have difficulty with.": "Martin",
  "I studied with Sandy Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. I was in the last class to study with him before he had his larynx removed, so I actually remember the sound of his voice. He was an incredible teacher.": "Mary",
  "I loved Debussy, Stravinsky, Chopin, Tchaikovsky, anything with romantic melodies, especially the nocturnes. Nietzsche was a hero, especially with 'Thus Spoke Zarathustra.' He gets a bad rap; he's very misunderstood. He's a maker of individuals, and he was a teacher of teachers.": "Joni",

  "In the case of my book, I don't think it's really the coming-out gay novel that everyone really needed, even though it was received as such. The boy is too creepy, he betrays his teacher, the only adult man with whom he's enjoyed a sexual experience, etc.": "Edmund",
  "In the fifth grade I discovered something I could do better than the other kids. One day, the teacher set up a bunch of chairs, and she had everyone run to the chairs and back while she timed us. I had the fastest time in the whole school!": "Caitlyn",

  "I was a trial lawyer. At the same time, I was a teacher. I taught about the political and social content of film for American University.

  "Back in the day for me was a great time in my life - I was in my 20s. Most people refer to their experiences in their twenties as being a highlight in their life. It's a period of time where you often develop your own way, your own sound, your own identity, and that happened with me, when I was with a great teacher - Miles Davis.": "Herbie",
  "If you're a coach, you're a teacher.": "Nick",
  "Listen to my advice; I have some experience. In a way, it is me being a teacher, which is what I wanted to be. I still feel I could go into teaching. What is teaching but passing on your knowledge to those who are at the beginning? Some people are born with that gift.": "Grace",
  "I loved gymnastics, and my gymnastics teacher said ballet was essential to help my dance routines in competitions. I only really went because my friends were going as well. It wasn't this kind of hidden love. Then, slowly, my friends stopped going and I thought, 'I like this. I am going to stay.'": "Darcey",
  "A teacher's not going to bother being tough on you for no reason it's when they're not paying you attention that you should worry. ": "Darcey",
  "Sometimes people go to a yoga class and think it's not for them, but it might just not be the right studio or teacher - try a new one!": "Payal",
  "My younger sister had kids before I did, and managed to earn a master's degree while raising them as a single parent. Now she's a brilliant second-grade teacher. I'm in awe of her ability to juggle everything and still be a great mother.": "Idina",
  "My mom was a teacher - I have the greatest respect for the profession - we need great teachers - not poor or mediocre ones.": "Condoleezza",
  "The way I look at it is that somebody in the world, no matter what your field is - teacher, violinist, football player - has to be the best. Why not me?": "J.",
  "I did a B.A. with a major in fine arts and a minor in psychology. I wanted to become a teacher or do art therapy for the elderly. But then I realised I wanted to travel instead.": "Nargis",
  "I got an old school coach who's more of a teacher than a coach.": "Andre",
  "I do readings at the public library. I just did a benefit scene night for my old acting teacher.": "Mark",
  "Doo-wop is the true music to me, man. Doo-wop was what nurtured me and grew me into who I am, and I guess even when I was in school, the teacher probably thought I had ADD or something every day, because I'd be beating on the desks, singing like the Flamingos or the Spaniels or Clyde McPhatter or somebody.": "Aaron",
  "I gleaned different style ideas over the years. In Southern California, there is a big rockabilly sub-culture. So when I would go to car shows, I would see women dressed like this. I had a teacher in high school that always had her Bette Paige bangs.": "Andra",
  "Every summer, I regret that I didn't become a college teacher. Such a sweet life! With all that vacation time! You'll never get me to believe that being a tenured professor at a good college is anything but Heaven on earth.": "Michael",
  "Effective teacher support in my mind is the same thing as effective management. Our teachers need strong management, just like anyone in any profession.": "Wendy",
  "If we freed up all the money in the certification process, think about how much more money we'd have to put into teacher salaries.": "Wendy",
  "We are working essentially to build a leadership force of folks who will, during their first two years of teaching, actually put their kids on a different trajectory - not just survive as a new teacher, but actually help close the achievement gap for their kids.": "Wendy",
  "I have long enjoyed the friendship and companionship of Republicans because I am by instinct a teacher, and I would like to teach them something.": "Woodrow",
  "The contrasts between what is spent today to educate a child in the poorest New York City neighborhoods, where teacher salaries are often even lower than the city averages, and spending levels in the wealthiest suburban areas are daunting challenges to any hope New Yorkers might retain that even semblances of fairness still prevail.": "Jonathan",
  "My dad worked for a generator company and then UC Berkeley, and my mom was as a dental hygienist and then eventually a history teacher. My uncles and aunts, all of them are elementary school teachers or scientists.": "Cary",
  "Every single substitute teacher growing up could not pronounce my name, so whenever someone pauses, I'm like, 'Oh, that's me.'": "Cary",
  "For fifteen years, I was a teacher of youth. They were years out of the fullness and bloom of my younger manhood. They were years mingled of half breathless work, of anxious self-questionings, of planning and replanning, of disillusion, or mounting wonder.": "W.",
  "My mom was always my biggest teacher, my inspiration, my role model. My mom was just the most amazing person. She was like a bon vivant in that she just lived each day to the fullest. As soon as I became a vegetarian, she became a vegetarian.": "Christie",
  "My mother, oddly enough, really wanted to pursue a career in law, but at the time, she had children and was working as a teacher.": "Kimberly",
  "Critics at their best are independent voices; people take seriously their responsibility to see as many things as they can see, put them in the widest possible perspective, educate their readers. I really do think of myself as a teacher.": "Terry",
  "I was very inspired by my mother. She was a vocal teacher and sang in a band, and my first memories of her were going out with her on the local circuit.": "Daryl",
  "My second-grade teacher went around the class and asked everybody what they were going to be when they grew up. I said, 'I want to travel the world,' and he said, 'You'll be married and pregnant by 21, just like all the girls in this room.'": "Campbell",
  "It's the way tenure works, together with dismissal protections that tenured teachers have, that no other public employee has, which makes it almost impossible to remove a grossly ineffective and incompetent teacher or, in some cases, even an abusive teacher.": "Campbell",
  "I always wanted to be a teacher or wanted to do something with food. But modeling, I just never thought I could do it myself, really, ever. I still have trouble calling myself a model. I just never thought I was tall enough or skinny enough.": "Chrissy",
  "I owe the little formal education I got to my drama teacher, Mr. Pickett, who got us to read Shakespeare, Moliere, and other classics.": "Dennis",
  "You are the mother, the father, the sister, the brother, the teacher and the guide for the soul that has been placed in your trust.": "Debbie",
  "I was raised in New York City and raised in the New York City theater world. My father was a theater director and an acting teacher, and it was not uncommon for me to have long discussions about the method and what the various different processes were to finding a character and exploring character and realizing that character.": "Vin",
  "I grew up the son of an acting teacher, so I was kind of introduced to all of these various methods early... I've never been really good at articulating how, what that process is in the way that Stanislavsky could.": "Vin",
  "If we are to negotiate the coming years safely, we may need a new kind of leadership. To put it more precisely, we need the rediscovery of an ancient kind of leadership that has rarely been given the prominence it deserves. I mean the leader as teacher.": "Jonathan",
  "I was a writer. I just wasn't a very good one. I was lucky enough to have a playwriting teacher who told me that I'd be a better actor than I would a playwright.": "Liev",
  "I remember when I was at Brandeis, Geoffrey Wolff, he was a great fiction-writing teacher. He was the writer-in-residence, and for those of us who wanted to be writers, you were so excited to be in the same hallway as him.": "Theresa",
  "I don't want to do panel games or adverts. I really like challenges. I always get roles as an art teacher or a photographer. In the future I want to play something like a mugger/assassin/pastry chef.": "Dylan",
  "A few years back, when my style was 'punk grandma,' I picked up an amazing pair of sandals - orthopaedic ones, with really thick soles. I've given them away to a friend now, because these days my look is more '1980s substitute teacher gone wild.'": "Beth",
  "What makes 'The Lorax' such a powerful fable is partly its shamelessness. It pulls no punches it wears its teacher heart on its sleeve. ": "Lydia",
  "Back in the day, I actually studied photography in Florence for a few months, and my photography teacher took away my digital camera and said, 'No, use this - it's analog and it's square.' It was a Holga camera, a very cheap $3 or $4 plastic camera. And that's what inspired 'Instagram'.": "Kevin",
  "I didn't read so much Japanese literature. Because my father was a teacher of Japanese literature, I just wanted to do something else.": "Haruki",
  "I went to the Guilford School of Music and Drama, which was affiliated with the Royal Shakespeare Company. I was lucky enough to be taught by a beautiful, wonderful teacher called Patsy Rodenberg, who works a lot with the Royal Shakespeare Company as a voice coach and technician.": "Rhys",
  "David Levi is a teacher as well as a chef, and, like most teachers, he loves to talk.": "Kate",
  "He was the editor of our paper. He created the publishing house in Hebrew. He was - I wouldn't say the 'guru' - but really he was our teacher and a most respected man. I wrote for the paper of the youth movement.": "Shimon",
  "Coach Godsey is a brilliant mind, a great teacher, and it's been fun learning from him so far.": "Brock",
  "I come from a family of educators. My sister is a college teacher. My dad is a college teacher, but first a junior high teacher.": "J.",
  "I do respond well to a director, a teacher - someone who doesn't accept mediocrity.": "J.",
  "I wanted to be an English teacher. I wanted to do it for the corduroy jackets with patches on the side. When I got to college, as I was walking across campus one day, I ripped off a little flyer for this sketch-comedy group. It ended up being one of the greatest things I've ever done.": "John",
  "I wanted to be an English teacher. I wanted to do it for the corduroy jackets with patches on the side.": "John",
  "I planned on being an English teacher, but I don't know where that went.": "John",
  "I think teaching should be an exalted profession, not a picked-on profession.": "Chuck",
  "I was going to go back to college and become a math teacher.": "Butch",
  "Research is starting to show that a child should be engaged at least 20 hours a week. I do not think it matters which program you choose as long as it keeps the child actively engaged with the therapist, teacher, or parent for at least 20 hours a week.": "Temple",
  "I had people in my life who didn't give up on me: my mother, my aunt, my science teacher. I had one-on-one speech therapy. I had a nanny who spent all day playing turn-taking games with me.": "Temple",
  "I did not study science at school until I was 13, when I was totally turned on by a seemingly dreary old teacher who suddenly, unannounced, manufactured a huge explosion in the middle of a totally boring monologue. From then on, all of his class wanted to make explosions.": "Robert",
  "Do I think it's OK to fight authority as long as you're only talking about the high school teacher? No.": "John",
  "I read very one-note. Teacher's pet, Goody Two-shoes. I'd hate to be annoying. Who wants to see movies with someone annoying in them? But it's hard for me to paint myself as anything but whatever it is I come across as - which is pretty together.": "Allison",
  "In high school, I did some musicals, but I never took acting until college. I was studying opera, classical voice, and a speech teacher asked me to audition for this play, and I got the lead.": "Forest",
  "I'd have to say I'm most proud of my mentoring camp that I do in Dallas every year for one hundred boys from single-parent homes. I was raised by a mother who was a Sunday school teacher and a father who worked hard. Together they taught me to give back.": "Steve",
  "I failed eighth grade twice, and then they moved me up to ninth grade. Then I failed that and dropped out. My teacher would hand me a test, and I'd grade it myself with an F, then put my head down on the desk.": "Tig",
  "I'm a craftsman type of teacher. I don't like the thematic type of teaching that takes place in a lot of colleges.": "Ethan",
  "My mother's not a political person. She just doesn't want me to be mean... sometimes I have to be mean. It's like a parent or a teacher. Sometimes for the good of everybody you have to be a little bit strong, a little bit confrontational.": "Bill",
  "You know, if you're a human and living on the planet, it doesn't matter what you do; you are not immune to the challenges, the trials, the difficulty. And that fact that I happen to be a coach and a minister and a spiritual teacher doesn't mean anything. I'm still human.": "Iyanla",
  "I think once you're in the public eye, whether you're a boss, a teacher or whatever you do, that you're automatically in the position of role model. You have people looking up to you, so whether you choose to accept it or not is a different question.": "Talib",
  "My father was a trained accountant, a BCom from Sydenham College and a self-taught violinist. In the 1920s, when he was in his teens, he heard a great violinist, Jascha Heifetz, and he was so inspired listening to him that he bought himself a violin, and with a little help from an Italian teacher, he learned to play it.": "Zubin",
  "I've never studied the classics, but I'd like to. My teacher offered to show me how the Greeks were able to sculpt someone perfectly. From there, you can go off and experiment - sort of like jazz. Once you learn to play anything, you can break the form and go and do something even bigger.": "Channing",
  "Many of us have been touched by the magic of a great teacher. I know I have.": "Bruce",
  "My first memory in the world is my gym teacher ripping my mother's necklace off her neck and throwing it out the window and her running downstairs to go after it. I have no memory before that. I was 4. My father had a lot of girlfriends and my mother had a lot of boyfriends.": "Mike",
  "There were some summers when every boy in Ayrshire seemed to be playing golf, and my dad taught me. But he was a terrible teacher - of everything. Learning to drive with him almost killed me. He was the world's most impatient man - awful short fuse.": "John",
  "I grew up in a house with a mother who was a teacher and a Freedom Rider - very left-wing Democrats living in a heterogeneous working-class neighborhood. I picked up a lot of those values there, and I brought them with me when I showed up in Hollywood.": "Ben",
  "I could never have pictured myself writing a book when I was 25 years old. My mom was an English teacher but I wasn't that way growing up.": "Tony",
  "One day, I just wandered into a dance class full of girls, and that was it. I thought, 'Hang on! I'll have a bit of this.' I went back a week later and got dragged up by the teacher. It wasn't a massive calling.": "Anton",
  "My old dance teacher, Jimmy Wilde, a former European ballroom dancing champion, was so sophisticated.": "Anton",
  "Students never think it can be the teacher's fault and so I thought I was stupid. I was frustrated and would come home and cry because I couldn't do it. Then we got a new teacher who made math accessible. That made all the difference and I learned that it's how you present it that makes it scary or friendly.": "Danica",
  "I was going to be a teacher. I was applying to graduate school when I got the call to do 'Same Love,' actually. I was gonna go to Boston University for my masters in teaching.": "Mary",
  "I had a teacher senior year in high school. He was a theater teacher, and he basically was a little bit like 'High School Musical.' He kind of encouraged the jocks to get involved with the plays. I did it as kind of a senior year lark.": "D.",
  "At school, I'd refuse to take part in biology lessons when animals were being dissected. One time, the teacher announced that we would be gassing worms. So I ran around the room, gathered up all the worms and set them free in the fields. I just loved animals and couldn't bear the thought of them suffering.": "Imelda",
  "I do remember a teacher telling me when I was about ten that I was really good at acting. I was so proud, even though I am sure he said that to all of us in the class.": "Nikolaj",
  "I was used to theatre classes. I studied with my mother; she was a theatre teacher and directed, too, so it was very family-like. Then I studied with a great teacher in Paris, and she was wonderful; she pushed me, but she was a warm soul.": "Juliette",
  "In Philly, there are a lot of social programs. If you have a degree, you can go and apply. I was basically a social worker, but I became sort of a sub teacher in a special program, helping kids with reading or math. But we would also do plays, learn about music... We were doing lots of fun stuff, but that was such hard work.": "Diplo",
  "About 13-14 years ago, I went back to my alma mater, Fairfax High School, and ran into the music teacher. She invited me to come speak to the kids about the viability of a music career. When I went into the room where I used to play every day in a big orchestra, they had nothing!": "Flea",
  "The very rough story is this: Melbourne boy, out of both my parents' houses at a young age, lived with my grandmother, drama teacher twisted me into doing this TV thing that I thought my mates were doing, too.": "Ben",
  "I adore children. If I weren't an actor, I would be a teacher or work with small children in some way. I feel happy in their company.": "David",
  "I grew up around books - my grandmother's house, where I lived as a small child, was full of books. My father was a history teacher, and he loved the Russian novels. There were always books around.": "John",
  "In March 1943, my parents, four-year-old sister and I were interned with other foreign civilians at Lunghua camp, a former teacher training college outside Shanghai, where we remained until the end of August 1945.": "J.",
  "I'm into books - I love literature, so I toyed with the idea of being an English teacher. I had a fantastic English teacher at school. I think great English teachers make the world go round.": "Taron",
  "I have always admired teachers because teaching, like the priesthood, medicine and writing, is a vocation. You don't become a teacher because you want wealth. It is the same with writing.": "F.",
  "Tragedy is a hell of a teacher. It's much too strict, but it's a hell of a teacher.": "Harlan",
  "School district policies and practices have not kept pace with student and teacher needs.": "Eli",
  "My father was a swim teacher. We used to swim before school, swim after school.": "Gordon",
  "I kind of fell backwards into acting. I was studying to be a high school teacher. I look now and I understand completely, or actually barely, how much work it is to be a teacher. It's an incredible amount of work.": "Nathan",
  "I was attending the University of Alberta. I was going to be a high school teacher, like my parents. I failed - no, I didn't fail a class, I just barely passed. I really didn't try. It was Canadian history, through the plays of the time. My God, those were boring plays.": "Nathan",
  "My art teacher in junior high was a very out gay man and a mentor to me.": "Gus",
  "In about 9th grade, an English teacher told me I had a talent to act. He said I should audition for a performing arts high school, so I did on a whim. I got accepted. Then I got accepted at the Julliard School, and by then, I was serious about it.": "Ving",
  "Kathy Dewar, my high-school English teacher, introduced me to journalism. From the moment I wrote my first article for the student paper, I convinced myself that having my name in print - writing in English, interviewing Americans - validated my presence here.": "Jose",
  "Mitch Glazer and I went to high school together, and his mother was my English teacher for two years. She was my favorite teacher, and I followed Mitch's career as a journalist, so we've kind of kept in touch over the years.": "Mickey",
  "Before I was ever a baker, I was a teacher. Or, at least, that is what I thought I was going to be. After O-levels, I went to art school in Wallasey on the Wirral, and my mate Cavan and I did a teacher training course.": "Paul",
  "I've been reading Greek mythology since I was a kid. I also taught it when I was a sixth grade teacher, so I knew a lot of mythological monsters already. Sometimes I still use books and Web sites to research, though. Every time I research Greek mythology, I learn something new!": "Rick",
  "As a teacher, I've never seen anything like 'Harry Potter.' That's why I smart when people talk about the 'next' 'Harry Potter.' There is no 'next' 'Harry Potter.'": "Rick",
  "I tend to think of a myth and then explore how it would play out if it were happening in the modern-day world. I modify all the myths I use, but I stick very closely to their structure - it is the hidden teacher in me.": "Rick",
  "I did things like get in a cupboard before the teacher came in at the beginning of a lesson, and then, two minutes before the end of the class, I come out of the cupboard and go, 'Sorry I'm late.'": "Miranda",
  "About me - I used to want to be a P.E. teacher, and kind of still do.": "Miranda",
  "I went to school at the San Francisco Art Institute, thinking I was going to become an art teacher. Within the first six months I was there, I was told that I couldn't be an art teacher unless I became an artist first.": "Annie",
  "I was a good novice teacher, but I did the things that were obvious. I stayed for lunch for extra tutoring, gave kids my cell phone, and was available. In my first year of teaching, I ended up doubling the math time that a conventional school would have. But I don't think any of these things were path-breaking or unusual.": "Angela",
  "I worked hard when I was a consultant. I worked hard when I was in graduate school looking at neuroscience. I worked hard as a teacher. But those are completely different career paths. And the lack of direction is why I didn't get far enough in any of those things.": "Angela",
  "When people think of the word 'drive,' they often think you have it or you don't, and that's where we're wrong. Drive is something that can be encouraged by a wonderful teacher, by a terrific classroom environment, by an awesome soccer team that you are on, and it can be squashed as well.": "Angela",
  "I call myself a meditation teacher rather than a spiritual teacher.": "Sharon",
  "I've spent quite a bit of my life as a meditation teacher and writer commending the strengths of love and compassion.": "Sharon",
  "My job requires me to put on a little dress and run around the streets of New York in heels. But I also had the financial means to hire a yoga teacher to come to my house while my sitter watched the newborn. For 95 percent of the world, that's not realistic.": "Sarah",
  "Knowing what to expect from a teacher is a really good thing, of course: It lets you get the right answers more quickly than you would otherwise.": "Alison",
  "A retired teacher paid $62,000 towards her pension and nothing, yes nothing, for full family medical, dental and vision coverage over her entire career. What will we pay her? $1.4 million in pension benefits and another $215,000 in health care benefit premiums over her lifetime.": "Chris",
  "I'm a conservative, pro-life governor in a state where it is really tough to be both. A state like New Jersey, with lots of Democrats, but still we cut taxes, we balanced budgets. We fought the teacher's union.": "Chris",
  "The drama teacher that I had in high school, back in Texas, was the only teacher who didn't kick me out of his class. He turned me on to 'The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan.' I had picked up Dylan with 'Bringing It All Back Home,' and he turned me on to the first couple of albums, which I hadn't heard.": "Steve",
  "It's every teacher's job to be rigorous about constantly being open to new ideas and innovation.": "Brandon",
  "I was a mimic when I was a child. I mimicked the teacher and made friends that way, actually. That was a very subversive activity, because I was a goody-goody who never got in trouble. But if I went off in the corner and mimicked the teacher, people loved it.": "Anna",
  "Being a mother has been my greatest teacher and also the most self-sacrificing thing I've ever done.": "Katey",
  "Please stop teaching my children that everyone gets a trophy just for participating. What is this, the Nobel Prize? Not everybody gets a trophy.": "Glenn",
  "I'm home schooled, and I have a teacher that goes with me on all my movies.": "Dakota",
  "I spent ridiculous amounts of time as an activist and volunteer and was a teacher for 20 years.": "Johann",
  "I do believe that when your child does poorly on a test, your first step should not necessarily be to attack the teacher or the school's curriculum. It should be to look at the idea that, maybe, the child didn't work hard enough.": "Amy",
  "Oh, stuff the critics. I don't care. Too many people are snooty about classical. Look, I wasn't brought up in a home where we listened to classical music. It was a singing teacher that thought it would be best for my voice. Then I moved into crossover. And if that makes the music accessible to more people, then great.": "Katherine",
  "I wanted to write at school - to write funny stories which the teacher might ask me to read out to the class. It's all basically about showing off.": "Mark",
  "I'm blessed with a good pair of ears. That's how I fooled my piano teacher. I'd watch his fingers and I'd listen to it, and I just kind of basically learned it by myself.": "Eddie",
  "I read a lot of comic books and any kind of thing I could find. One day, a teacher found me. She grabbed my comic book and tore it up. I was really upset, but then she brought in a pile of books from her own library. That was the best thing that ever happened to me.": "Walter",
  "I had always been fascinated with Napoleon because he was a self-made emperor; Victor Hugo said, 'Napoleon's will to power,' and it was the title of my paper. And I submitted it to my teacher, and he didn't think I had written it. And he wanted me to explain it to him.": "August",
  "I tried writing fiction as a little kid, but had a teacher humiliate me, so didn't write again until I was a senior in college.": "Janet",
  "I can remember exactly where I sat when my teacher first read Roald Dahl's 'James and the Giant Peach'.": "Dave",
  "My grandma was so old-fashioned. She thought we were supposed to have homework every night. I would come home, and she would be like, 'Where's your homework?' and I'd be like, 'I don't have none.' She'd be like, 'I'ma call your teacher.'": "Bryson",
  "A Latin teacher told me I might make a good actress, and that stuck in my memory. I did some modeling, and Polanski gave me that small part.": "Jacqueline",
  "I was never any good in the school theatrical productions. I always got a role like the March Hare. A Latin teacher told me I might make a good actress, and that stuck in my memory.": "Jacqueline",
  "It was in the early 1960s that my late revered teacher, Professor Abraham Joshua Heschel, became the first major Jewish theologian in America to enter into dialogue with Christian theologians on a high theological level.": "David",
  "Remember when you were in school and the teacher would put a picture under an overhead projector so you could see it on the wall? God, I loved that. Tellya the truth, I used to look at that beam of light and think it was God.": "Lynda",
  "I'm a freak, everything has to be totally flat when I play. Ed Will, my jazz teacher, set up everything completely flat, and then you'd tilt your snare drum away from you, so I do that too. So my snare tilts away from me.": "Travis",
  "I'm like a really goofy home ec teacher.": "Alton",
  "I'm not a prophet. I'm not a teacher. I have no degrees. My degree is from the University of Life.": "Jamie",
  "I wanted to be a Teacher with a big T: teach the whole planet. It led me into writing and speaking to large groups.": "Jack",
  "Parents can shape a child, but a great teacher can, too.": "Susanne"
