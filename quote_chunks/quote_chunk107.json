  "To make others less happy is a crime. To make ourselves unhappy is where all crime starts. We must try to contribute joy to the world. That is true no matter what our problems, our health, our circumstances. We must try. I didn't always know this, and am happy I lived long enough to find it out.": "Roger",

  "Investing in health will produce enormous benefits.": "Gro",
  "There isn't anybody out there who doesn't have a mental health issue, whether it's depression, anxiety, or how to cope with relationships. Having OCD is not an embarrassment anymore - for me. Just know that there is help and your life could be better if you go out and seek the help.": "Howie",

  "I think the healthy way to live is to make friends with the beast inside oneself, and that means not the beast but the shadow. The dark side of one's nature. Have fun with it and you know, is to accept everything about ourselves.": "Anthony",

  "Most Christian 'believers' tend to echo the cultural prejudices and worldviews of the dominant group in their country, with only a minority revealing any real transformation of attitudes or consciousness. It has been true of slavery and racism, classism and consumerism and issues of immigration and health care for the poor.": "Richard",

  "In the midst of these hard times it is our good health and good sleep that are enjoyable.": "Knute",

  "Exuberant health is always, as such, sickness also.": "Theodor",

  "It's about businesses nervous about taking on school leavers because of a mass of red tape. It's about health and safety regulations and green fines.": "Nigel",

  "We have to see that we're a part of each other, and we have to take care of each other. The reason why they have universal health care in Canada and Britain, these other places? Because they believe if one suffers, everybody suffers.": "Michael",

  "As an athlete, I understood the value of my health insurance. I knew that in my profession, injuries were common and could happen at any time.": "Magic",
  "Midwives and doctors play a crucial role preventing unnecessary maternal deaths. They educate women about nutrition, health and family planning. And they step in when complications arise.": "Liya",
  "Government is a health hazard. Governments have killed many more people than cigarettes or unbuckled seat belts ever have.": "P.",
  "The more you look into health and health inequalities, you realize that a lot of it is not due to a particular disease - it's really linked to underlying societal issues such as poverty, inequity, lack of access to safe drinking water and housing. And these are all the things we focus on at CARE.": "Helene",
  "Connectivity enables transparency for better government, education, and health.": "Bill",

  "I'm no health care expert, but you've got technology that constantly advances the ability to extend life and maybe improve lifestyle. That puts constant upward pressure on health care costs.": "Steven",

  "There are fewer people living in tents, more people with access to quality health care, more kids who are in school, and for the first time in a long, long time, Haiti is attracting private sector investments.": "Cheryl",
  "I believe our health care system is in drastic need of innovative, patient-centered reforms that encourage competition and increase consumer choice, not the bloated bureaucracy, tax increases, rationing, and mandates in the president's government takeover.": "Tim",
  "It has had a tremendous impact on my life, more than on the life of most Prize winners, because I was in an unusual situation. I was unemployed at the time. I was in good health, but I had reached the age of 66 and beginning to get social security, but I didn't have much of that. I had many years of unemployment before me.": "John",
  "We need to do everything we can to protect the health and welfare of children around the world, but fortunately, it's getting easier to provide things like medication and care.": "Alek",
  "We have all these politicians that claim they're pro-life and that say women should not be able to get abortions and all this other stuff... there's nothing more pro-life than helping a woman who wants to have a child have a child. Then I realized that health insurance doesn't cover IVF.": "Remy",
  "I also rise today in strong support of forward movement on the implementation of health information technology, which has the potential to save the United States billions of dollars in health care costs each year.": "Russ",
  "I believe in universal health care. And I am not afraid to say so.": "Stephen",
  "Unfortunately, we force people to break the law in order to get any kind of mental health treatment.": "Pete",
  "Every single dollar spent lobbying a legislator on behalf of oil and gas is a toxic dollar that undermines public health and safety laws that protect Americans. That's contamination of the political system.": "Josh",
  "I'm a health nut, but when I eat, I go hard. I'm a Buffalo wing magnet, a sandwich fanatic, a cheesesteak guy. But I'll only get a cheesesteak in Philadelphia. No one else does it right.": "Kevin",

  "View health as an investment, not an expense.": "John",

  "The early pioneers of both wellness and network marketing were motivated by the sense that it was possible to create a better life than the conventional routes offered - better personal health and better economic health, respectively. Now the 'alternatives' of yesterday have become the economic powerhouses of today and tomorrow.": "Paul",
  "I've never made a penny being a doctor, so that makes it not a job. My sense of a doctor is that one is a presence caring for health. So I'm never not a doctor. People call me from all over the world who are hurting, and I care for them. Chatting is what more people want than anything.": "Patch",
  "There's an opportunity for the pharmacist to play a much greater role in health care, especially with what we have going on in this country with the shortage of primary-care physicians.": "Gregory",
  "I did not become a vegetarian for my health, I did it for the health of the chickens.": "Isaac",
  "Poverty is multidimensional. It extends beyond money incomes to education, health care, political participation and advancement of one's own culture and social organisation.": "Atal",
  "Obamacare is not about improved health care or cheaper insurance or better treatment or insuring the uninsured, and it never has been about that. It's about statism. It's about expanding the government. It's about control over the population. It is about everything but health care.": "Rush",

  "There's a need for accepting responsibility - for a person's life and making choices that are not just ones for immediate short-term comfort. You need to make an investment, and the investment is in health and education.": "Buzz",

  "Issues relating to global health and sustainability must stay high on the agenda if we are to cope with an ageing and ever-increasing population, with growing pressure on resources, and with rising global temperatures. The risks and dangers need to be assessed and then confronted.": "Martin",
  "Many kids come out of college, they have a credit card and a diploma. They don't know how to buy a house or a car or health insurance or life insurance. They do not know basic microeconomics.": "Jesse",
  "A dark house is always an unhealthy house, always an ill-aired house, always a dirty house. Want of light stops growth and promotes scrofula, rickets, etc., among the children. People lose their health in a dark house, and if they get ill, they cannot get well again in it.": "Florence",
  "Vaccines are the tugboats of preventive health.": "William",

  "In the case of maternal health care, you look at, well naturally, it's the mother who's the customer, who makes the decisions. But in truth, the mother in many areas, in certain parts of India, the mother has very little decision-making power at all. The real decision-maker is the mother-in-law.": "Jacqueline",
  "Natural gas obviously brings with it a number of quality-of-life environmental benefits because it is a relatively clean-burning fuel. It has a CO2 footprint, but it has no particulates. It has none of the other emissions elements that are of concern to public health that other forms of power-generation fuels do have: coal, fuel oil, others.": "Rex",
  "You can't just take an aspirin and sit around and have 12 donuts and think, 'I took my aspirin so I'm not going to have a heart attack.' It's really important each person take personal responsibility for their health. You can't keep thinking that someone else is going to take care of it. You have to be part of the solution.": "Corbin",
  "The defeat of Obamacare will come from the realization that the very idea of a government-administered health care system is absurd... and by people opting out of the system and developing workarounds.": "Rand",

  "The winners in life treat their body as if it were a magnificent spacecraft that gives them the finest transportation and endurance for their lives.": "Denis",

  "Around New York City, samples collected at dozens of beaches or piers have detected the types of bacteria and other pollutants tied to sewage overflows. Though the city's drinking water comes from upstate reservoirs, environmentalists say untreated excrement and other waste in the city's waterways pose serious health risks.": "Charles",
  "I just have to be very clear. Whether or not I lose weight or stay the same, it's purely a choice of mine for health. Not because I think that plus size, curvy, voluptuous, big bodies aren't attractive - because I think they're awesome and sexy.": "Chrissy",
  "General Motors spends more on health care than steel.": "Kathleen",
  "Health care is one-sixth of our economy. If the government can control that, they can control just about everything. We need to understand what is going on, because there are much more economic models that can be used to give us good health care than what we have now.": "Ben",

  "Health is relative. There is no such thing as an absolute state of health or sickness. Everyone's physical, mental, and emotional condition is a combination of both.": "Theodore",
  "People's genes can say a great deal about their health. There are genes that reveal an increased likelihood of getting cancer, heart disease or Alzheimer's.": "Adam",
  "The only trouble here is they won't let us study enough. They are so afraid we shall break down and you know the reputation of the College is at stake, for the question is, can girls get a college degree without ruining their health?": "Ellen",
  "I think it's horrible that people have to be told. Don't smoke! Everybody knows it's bad for the health. But they have to forbid it.": "Karl",

  "The problem with the stigma around mental health is really about the stories that we tell ourselves as a society. What is normal? That's just a story that we tell ourselves.": "Matthew",
  "I do all I can to maintain good health. I eat mostly plants, as Michael Pollan would say. I get a lot of exercise. I lead a purposeful daily life. I stay current with the dentist.

  "Every time you have a carrot instead of a cookie, every time you go to the gym instead of going to the movies, that's a costly investment in your health.

  "Water and sanitation has not had the same kind of champion that global health, and even education, have had.": "Jim",
  "Antibiotics are a very serious public health problem for us, and it's getting worse. Resistant microbes outstrip new antibiotics. It's an ongoing problem. It's not like we can fix it, and it's over. We have to fight continued resistance with a continual pipeline of new antibiotics and continue with the perpetual challenge.": "Anthony",
  "The Democratic Party believes that health insurance is a social responsibility of the nation. I believe that health insurance is an individual responsibility. And that's a really hard philosophy to mesh.": "Raul",
  "'Everything To Me' is about everything that's important. It's about my wife, my kids, it's about life, about being happy.

  "Buildings designed with careful attention to aesthetics arouse and enlighten their occupants and that promotes their good health.": "Robert",

  "Texas is a great place to be rich and a terrible place to be poor. It's got the highest percentage of people without health insurance in the country. If you get injured on the job, good luck getting workers' comp. And God help you if you're poor and mentally ill.": "Gail",
  "Legally speaking, the term 'public rights' is as vague and indefinite as are the terms 'public health,' 'public good,' 'public welfare,' and the like. It has no legal meaning, except when used to describe the separate, private, individual rights of a greater or less number of individuals.": "Lysander",

  "Nearly every business collects metrics on inventory, sales, and workplace process. Health care has been slow to measure these kinds of outcomes. Increasingly, general medicine, via either managed care or large practice settings, is improving by collecting data through electronic records and refining practice based on what works.": "Thomas",

  "If we do nothing, as the Republicans suggest, we're going to see health care costs reach a point where small businesses can't afford it and families can't afford it.

  "We will have health care reform in America.": "Dick",

  "In order to lead a country or a company, you've got to get everybody on the same page and you've got to be able to have a vision of where you're going. America can't have a vision of health care for everybody, green economy, regulations - can't have a bunch of piece-meal activities. It's got to have a vision.": "Jack",
  "President Obama is also standing up for women in North Carolina and across our country.

  "One of the jewels in the crown of Labour's time in office was the rescue of the National Health Service.

  "Health care costs are eating the Defense Department alive.": "Robert",
  "Decades ago, women suffered through horrifying back-alley abortions. Or, they used dangerous methods when they had no other recourse.

  "Gut health is the key to overall health.": "Kris",
  "I've always had good energy I've always had good health. ": "Dick",

  "Cost is the spectre haunting health reform. For many decades, the great flaw in the American health-care system was its unconscionable gaps in coverage.": "Atul",
  "If our hearts are ready for anything, we can open to our inevitable losses, and to the depths of our sorrow. We can grieve our lost loves, our lost youth, our lost health, our lost capacities. This is part of our humanness, part of the expression of our love for life.": "Tara",
  "Unfortunately, the mechanism for doing philanthropy in a structured way isn't yet in place in India. I already do a fair bit and support various causes such as education, sanitation, health. But selling costly drugs at affordable prices is philanthropy in itself.": "Yusuf",
  "Redemption basically is about holistic health, if you want to translate it into modern parlance. What I suggest - based on the Christian tradition but not often preached - is that you can't enter into the fullness of the Pascal mystery of the redemption unless there is a radical transformation of motivation within you.": "Thomas",
  "I've spent half my life in gyms, if not more, and I love physical fitness and health; couple that with the fact that I love for people to be healthy, whether it's mentally, physically, or emotionally, and it's just a great opportunity for me to do something I love and have an impact on people's health.": "Steve",

  "Your health is your starting point - without it, you have nothing.": "Sienna",
  "It's not okay to be fat - not because of the way you look, but because it's unhealthy. I have experienced hormonal problems, bad skin, immense laziness, and back and knee pain. It's not fine to be too fat or too thin! Anything in extremes is wrong. I am afraid of putting on weight because I don't want to develop health problems.": "Sonam",
  "Because sanitation has so many effects across all aspects of development - it affects education, it affects health, it affects maternal mortality and infant mortality, it affects labor - it's all these things, so it becomes a political football. Nobody has full responsibility.": "Rose",
  "If workers are more insecure, that's very 'healthy' for the society, because if workers are insecure, they won't ask for wages, they won't go on strike, they won't call for benefits; they'll serve the masters gladly and passively. And that's optimal for corporations' economic health.": "Noam",
  "When 'Men's Health' reached out and said, 'Will you be on the 'Today Show' and do a fitness challenge?' I said, 'OK. I'm not showing them anything they don't already know.' But I'm going to take what some would argue is a negative or not substantive and turn it into a substantive thing to hopefully do some good for people.": "Aaron",

  "When I go to my health club, and it's in the basement, you have to take the elevator down. And this drives me crazy. Why can't there be a stairway? At least make it as easy to exercise as it is to not exercise. It's in society's interest for me to take the stairs.": "Malcolm",
  "Drinking water that does not meet a federal health guideline will not necessarily make someone ill. Many contaminants are hazardous only if consumed for years. And some researchers argue that even toxic chemicals, when consumed at extremely low doses over long periods, pose few risks.": "Charles",

Character skills are equally important determinants of wages, education, health and many other significant aspects of flourishing lives.": "James",

The Chinese, although among the poorest peoples of the world, have brought their fertility rate down to 2.4, partly by social coercion, but mostly by broadly available education, health care and family planning.": "Donella",
  "All Democrats are not entitlement people. These are the people who are going to suffer the cost of Obama health care. These are the people who are suffering because there're no jobs.": "Carl",
  "Policy is no longer being written by politicians accountable to the American public. Instead, policies concerning the defense budget, deregulation, health care, public transportation, job training programs, and a host of other crucial areas are now largely written by lobbyists who represent mega corporations.": "Henry",
  "We could try freedom for a while. We had it for a long time. That's where you sell something, and I agree to buy it because I like it. That is how we operate in most of rest of the marketplace other than health care.": "Rand",
  "You go into the book store, there's the cut-out of Dr. Phil, and then the dreaded women's health section where every book, instead of the menopause book with the fanged Medusa head on the cover that might be more pertinent, you always see a flower and a poppy and a daisy and a stethoscope.": "Sandra",
  "There is simply not enough money available to support a system in which the lion's share of expenditures is devoted to acute care, with virtually nothing being spent on preventive medicine, i.e. health care.": "Joel",
  "I've always been interested in public health approaches because it seems to me we have this yearning for silver bullets, and that is not in fact how change comes about. Change comes through silver buckshot - a lot of little things that achieve results. That's a classic public health approach.": "Nicholas",

  "Research shows that when women are empowered as political leaders, countries often experience higher standards of living with positive developments in education, infrastructure, and health care.": "Miriam",

  "What good is telling America's children that they will have equal opportunity for education if they don't have the skills that will even get them to the point of benefiting from education, because they didn't have the child care, the health care that would enable them to grow as strong and constructive human beings?": "Janet",

  "I loved growing up in Canada. It's a great place to grow up because - well, at least where I grew up - it's very multicultural. There's also good health care and a good education system.": "Ryan",
  "I know every fight could be my last fight, and if that happens, that's not just a health issue, but I'll be knocked off that king's stool.": "Anthony",
  "Abortion is not health care. A woman has a right to her body, but that is not her body. What about the baby?": "Alveda",
  "I think that addiction is a very, very important thing that has to be treated, but has to be treated as a health problem and not as a police problem.": "Wagner",

  "I know that there are millions of Americans who are content with their health care coverage - they like their plan and, most importantly, they value their relationship with their doctor.": "Barack",

  "The truth is, in order to get things like universal health care and a revamped education system, then someone is going to have to give up a piece of their pie so that someone else can have more.": "Michelle",
  "My employees, there's no deductible in your health care. No deductible, absolutely not. You get paid sick days, as many as you need, personal days.": "Michael",
  "The American public believes that health care is a right and not a commodity.": "Michael",
  "If I were a capitalist I would not give my employees health insurance with no deductible, which I do, including dental, and paid pregnancy leave. That's not called capitalism, that's called being a Christian and someone who believes in democracy, so that everyone should get a fair slice of the pie.": "Michael",
  "The health insurance industry does not like to pay out claims, because they don't make money. The only way they can make a profit is if they don't pay for your operation. If they pay for your operation and your doctor's appointment and your pharmaceuticals, they don't make any money.": "Michael",
  "I purposely don't talk about money, because people are already skeptical about TV preachers. But I do say that I want you to be blessed. To me, prosperity is having health, having great children, having peace, good relationships. It's not about the money.": "Joel",

  "As a single-payer advocate, I believe that at the end of the day, if a state goes forward and passed an effective single-payer program, it will demonstrate that you can provide quality health care to every man, woman and child in a more cost-effective way.": "Bernie",
  "If the goal of health-care reform is to provide comprehensive, universal health care in a cost-effective way, the only honest approach is a single-payer approach.": "Bernie",
  "It has become clear that the function of a private health insurance is to make as much money as possible. Every dollar not paid out in claims is another dollar made in profits for the company.": "Bernie",
  "First of all, we have seen now in six years of Obamacare that it has been a disaster. It is the biggest job-killer in this country. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs, have been forced into part-time work, have lost their health insurance, have lost their doctors, have seen their premiums skyrocket.": "Ted",
  "The single best thing we can do is expand competition. Let people purchase health insurance across state lines. If you want to expand access, what you want to do is increase choices and drive down cost.": "Ted",
  "I was being hated for about 40 or 50 years by the whole world, but it did not destroy me, and it did not ruin my health. And the reason is because I just did not answer them. I had my own life.": "Yoko",

  "One of the best aspects of health care reform is it starts to emphasize prevention.": "Anne",
  "Many companies today are reducing hours of full-time people to get under the minimum so they don't have to pay health care costs. I just shake my head because that's not going to build long-term value and trust with your people.": "Howard",
  "Once upon a time, the homemaker was just Mom, but now we've evolved and come to a place where we're celebrating grandmas, grandpas, moms, dads - all the people that keep it safe and clean for our kids - and the overall health for ourselves so we can continue to function and do the variety of things we all do.": "Christina",
  "Obamacare has made the government part of our health care decisions. The IRS controls all of our financial information. The NSA apparently sees everything else.": "Ben",
  "The Dallas model, prominent in the South and Southwest, sees a growing population as a sign of urban health. Cities liberally permit housing construction to accommodate new residents. The Los Angeles model, common on the West Coast and in the Northeast Corridor, discourages growth by limiting new housing.": "Virginia",

  "America's health care system is the most complicated and expensive in the world.": "Christy",
  "Health consists with temperance alone.": "Alexander",
  "After doing a juice cleanse, I'm motivated to eat healthier and not emotionally. Cleansing is like my meditation. It makes me stop, focus and think about what I'm putting into my body. I'm making a commitment to my health and hitting the reset button.": "Salma",
  "The idea that there is one kind of African is, of course, ridiculous. Sometimes African entrepreneurs want to kill you because you are saying public health is the priority, not roads. Of course they are right to press for that issue, but so are we right, I believe, to argue, for example, that millions of children could and should be vaccinated.": "Bono",
  "Alas, bacon and eggs are not health foods.": "Dean",
  "It's clear that policymakers and economists are going to be interested in the measurement of well-being primarily as it correlates with health they also want to know whether researchers can validate subjective responses with physiological indices. ": "Daniel",

  "When President Barack Obama is trying to persuade Americans not to do something, he has a go-to line: 'That's not who we are.' Whether the issue involves discrimination, immigration, torture, criminal violence or health care, he invokes the nation's very identity.": "Cass",

  "It's important to wallow and grieve when you have a health issue. I don't think you really get the best stuff out of life until you've had the worst stuff.": "Natalie",
  "I do have to take care of myself, not only because I'm in the movies, just for mental health reasons. I exercise for me. You know, maybe it would be nice to not have to do that in order to feel good, but I do. I feel like I have to, to feel good. To clear my head and all of that, so.": "Annette",
  "Cycling is good for people in all ways: their health, their well-being, and it does no damage to the environment. It can, however, be dangerous, and this has to be addressed.": "Jeremy",
  "America's men and women in uniform bravely defend our nation and our values. Their skill, dedication, and valor are the envy of the world.

  "Satellites record data in different parts of the light spectrum that we can't see.

  "As a physician specializing in nutrition, my priority is to the health of the public.": "Michael",

  "When I became president with a commitment to reform health care, Hillary was a natural to head the health care task force. You all know we failed because we couldn't break a Senate filibuster. Hillary immediately went to work on solving the problems the bill sought to address one by one.": "William",
  "In 1979, just after I became governor, I asked Hillary to chair a rural health committee to help expand health care to isolated farm and mountain areas. They recommended to do that partly by deploying trained nurse practitioners in places with no doctors to provide primary care they were trained to provide.": "William",
  "No one wants to fail. So most of us don't even try. Sad. We don't even take that first step to improve our health or to deepen our working relationships or to realize a dream.": "Robin",

  "We control health and pathogenicity by complex multi-speciated relationships through symbiosis and synergy. Portable shelters for livestock, along with electric fencing, insure hygienic and sanitary housing and lounging areas, not to mention clean air, sunshine, and exercise.": "Joel",
  "As women slowly gain power, their values and priorities are reshaping the agenda. A multitude of studies show that when women control the family funds, they generally spend more on health, nutrition, and education - and less on alcohol and cigarettes.": "Dee",
  "Our message of ensuring every Hoosier has access to a quality education that turns into a good paying job, that ultimately leads to a meaningful career with access to affordable health care, is resonating.": "Todd",
  "The root cause of the looming energy problem - and the key to easing environmental, economic and religious tensions while improving public health - is to address the unending, and unequal, growth of the human population.

  "Laziness works. And the simple way to incorporate its health benefits into your life is simply to take a nap.": "Tom",
  "Today there are people trying to take away rights that our mothers, grandmothers and great-grandmothers fought for: our right to vote, our right to choose, affordable quality education, equal pay, access to health care. We the people can't let that happen.": "Kerry",
  "Our children lost our direction because they have been compromised. They have found freedom at the ballot box, and then they have taken on plastic chains around their minds and souls and mortgage their future on credit cards. They have to learn better - they have to learn the value of ideas and health as opposed to wealth.": "Andrew",

  "We face a choice this election. President Obama is fighting for changes that grow the economy from the middle out and help all Americans succeed - jobs, education, health reform, the DREAM Act, equal pay for women. He is moving us forward with opportunity today for prosperity tomorrow. Mitt Romney wants to take us back to yesterday.": "Eva",

  "One of the things I like best about 'Biggest Loser' is being around people who are trying to make the right choices.

  "I am well. Do not worry about my health.": "Rodrigo",

  "The biggest mistake people make is to try to lose too much weight too fast.": "Mehmet",
  "I used to have an obsession with building businesses and forgot about building health. I was focused on the destination instead of the journey. I caution you to not do the same.": "Vivek",

  "When the Veterans Affairs Department implemented a program to provide home-based health care to veterans with multiple chronic conditions - many of the system's most expensive patients to treat - they received astounding results.": "Ron",
  "It's totally different from last year because I came in with good shape with no health worries so it was about going out there and running well and enjoying it.": "Paula",

  "Public health and safety are my highest priorities.": "Kate",
  "When you start fooling around with drugs, you're hurting your creativity, you're hurting your health. Drugs are death, in one form or another. If they don't kill you, they kill your soul. And if your soul's dead, you've got nothing to offer, anyway.": "Paul",
  "There are environmental threats to health; there are internal threats to health - genetic conditions, viral threats, diseases like cancer and Parkinson's.

  "For sleep, riches and health to be truly enjoyed, they must be interrupted.": "Jean",
  "As musicians and artists, it's important we have an environment - and I guess when I say environment, I really mean the industry, that really nurtures these gifts.

  "We will empower patients as well as health professionals. We will disempower the hierarchy and bureaucracy.": "Andrew",
  "I see all kinds of people work hard all over the world, and some of them are barely making it. I don't just mean subsistence farmers.

  "I'm 58 years old and I just went through 8 back surgeries. They started cutting on me in February 2009, and I was basically bed ridden for almost two years. I got a real dose of reality that if you don't have your health, you don't have anything.": "Hulk",

  "Economists specialize in pointing out unpleasant trade-offs - a skill that is on full display in the health care debate. We want patients to receive the best care available.

  "The real truth is that the Obama administration is professional at bullying, as we have witnessed with ACORN at work during the presidential campaign.

  "I believe that how you feel is very important to how you look - that healthy equals beautiful.": "Victoria",
  "The average person doesn't understand what a stem cell is. There's a lack of health literacy in our nation.

  "If you take your kid in for the sniffles, you pay $20, but the full cost is $200.

  "From exam grading to health education to professional training to democratic participation, paths towards self-realization and success in the world are often daunting and obscure: journeys only the privileged feel confident setting off along.": "Tom",
  "Like health care, education is something worth spending on and worth investing in, but we're spending more and getting less.": "Tom",
  "I have a great race team, great grew members, awesome health care team, endocrinologist, nutritionist, and of course family and friends. It truly is a team effort, both when you are dealing with diabetes in regular life and also on the racetrack.": "Charlie",
  "People have criticized me for seeming to step out of my professional role to become undignifiedly political. I'd say it was belated realization that day care, good schools, health insurance, and nuclear disarmament are even more important aspects of pediatrics than measles vaccine or vitamin D.": "Benjamin",
  "If I have my health I can carry on. There will be a point when I do quit but I have absolutely no idea when that is.": "Alex",

When you look at the worst corners of the American health insurance industry or the sub-prime banking market, it really feels like the more psychopathically someone behaves, the more it's rewarded.": "Jon",

  "People are going to be living quite soon for 100 years. Our idea of how a family works no longer applies. It's no good saying you're going to have children for 15 years and then you're going to retire and have hobbies, because you've got 40 more years to go after 60 and you're in good health until 90 or something.": "Theodore",
  "Restoring responsibility and accountability is essential to the economic and fiscal health of our nation.": "Carl",

  "The Internet was appealing partly because it was something I could do in bed and feel like I was achieving something. I had an operation when I was 13 and ended up with complications, so I was in and out of the hospital. The bottom line is you can get through health challenges.

  "I feel pretty good. My body actually looks like an old banana, but it's fine.": "Mike",

  "All journeys have secret destinations of which the traveler is unaware.": "Martin",

  "Travel teaches as much as books.": "Youssou",
  "Even if you can't afford to travel the world, you can take your children to the museum, zoo or local park. And don't be afraid to take them to grown-up spots.

  "The first condition of understanding a foreign country is to smell it.": "Rudyard",
  "People don't understand that where I come from, everyone is either a convict, been in jail, been in a gang, is a hooligan of some sorts, but those are my brothers, my family and the people that I travel with. Those are the people that I roll with.": "Lupe",
  "I have no problem with the adventure travel movement. It makes better, more sensitive people. If you get people diving on a coral reef, they're going to become more respectful of the outdoors and more concerned with the threats that places like that face and they're going to care more about protecting them than they would have before.": "Tim",
  "The everyday kindness of the back roads more than makes up for the acts of greed in the headlines.": "Charles",

  "No one realizes how beautiful it is to travel until he comes home and rests his head on his old, familiar pillow.": "Lin",
  "I love single life! Why would it be boring? I mean, I get to travel around and have loads of girls screaming at me, so it's definitely not boring. However, it can get lonely on the road, but I'm sorted I've got good people around me.": "Olly",
  "When I travel, I feel more like a nomad than a tourist.": "Mohsin",
  "As I get older, the things that I want are starting to make more sense. Being able to travel makes me happy, and I am a person that lives in the moment. I also want to live a good life. Traveling makes everyday issues seem so much smaller and really changes my perspective on things.": "Jacqueline",
  "No one can travel your own road for you you must travel it for yourself. My faith in this stems from my childhood. I grew up in a family with a system of religious beliefs handed down to me. ": "Amy",
  "Songs really are like a form of time travel because they really have moved forward in a bubble. Everyone who's connected with it, the studio's gone, the musicians are gone, and the only thing that's left is this recording which was only about a three-minute period maybe 70 years ago.": "Tom",
  "During their service, men and women in our Armed Forces live by a common creed, promising never to leave a soldier behind. We should live by the same principle. When our veterans are asked to travel hundreds of miles for care that's offered right next door, we simply aren't living up to that standard, and something has to change.": "John",

  "How often I found where I should be going only by setting out for somewhere else.": "R.",
  "People commonly travel the world over to see rivers and mountains, new stars, garish birds, freak fish, grotesque breeds of human; they fall into an animal stupor that gapes at existence and they think they have seen something.": "Soren",
  "When I'm home, I spend Sunday with my husband. If we're not cooking, we travel around in our camper, stop at fast-food restaurants, and picnic. We love that stuff that will harden your arteries in a hurry.": "Dolly",
  "We would go back and maybe not say that thing to our dad that we said, or maybe be a little nicer to someone who we cared about and had a relationship with when we were young. You know, they're subtle things, but we carry those with us forever. And I think that regret and time travel are intrinsically linked to me.": "Colin",
  "I have wandered all my life, and I have also traveled; the difference between the two being this, that we wander for distraction, but we travel for fulfillment.": "Hilaire",
  "I would wear the blue overalls of the fieldworker and often wore round, rimless glasses known as Mazzawati teaglasses. I had a car, and I wore a chauffeur's cap with my overalls. The pose of chauffeur was convenient because I could travel under the pretext of driving my master's car.": "Nelson",
  "I want my handbags and my shoes to be stylish but I want to make sure that they're versatile. I travel and I have to make sure the pieces I put into my bag can go with a dress or with shorts or jeans.": "Maria",
  "I find the whole time travel question very unsettling if you take it to its logical extension. I think it might eventually be possible, but then what happens?": "William",

  "I get very homesick, but otherwise it's a great privilege to get to travel for work.": "Jesse",
  "The way that people feel changes everything. Feelings are forces. They cause us to time travel. And to leave ourselves, to leave our bodies. I would be that kind of psychologist who says, 'You're absolutely right - there are monsters under the bed.'": "Helen",

  "In Italy, they add work and life on to food and wine.": "Robin",

  "Travel works best when you're forced to come to terms with the place you're in.": "Paul",
  "There's no such thing as a specific authenticity to what Mexico is, because Mexico is incredibly complex and varied, and the food is completely different if you travel 50 kilometers. It just changes all the time.": "Gael",
  "Travel, which was once either a necessity or an adventure, has become very largely a commodity, and from all sides we are persuaded into thinking that it is a social requirement, too.": "Jan",
  "Spontaneity is what travel is all about.": "Zach",
  "Some people are drawn naturally - there are natural guitarists, and there are natural piano players, and I think guitar implies travel, a sort of footloose gypsy existence. You grab your bag and you go to the next town.": "Hugh",
  "You do not travel if you are afraid of the unknown, you travel for the unknown, that reveals you with yourself.": "Ella",

  "Working is actually a pleasure. It's just very time-consuming. It's a way of life. I find that I can work when I travel and work when I run. There is nothing like, on a rainy day, to work.": "Helmut",
  "Fitness is very important to me because it helps give me a routine when I travel. It gives me one hour of 'me' time and passes the time when I'm lonely. Living with scoliosis serves as a constant reminder to keep my core and back strong. If I get lazy, I feel it in my back first.": "Martha",
  "Immortality may be impossible, but imagine what humanity could learn if we all lived 700 years. We could travel deep into utopia and beyond.": "Gray",
  "I travel a lot I hate having my life disrupted by routine. ": "Caskie",

  "I think that one of the main privileges of what I do, which I am just starting to learn, is to have the ability to travel all over the world and experience different cultures.": "Chris",
  "I grew up in an era of thinking of travel as escape. The idea that you could conceivably have a new life, go somewhere, fall in love, have little children under the palm trees.": "Paul",
  "What draws me in is that a trip is a leap in the dark. It's like a metaphor for life. You set off from home, and in the classic travel book, you go to an unknown place. You discover a different world, and you discover yourself.": "Paul",
  "The two impulses in travel are to get away from home, and the other is to pursue something - a landscape, people, an exotic place. Certainly finding a place that you like or discovering something unusual is a very sustaining thing in travel.": "Paul",
  "I travel a lot, and I hunt for fabrics, then I have the tailor make me something.": "Waris",
  "Touring is great because I love to travel.": "Colin",

  "I'll bring my grits when I travel, because I get so hungry on the road.": "Dolly",
  "I travel with a bunch of battery packs because I don't always have time to charge my phone at the hotel room when I'm traveling. I always change them, so I never run out of battery.": "Avicii",

  "People travel north from Barcelona, not south.": "Jose",
  "When I was a kid, dressing right and looking good was a priority. As I grew up, I just wanted to stay that way, stick out a bit and have my own thing. That's where white belts and wearing some colors started. So signing with Puma was a great fit for me. I usually travel with nine pairs of golf shoes and 10 belts.": "Rickie",
  "I try to lead a pretty active lifestyle. My biggest hobby is traveling with my family. I love to travel to new places and try crazy things. I'm a bit of a daredevil, so I have done things like zip lining, parasailing, scuba diving, and reverse bungee jumping!": "Caroline",
  "Time travel offends our sense of cause and effect - but maybe the universe doesn't insist on cause and effect.": "Edward",
  "I had time with my mother, but I really lived with my father. One time he gave all his salary so I could travel to a training camp. He couldn't pay the rent, but he did that.": "Zlatan",
  "I'm not proud of it, but I'm a great liar when I travel. I smile and lie, and things are smooth.": "Paolo",
  "We need to protect our wilderness areas and national parks. Everywhere you travel, you see blight, denuded mountains, logging. If people know what's going on, they'll become activists to safeguard those places.": "Christie",
  "Radicals must be resilient, adaptable to shifting political circumstances, and sensitive enough to the process of action and reaction to avoid being trapped by their own tactics and forced to travel a road not of their choosing. In short, radicals must have a degree of control over the flow of events.": "Saul",
  "You learn so much about yourself as an artist. I never would have thought that I could sing every night, you know? Travel and perform every single night, and travel to another city the next day and do it all over again? You learn a lot of new things about yourself, and you make a lot of connections with people.": "Yuna",
  "No matter where I travel, I make sure to carry a Vaseline body lotion with me to keep my skin well moisturised all the time.": "Nargis",
  "When I was drafted to Smackdown, I was like, 'Hell yes, I'm going to captain this ship.' Then I was like, 'Oh, wait, you're losing your best friend and travel partner and the person you enjoy having matches with the absolute most.' That's Charlotte. We travel together, and she is my best friend.": "Becky",
  "I love listening to music on holiday, and back in the old days, I used to travel with cassette tapes and a boombox.": "Art",

  "The world has become more complex as technology and easy travel mixes cultures without homogenizing them.": "Norman",
  "We travel to learn; and I have never been in any country where they did not do something better than we do it, think some thoughts better than we think, catch some inspiration from heights above our own.": "Maria",
  "The social issues outside of football are not as defined as they were earlier, when integration took place and certain rights were legislated. The Civil Rights movement is over. Individuals can buy homes wherever they want, travel first class wherever they want, eat wherever they want.": "Jim",
  "Travel is so important in its capacity to expand the mind. It's exciting to start as young as possible - you get to see how other cultures live, challenge your senses, and try different cuisines.": "Natalie",
  "Connecting with people, getting things done - that's what makes the travel worthwhile.": "Tim",
  "Yeah, yeah, yeah, time travel's a nightmare. Don't go down that path.": "Domhnall",
  "I think young people should travel and travel often to other countries... like I do.": "Henry",

  "We've gotta reinvest in space travel. We should've never left the moon.": "Ray",
  "Travel is one of the best anti-war weapons that there are. I've been to Iran, and if you're there you see little kids, cops, old people, cemeteries. Once you see that, you can't say, 'Oh, Iran, let's bomb them.'": "Viggo",
  "I need to travel, of course, with my laptop, so I can do my business on the road.": "Theophilus",
  "Acting helped me as I was growing up. It helped me learn about myself, helped me travel, helped me understand life, express myself, all those wonderful things. So I'm very, very grateful; it's a fun job. It's a luxury.": "Angelina",
  "If you travel to Germany, it's still absolutely Germany. If you travel to Sweden, it still has a Swedish identity.": "Morrissey",

  "It doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman - stay alert and focused on your surroundings. Travel with friends. Know where you are at all times, and never let your guard down.": "Kimberly",
  "The thing about Hemingway that people forget is that all the stuff he did was at a time where people weren't traveling that much. At 19 he travels to Italy. He goes to the Spanish Civil War. He goes to China, he goes to Africa so at that time to travel that much is really incredible.": "Clive",
  "I think the most romantic thing you can do is just turn up. Turn up when it's difficult for you. Travel halfway around the world or just up the road. Whatever it is, just be there.": "James",
  "I don't really desire things. I prefer to spend my money on experiences, on meals or travel.": "Rachel",
  "When I think, where did I laugh the most, where did I eat the most, where did I just feel good all the time, I would say making the Bond movie 'Die Another Day.' To be part of such an iconic franchise and to travel to exotic places - that was the most fun I ever had.": "Halle",
  "We didn't travel much when I was little - most of what we did was visit various campsites around Conway, north Wales. My first major holiday abroad was to Ibiza with my parents when I was five. I vividly remember the plane touching down and that the hotel had great swings with lots of little lizards darting about that I was determined to catch.": "Paul",

  "We travel so much, I never adjust to time zones any more.": "Jillian",
  "I'd love to travel to the Holy Land.": "Loretta",
  "If I have to travel, I'm going to travel my way and travel in the real world. And I'm going to have conversations every day with people in rest stops and people in gas stations and people in hotels and diners. That nourishes me.": "Neil",
  "I grew up in South Africa and I would look at maps and we were at the bottom of the world. There was this whole thing up there. I was always reading encyclopedias about the world. So travel was something I was always attracted to.": "Charlize",
  "There comes a moment on a journey when something sweet, something irresistible and charming as wine raised to thirsty lips, wells up in the traveller's being.": "Patrick",
  "Because it's cheaper and easier to fly than ever before, air travel is becoming democratized.": "Peter",
  "If you travel in time and space, most of the people you know and love will eventually be gone. But you'll also be able to go and find them again.": "Peter",
  "To be able to travel the world, especially to places I never thought I'd be... it's really, you know, still fascinating for me.": "Beyonce",

  "Travel at least erodes some of the narrowness that exists in each of us.": "Pete",
  "Every traveler knows too well the endless quest for the perfect travel bag: the one that's stylish enough to carry through Paris, sturdy enough to tote around Peru, and - most important - doesn't make your shoulder sag even before you've loaded it up with everything you need for a day of sightseeing.": "Hanya",
  "I like to sit down, relax, have a cup of coffee on the terrace and read a book. I like to travel the world - and I'm lucky to see so much through cycling.": "Marianne",

  "Just got back from a pleasure trip: I took my mother-in-law to the airport.": "Henny",
  "'Closed timelike curve' is the jargon for time travel. It means you go out, come back and meet yourself in the past.": "Kip",
  "Dealing with global warming doesn't mean we have all got to suddenly stop breathing. Dealing with global warming means that we have to stop waste, and if you travel for no reason whatsoever, that is a waste.": "David",
  "While we celebrate our diversity, what surprises me time and time again as I travel around the constituency is that we are far more united and have far more in common with each other than things that divide us.": "Jo",
  "Travel, for me, is a little bit like being in love because suddenly, all your senses are at the setting marked 'on.' Suddenly, you're alert to the secret patterns of the world.": "Pico",
  "The helicopter is a fine way to travel, but it induces a view of the world that only God and CEOs share on a regular basis.": "Morley",

  "Travelers repose and dream among my leaves.": "William",
  "When the traveler goes alone he gets acquainted with himself.": "Liberty",
  "If you travel too often, you actually come face-to-face with what you're trying to escape. I feel like when I travel alone, sometimes it's like being locked in a hotel room with my own worst enemy.": "Simon",
  "Travel like a pro, not like a hobo. That's my motto.": "Greg",
  "When the plane is delayed, it's not the fault of the girl at the desk. I'm resigned to the fact that everything is out of my control and that air travel nowadays is barbaric.": "Tom",
  "We take so many of our freedoms for granted nowadays - I can travel where I like, I can do any job I want - but I think chivalry has been lost a little bit.": "Michelle",
  "For my part, I travel not to go anywhere, but to go. I travel for travel's sake. The great affair is to move.": "Robert",
  "Don't time travel into the past, roaming through the nuances as if they can change. Don't bookmark pages you've already read.": "James",
  "I'm not a big spender or shopper. Neither am I extravagant, nor do I have big expenses. I mainly spend on travel. I don't buy overpriced clothes, as I feel such expenses are unnecessary. I probably wouldn't buy expensive watches or jewellery either.": "Katrina",
  "Each and every one of the security measures we implement serves an important goal: providing safe and efficient air travel for the millions of people who rely on our aviation system every day.": "Janet",
  "I grew up skateboarding; it was fun. I didn't think about money, I didn't know how much professional skateboarders made. I just knew that if I became a professional skateboarder, I would achieve a lot and get to travel and do these great things.": "Jason",
  "I always like to arrive at the airport early to enjoy breakfast and lounge about so that when I get on the plane all my travel fever has disappeared.": "Julian",
  "I don't especially like to travel, not the way many people do. I know many people that love to go to far-off and different places, and I've never been like that. I seem to get homesick as quickly as a child.": "Elizabeth",
  "The Journey of Reconciliation was organized not only to devise techniques for eliminating Jim Crow in travel, but also as a training ground for similar peaceful projects against discrimination in such major areas as employment and in the armed services.": "Bayard",
  "Travel at faster than the speed of light certainly can have dramatic implications that are difficult to understand, such as time travel.": "Lisa",
  "Whenever possible, I use local, fresh ingredients, just because it tastes and feels better to eat an egg or a tomato or a hamburger that wasn't flown halfway around the world, that didn't travel on a truck and get stuck in traffic jams, that hasn't been sitting in a supermarket's refrigerator case for days.": "Kate",
  "I really have created a family. I work with the people I love, I travel with them, I make films with them, and I'm in an office with them. So in a weird way - I know I haven't birthed a child - I feel that I'm a part of creating a family. It's a tribe. I love that word.": "Drew",
  "What does it mean to pre-board? Do you get on before you get on?": "George",
  "People who don't travel cannot have a global view, all they see is what's in front of them. Those people cannot accept new things because all they know is where they live.": "Martin",

  "I think I am a travel junkie, and I have never enjoyed anything else in my life more than travelling and going to places.": "Imtiaz",
  "All travel has its advantages. If the passenger visits better countries, he may learn to improve his own. And if fortune carries him to worse, he may learn to enjoy it.": "Samuel",
  "I don't mind where I work, it's really nice to be able to travel around and taste the flavours of different countries.": "Toni",
  "I am a passionate traveler, and from the time I was a child, travel formed me as much as my formal education. In order to appreciate cultures of another nation, one needs to go there, know the people and mingle with the culture of that country. One way to do that, if one is lucky enough, is to buy things from those cultures.": "David",
  "Yeah. I've been pretty fortunate to travel I guess, all around the place.": "Ben",
  "Tell people you're a Canadian or a Kiwi when you travel and they'll adore you.": "Daniel",
  "There was part of me that wanted to see the world and travel to distant places, but I could only do it in my imagination, so I read ferociously and imagined things.": "George",
  "Fifty years of isolating Cuba had failed to promote democracy, setting us back in Latin America. That's why we restored diplomatic relations, opened the door to travel and commerce, and positioned ourselves to improve the lives of the Cuban people.": "Barack",
  "Thursday night football is here to stay. So we're looking at ways to make it safer. Now they're playing division games, so you limit travel. Now the question is, should you play Sunday night before a Thursday night?": "John",

  "Travelers never think that they are the foreigners.": "Mason",

  "You develop a sympathy for all human beings when you travel a lot.": "Shakuntala",
  "In this world, shipmates, sin that pays its way can travel freely, and without passport; whereas Virtue, if a pauper, is stopped at all frontiers.": "Herman",
  "Travel is the most private of pleasures. There is no greater bore than the travel bore. We do not in the least want to hear what he has seen in Hong Kong.": "Vita",
  "Through travel I first became aware of the outside world it was through travel that I found my own introspective way into becoming a part of it. ": "Eudora",
  "Some minds improve by travel, others, rather, resemble copper wire, or brass, which get the narrower by going farther.": "Thomas",
  "I only travel to good material, a good director and a good company. I won't work in another country for a year any longer, because I have a lovely wife and I adore her and I can't bear to be away from her.": "Jim",
  "Before the BBC, I joined the Navy in order to travel.": "David",
  "My sisters and I were fortunate to travel through Asia and Europe at very young ages. We confronted extraordinary beauty in Athens and unspeakable poverty in India.": "Mary",
  "Well, I took a sabbatical. I walked away from shooting movies because I couldn't handle the travel. I'm a single parent. I had young kids, and I found that keeping in touch with them from hotel rooms and airports wasn't working for me. So I stopped.": "Rick",
  "A careful inspection showed them that, even if they succeeded in righting it by themselves, the cart would travel no longer. The axles were in a hopeless state, and the missing wheel was shattered into pieces.": "Kenneth",
  "Besides, I'm a gypsy at heart and I like to travel around.": "Reba",
  "I travel for work, but recently, friends said I should take major trips.": "Jeff",
  "I am traveling less in order to be able to write more. I select my travel destinations according to their degree of usefulness to my work.": "Jose",
  "Travel, of course, narrows the mind.": "Malcolm",
  "If you travel to the States... they have a lot of different words than like what we use. For instance: they say 'elevator', we say 'lift'; they say 'drapes', we say 'curtains'; they say 'president', we say 'seriously deranged git.'": "Alexei",
  "Whenever I think of the high salaries we are paid as film actors, I think it is for the travel, the time away, and any trouble you get into through being well known. It's not for the acting, that's for sure.": "Bill",
  "I've got a real sense of three-dimensional geometry. I can look at a flat piece of fabric and know that if I put a slit in it and make some fabric travel around a square, then when you lift it up it will drape in a certain way, and I can feel how that will happen.": "Vivienne",
  "The amount of hassle involved in travel can be overwhelming.": "Paul",
  "Southern political personalities, like sweet corn, travel badly. They lose flavor with every hundred yards away from the patch. By the time they reach New York, they are like Golden Bantam that has been trucked up from Texas - stale and unprofitable. The consumer forgets that the corn tastes different where it grows.": "A.",
  "As a person, I was born to give out my opinions. By giving out my opinions, I realize who I am. As long as I can communicate, I'm not so lonely. If I cannot travel, or do art, or have company, if they take away all my belongings, it doesn't matter at all.": "Ai",
  "My ideal travel companions are my surfboard, wetsuit, and guitar.": "Alexander",
  "I don't like to leave anything unfinished on my desk before I travel.": "Vijay",
  "Beyond racing, I just love the art form of running, of conceiving new ideas like the 50 Marathons in 50 States in 50 Days. It's the ultimate expression of what I love to do, which is run, and travel, and see this great country.": "Dean",
  "You can get too close as a team. You need time away from each other. You change in the same dressing room, you play on the same cricket field, you stay in the same hotel, you travel in the same planes and buses. C'mon - this business of everyone holding hands and being pally is nonsense.": "Glenn",
  "Each and every day, more people pay the price of Obamacare's mountain of mandates. As I travel across the country, I continue to hear from Americans who want Washington to take its hands off of their healthcare.": "John",
  "It never ceases to amaze me that every second of every day, more than 6,000 billion neutrinos coming from nuclear reactions inside the sun whiz through my body, almost all of which will travel right through the earth without interruption.": "Lawrence",
  "The poem is not, as someone put it, deflective of entry. But the real question is, 'What happens to the reader once he or she gets inside the poem?' That's the real question for me, is getting the reader into the poem and then taking the reader somewhere, because I think of poetry as a kind of form of travel writing.": "Billy",
  "I went out to the desert where Cleopatra camped out with her mercenary army. It's a desolate outpost. Nothing has changed since her day. You realize how far she had to travel. Not only is it a good 150 miles against the current, you can't take a ship.": "Stacy",
  "I usually travel with a posse. I roll deep. I travel like a rapper, but without the artillery. We don't carry guns, we carry cookies.": "Gabriel",
  "Almost all of my jobs have been on locations. And I think you can be that person who says, 'I have a job that forces me to travel and I'm just going to go ahead and do it and pray for my next flight home.' Or 'this is where I am, this is my life, let me see a part of this world I now live in.'": "Erin",
  "In 1967 I entered Harvard as a freshman, confident - in the way that only 17-year-olds are - that I could change the world. My major was African Studies, and my plan was to travel to Tanzania, where President Julius Nyerere was creating a government based on democracy and socialism.": "Bonnie",
  "The Book of Mormon is our handbook of instructions as we travel the pathway from bad to good to better and strive to have our hearts changed.": "David",
  "The idea of traveling in Africa for me is based on going by road or train or bus or whatever and crossing borders. You can't travel easily or at all through some countries.": "Paul",
  "Antigravity, teleportation, time travel, energetic DNA evolution and consciousness transformation could create a world few of us ever even dreamed of.": "David",
  "Originally, the burden of proof was on physicists to prove that time travel was possible. Now the burden of proof is on physicists to prove there must be a law forbidding time travel.": "Michio",
  "I really cherish the memories I have of my trips. For some reason, when you travel, it's like your mind picks up on the fact that this is something uncharacteristic, so it tunes in more acutely and remembers better.": "Jennette",
  "Slow travel now rivals the fly-to-Barcelona-for-lunch culture. Advocates savour the journey, travelling by train or boat or bicycle, or even on foot, rather than crammed into an airplane. They take time to plug into the local culture instead of racing through a list of tourist traps.": "Carl",
  "You don't need to be a spook to care about encryption. If you travel with your computer or keep it in a place where other people can put their hands on it, you're vulnerable.": "Barton",
  "The Patriot Act unleashed the FBI to search your email, travel and credit records without even a suspicion of wrongdoing.": "Barton",
  "On stage, you're not limited at all because you're free in language: language is the source of the imagination. You can travel farther in language than you can in any film.": "Sam",
  "For more and more of us, home has really less to do with a piece of soil than, you could say, with a piece of soul. If somebody suddenly asks me, 'Where's your home?' I think about my sweetheart or my closest friends or the songs that travel with me wherever I happen to be.": "Pico",
  "I want my wife and children to travel always with me and share good things and bad things. That's what the family is for.": "Marcello",
  "Making money is often more fun than spending it, though I personally have never regretted money I've spent on friends, new experiences, saving time, travel, and causes I believe in.": "Sam",
  "A beam of light takes about two million years to reach from us to the Andromeda nebula. But my thought covers this distance in a few seconds. Perhaps some day some intermediate form of body and mind may permit us to say that we actually can travel faster than light.": "Ragnar",
  "My fans are honestly so unique and so similar. Wherever I travel, they are so, so different but so the same.": "Lilly",
  "The symphonies are the things that, as a soloist, I've not gotten to play. I used to travel the world playing concertos, and then I would sit and listen to the symphony.": "Joshua",
  "I was told at first that being different was a bad thing. Everywhere I went, it was just, 'You're too different'... And it turned out that being different was the best thing that ever happened to my career. It is why people travel to my shows. It's why people want to hear my story and buy my book.": "Lindsey",
  "Mom somehow made it to every one of my graduations - even when it meant she had to travel far away.": "Rick",
  "The travel book is a convenient metaphor for life, with its optimistic beginning or departure, its determined striving, and its reflective conclusion. Journeys change travellers just as a good travel book can change readers.": "Rory",
  "As I travel the world, it seems that younger people identify me merely with some of the folklore in the 'Chuck Norris Facts' - those hyperbolic sayings that elevate my abilities beyond my capabilities. Others view me in light of the character I played in 'Walker, Texas Ranger' or in one of my 20 tough-guy films.": "Chuck",
  "If you think about a lifestyle short of retirement that lends itself to being a hardcore gamer, there is none better than being a major league starting pitcher. I work once every five days and travel and am alone all the time. So while the other guys were spending their money on the all the cars and jewelry, I bought laptops.": "Curt",
  "The only way I'm going to support my family is to tour. I love playing, don't get me wrong. That 90 minutes every night, that's free. We get paid to travel. But every night, I have to get myself locked in. There are a thousand people that don't want to be disappointed, because they have a lot of expectations.": "Sturgill",
  "In a great many stories that deal with time travel, there's usually somebody who knows how time travel works. They lay out the rules.": "Diana",
  "In his very first film, Mr. Gonzalez Inarritu makes the kind of journey some directors don't - or can't - travel in an entire career.": "Elvis",
  "Good-quality travel and good-quality food are the two luxuries that I never have any guilt indulging in.": "Charlie",
  "Background scores allow me an absolute flight of the imagination, and I travel in my mind's eye. I do not like the scores to have vocal notes, because they act as a limitation to these flights of fancy.": "Nawazuddin",
  "Just to be a part of something that can travel beyond and reach the lives of people and help them through a daily problem or struggle or even just giving encouraging words, period. I feel like it's very powerful. I thank God for my gift.": "BJ",

  "I have a secret project which adds four hours every day to the 24 hours we have. There's a bit of time travel involved.": "Sundar",
  "Restore human legs as a means of travel. Pedestrians rely on food for fuel and need no special parking facilities.": "Lewis",
  "I like animals. I like natural history. The travel bit is not the important bit. The travel bit is what you have to do in order to go and look at animals.": "David",
  "It's wonderful to travel with somebody that you love and we never travel anywhere without one another.": "Roger",

  "There are few places you can find silence. Air travel could be the last fortress of solitude.": "Regina",
  "The average Londoner knows just one neighbour. I travel a lot, and I'm always surprised by the strong sense of community in some countries. We've lost something fundamentally human, and we don't even realise it.": "Lily",
  "I'm a big fan of the laceless Converse for travel, with cute jeans, and throw on a little jacket, and you look presentable.": "Melissa",
  "I am a control freak, but not when I travel. For some reason when I travel, I am able to surrender more than in my real life. I am able to let go. I think it's why I like it so much.": "Chelsea",
  "Finney is about the best writer of time travel stories ever, and I adore time travel stories - have to make a time travel game someday!": "Warren",
  "I do think that travel can be part of a journey of inner maturation, but you've got to do it right.": "Alain",

  "I'm generally so disoriented during the week about what I'm doing and where I am - I travel a lot - that when I'm home on a Sunday, I typically try to sleep in as much as I can.": "Mike",
  "A travel book is a book that puts you in the shoes of the traveler, and it's usually a book about having a very bad time; having a miserable time, even better.": "Paul",
  "I don't think I'd be happy if I were satisfied. I enjoy challenge, and I wouldn't say that I'm an ambitious person career-wise or financially, really. I would like to travel more comfortably, but that's really about all I need.": "Jason",
  "When I had money in the past, I would always travel rather than spend it on big apartments or cars. And I still feel exactly the same way.": "Robin",
  "Interviewing Rei Kawakubo in Tokyo and John Galliano in Paris, both for 'Pop' magazine, were huge for me, not just in learning about fashion and writing but about how little desire I had to be a critic/reporter/journalist/commentator so much as a kind of travel diarist.": "Tavi",
  "I love to travel, and I think being whisked away somewhere for a vacation is a pretty amazing date. But, I'm really into the basic movie and dinner. It's not where you are but who you're with that really matters.": "Alexandra",
  "I do love traveling, so I've been able to travel a lot.": "Taylor",
  "You know you're a hopeless record nerd when your time travel fantasies always come around to how cool it would be to go back to 1973 and buy all the great funk and jazz and salsa records that came out that year on tiny obscure labels and are now really rare and expensive.": "Adam",
  "I just don't see myself as a travel writer. I can't. I don't.": "Robyn",
  "My keen love of travel was seldom hindered by Father. He permitted me, even as a mere boy, to visit many cities and pilgrimage spots.": "Paramahansa",
  "The reason why people wear pajamas to the airport in the first place is so that they'll be comfortable during their flight. But you know, typically, air travel is 50 to 75 percent of the time you spend traveling. The rest of the time you spend in public places like airports and around other people. That's when looking good trumps comfort.": "Casey",
  "I had rather have a fool to make me merry than experience to make me sad and to travel for it too!": "William",
  "The whole infrastructure of air travel was, and is, part of government policy. It is not a natural development of a free economic system - at least not in the way that is claimed. The same is true of the roads, of course.": "Noam",
  "Today, we have private airline companies, but if you take a look at a Boeing plane next time you travel, you'll see that you are basically taking a ride on a modified bomber.": "Noam",
  "I just travel the world with my backpack and my cameras and a bunch of Clif bars.": "Henry",
  "A lot of Americans don't have a passport, never will have a passport. Not only will they not travel, they don't want to travel.": "Henry",
  "The Bad Seeds are a band I will travel a great distance to see whenever possible.": "Henry",
  "I do have to travel a lot for speaking engagements.": "P.",
  "If you were to actually travel around schools and universities and listen in on lectures about evolution, you might find a fairly substantial fraction of young people, without knowing what it is they disapprove of, think they disapprove of it, because they've been brought up to.": "Richard",
  "Remember travel agents? Remember how they just kind of vanished one day? Well, that's where all the other jobs that once made us middle class are going, to that same magical, class-killing, job-sucking wormhole into which travel agency jobs vanished, never to return.": "Douglas",
  "My favorite books to give or get are short story collections. And always paperbacks because they are easy to carry as you travel.": "Chuck",
  "Fuel prices are at the center of our lives. They affect our ability to travel, stay warm, and feed ourselves.": "Robert",
  "Even today, when the Obama administration has liberalized travel to Cuba - and failed to reverse that liberalization when Alan Gross was imprisoned - there are limits.": "Elliott",
  "When I go back to Texas, I travel the state, and I see people all the time who come up to me, men and women across Texas, and they grab me by the shoulder, and they're afraid. They say, 'Ted, you know, I just lost my health insurance. I got a child with diabetes. I'm scared. Please stop this from happening.'": "Ted",
  "It's important to travel and move and have a continual set of experiences so you've got more to feed back into your work. For me, it's a natural thing.": "Cate",
  "I think the only thing I knew for sure is that I wanted to, whatever I did, I wanted to travel with my work, an adventurous spirit.": "Cate",
  "I've always said that I use my voice as an instrument. It was something I created myself, and I said, 'Have voice, will travel.'": "Yoko",
  "I travel a lot, so when I arrive in a city, I like to go to good local bookshops and make a selection based on how I'm feeling and what I'm thinking. The book I pick usually seems to have a definite karmic connection!": "Yoko",
  "A hybrid human-robot mission to investigate an asteroid affords a realistic opportunity to demonstrate new technological capabilities for future deep-space travel and to test spacecraft for long-duration spaceflight.": "Buzz",
  "I still make sure to go, at least once every year, to a country where things cannot be taken for granted, and where there is either too much law and order or too little.": "Christopher",
  "If you are a reader of 'Harper's Bazaar,' to me, you are a woman who loves fashion, but not just fashion; you love fashion, you love travel, you love art, you love music.": "Carine",
  "The whole object of travel is not to set foot on foreign land it is at last to set foot on one's own country as a foreign land. ": "Gilbert",
  "I have flown with British Airways since I was a very little child, so it feels quite special to have gone from family holidays flying around Europe to become a gold card holder and be spoiled enough to travel more than not in first class.": "Orlando",
  "I'm a big fan of doing 'Triple D.' But I don't want to do it forever, don't get me wrong! Travel away from my family, are you crazy? But do you know what it does for these mom-and-pop restaurant joints? It changes their lives forever. I mean, their businesses will never be the same.": "Guy",
  "I don't sleep very well when I travel. And as a result, I tend to be awake in cities when everyone else is asleep.": "Moby",
  "It's hardly a secret that I'm skeptical of declarations that the aliens are out and about on our planet. Still, I try to answer every one of these mails and phone calls because, after all, it's not a violation of physics to travel from one star system to another.": "Seth",
  "While human space travel is daunting, machines - with their indefinitely long lifetimes - could travel the galaxy. It might make little difference to them that bridging the distance from one star to the next could take hundreds of thousands of years or more.": "Seth",
  "A practical way to travel between the stars is a must-have for space opera, and a sine qua non for our frequently vaunted future as a galactic society.": "Seth",
  "I take a cooking class everywhere I travel. I find it's the best way to get to know a culture.": "Blake",
  "I would love to be a travel writer. I'd be so stoked.": "Drew",
  "And it was a great experience, you know, to travel the world and compete at a certain level. It teaches you discipline, focus, and certainly keeps you out of trouble.": "Jason",
  "I've been lucky to travel and work all over the world through the lens of the back of the house, and I love that monocle. I love that lens, because it's real people.": "Marcus",
  "It's often hard for us to imagine going without some of our luxuries like travel, dining out, or Internet, much less our basic necessities like food and water. But try for a minute to imagine how life would be with such deprivations.": "Marcus",
  "I only travel with a carry-on suitcase in most instances.": "Brad",
  "Being an actor, imitating to the point of inhabiting the lives of others, may simply be a way of continuing to do what I learned to do as a boy - to travel, mentally and physically.": "Viggo",
  "What should I have known or written had I been a quiet, mercantile politician or a lord in waiting? A man must travel, and turmoil, or there is no existence.": "Lord",
  "There can be many reasons to travel, but wandering into the world for no particular reason is a sublime madness, which in all its whimsy and pointlessness may depict the story of life - and indeed could be a useful model to keep in mind, seeing as so much of life's ambition comes unstuck or leads to nothing much at all.": "Michael",
  "Science fiction is filled with Martians and space travel to other planets, and things like that.": "Margaret",
  "I love to prune my roses. That's the one thing I really feel I do pretty well. Other things I usually, because I travel so much, leave to my gardeners who know what I love. But I do love to prune them, because you forget everything else. It's like if you're a painter, you can forget everything else while you're doing it.": "Julie",
  "Actually, I had a lot of good people with me - my mother's sister did a lot of taking care of me, and I suppose I got more attention than my stepbrothers because at least I got to travel with my parents.": "Julie",
  "The real luxury travel of the modern age is not through space it's through time. ": "Nancy",
  "Our deeds still travel with us from afar, and what we have been makes us what we are.": "George",
  "I collect travel alarm clocks. I was in a flea market in France once, in 1994, and I opened up this beautiful Jaeger-LeCoultre folding eight-day winding clock folded into a beautiful case, and I went, 'Wow, man.' And I've been collecting travel alarm clocks since 1994.": "Alec",
  "There are some times when you make films and you travel places, and the take that people in the business have is that the worst way to see a city is to shoot there, because you work these long 12, 13 and 14-hour days, and you go home to the hotel, you eat, and you pass out.": "Alec",
  "With the dramatic increase in ease of transportation and the incredible decrease in the amount of time required to travel between far-flung areas of the United States, representatives began spending more and more time in Washington and less and less time in their home districts.": "Ben",
  "Schubert had arguably the same melodic gift as Mozart, but even less support. He didn't have the early exposure, never got to travel anywhere, and yet generated and amassed a body of work that grew and developed and is very profound.": "Twyla",
  "I dress well. I travel; I seem to be relatively glamorous for a film guy - which, to me, is like being the fastest midget in the circus.": "Elvis",
  "People in the CIA, they marry each other. They're like actors! We have to travel without much warning to far-flung places, and it's very hard to communicate what our experiences are like to those in the outside world.": "Claire",
  "I think it's very important for writers and artists generally to be witnesses to the world, and to be transparent. To let other people speak... to travel... to experience the world. And memorialize it.": "Joyce",
  "Through machinery, man can exert tremendous powers almost as fantastic as if he were the hero of a fairy tale. Through machinery, man can travel with an ever increasing velocity; he can fly through the air and go beneath the surface of the ocean.": "Maria",
  "I do not like people touching my underwear. That's just weird! I travel with a washer and dryer, and I like cooking on the bus, too.": "Carrie",
  "The glamour of air travel - its aspirational meaning in the public imagination - disappeared before its luxury did, dissipating as flying gradually became commonplace.": "Virginia",
  "The glamour of twentieth-century air travel helped to persuade once-fearful travelers to take to the skies and encouraged parochial Americans to go out and see the world.": "Virginia",
  "People without children do have the freedom to do things that caring parents with dependent kids can't - to work long hours, to travel frequently, to relocate, and to do all these things on short notice if necessary. In return, they can achieve positions that devoted parents can't.": "Virginia",
  "I just can't do heels any more. At least not when I'm working. I travel a lot.": "Victoria",
  "Under the cover of encryption, terror masterminds provide recruits with the tactics and tools necessary to carry out attacks using small arms and explosives. None of this requires any overseas travel.": "Tom",
  "Today, few terrorist organizations still employ the 'al-Qaeda model' in which individuals travel to terrorist training camps overseas and then are deployed to the West to inflict atrocities.": "Tom",
  "The first time probably people really were aware of me, I unfortunately had the title of Showtime's Funniest Person in America. And that's a really tough title to travel around with when you're not even known.": "Ellen",
  "If I were involved with the NBA, I wouldn't want a 19-year-old or a 20-year-old kid to bring into all the travel and all the problems that exist in the NBA. I would want a much more mature kid. I would want a kid that maybe I've been watching on another team, and now he's 21, 22 years old instead of 18 or 19, and I might trade for that kid.": "Bobby",
  "I read on my iPad when I travel. I listen to audiobooks in the car. I read books in my bedroom, where I have a comfortable couch, a lamp and two dogs to keep me warm.": "Isabel",
  "I collect a lot of clothes when I travel around the world.": "Theophilus",
  "A wise traveler never despises his own country.": "William",
  "It is not fit that every man should travel; it makes a wise man better, and a fool worse.": "William",
  "As a Global Maternal Health Advocate, I get to travel the world quite a bit, meeting individuals and visiting programs with tremendous potential and incredible vision to improve the quality of life for countless others.": "Christy",
  "People forget I go to work. They forget that the Coleridge house was bought and paid for by the daughter of a travel agent and a barmaid from what the actor Richard Burton once described as the nightmarish 'featureless suburb' of Croydon.": "Kate",
  "It was a rural upbringing by the seaside. A real quiet place surrounded by fields. I had to travel into town for school and stuff like that.": "Hozier",
  "I travel all the time, but when I come back to the South, I see such progress. In a real sense, a great deal of the South has been redeemed. People feel freer, more complete, more whole, because of what happened in the movement.": "John",
  "Technology doesn't address everything - for example, air travel still sucks.": "Brad",
  "You define a good flight by negatives: you didn't get hijacked, you didn't crash, you didn't throw up, you weren't late, you weren't nauseated by the food. So you are grateful.": "Paul",
  "I think people read travel books either because they intend to take that trip, or because they would never take that trip. In a sense, as a writer you are doing the travel for the reader.": "Paul",
  "One of the things the 'Tao of Travel' shows is how unforthcoming most travel writers are, how most travelers are. They don't tell you who they were traveling with, and they're not very reliable about things that happened to them.": "Paul",
  "The job of the travel writer is to go far and wide, to make voluminous notes, to tell the truth.": "Paul",
  "Extensive traveling induces a feeling of encapsulation, and travel, so broadening at first, contracts the mind.": "Paul",
  "A travel book is about someone who goes somewhere, travels on the ground, sees something and spends quite a lot of time doing it, and has a hard time, and then comes back and writes about it. It's not about inventing.": "Paul",
  "Mark Twain was a great traveler and he wrote three or four great travel books. I wouldn't say that I'm a travel novelist but rather a novelist who travels - and who uses travel as a background for finding stories of places.": "Paul",
  "I was raised in a large family. The first reason for my travel was to get away from my family. I knew that I wanted to be a writer, but I didn't want people to ask me questions about it.": "Paul",
  "The worst thing that can happen to you in travel is having a gun pointed at you by a very young person. That's happened to me maybe four times in my life. I didn't like it.": "Paul",
  "The appeal of travel books is also the sense that you are different, an outsider, almost like the Robinson Crusoe or Christopher Columbus notion of being the first person in a new place.": "Paul",
  "I wouldn't say that I'm a travel novelist, but rather a novelist who travels - and who uses travel as a background for finding stories of places.": "Paul",
  "The travel impulse is mental and physical curiosity. It's a passion. And I can't understand people who don't want to travel.": "Paul",
  "There is simply no defending the preferred mode of travel for many of the celebrity crazies who lecture us about carbon credits. Do you think these folks are willing to give up their mansions and private jets in order to 'save the planet?'": "Mike",
  "I think it's important that kids have responsibilities and understand the value of things, but I think it's great I get to travel the world with my daughter.": "Salma",
  "I'm a little bit phobic about stains on my clothes, so I never travel without a little packet of organic stain remover.": "John",
  "I like to go to work, and also, I don't have any kids. I don't have any hobbies. I don't like to travel. So going to work is kind of it.": "Christopher",
  "My life is really quite conservative. I've been married nearly 50 years. I don't have hobbies or children. I don't much care to travel. I've never had a big social life. I really just stay home, except when I go to work.": "Christopher",
  "I always want off-the-beaten-path, Anthony Bourdain-inspired travel.": "Meghan",
  "On a normal day, I love a shift dress with flats and a little cropped jacket. That, for me, is my travel wear if it's not too chilly - you can throw a scarf over your legs if it's cold on the plane!": "Meghan",
  "Utrip makes it easy for travelers to experience the destination highlights that most interest them, be it food, art or history. Just like a culinary experience, every palate is different, and Utrip is all about personalizing travel for their users.": "Tom",
  "I have two kids, career and I travel, and I don't think my life is any different than most couples. The most valuable commodity now for many people is time and how to parcel that out.": "Hugh",
  "I like to engage the public because when I was in high school, I had all these questions about anti-matter, higher dimensions and time travel. Every time I went to the library, every time I asked people these questions, I would get some strange looks. Nobody could answer any of these questions.": "Michio",
  "Time travel and teleportation will have to wait. It may take centuries to master these technology. But within the coming decades, we will understand dark matter, perhaps test string theory, find planets which can harbor life, and maybe have Brain 2.0, i.e. our consciousness on a disk which will survive even after we die.": "Michio",
  "When you grow up in a place, you always think it's mundane. Then you travel around and live in different places, and you realise that you've got it the wrong way 'round.": "Irvine",
  "It's very expensive to be a professional tennis player with all the travel and the flights and the hotels and everything.": "Caroline",
  "Social media has allowed groups, such as ISIL, to use the Internet to spot and assess potential recruits. With the widespread horizontal distribution of social media, terrorists can identify vulnerable individuals of all ages in the United States - spot, assess, recruit, and radicalize - either to travel or to conduct a homeland attack.": "James",
  "People just hate the idea of losing. Any loss, even a small one, is just so terrible to contemplate that they compensate by buying insurance, including totally absurd policies like air travel.": "Daniel",
  "I think kids ought to travel. I think it's very good to carry kids around. It's good for them. Of course it's tough on the parents.": "Doris",
  "At some point, the government expands into the private sphere so far that you live in a place with a whole lot less freedom. I didn't like that that was the direction of travel for our country, and decided to come to Washington to try and be a small part of bringing it back.": "Mike",
  "Travel makes a wise man better, and a fool worse.": "Thomas",
  "Strange - is it not? That of the myriads who Before us passed the door of Darkness through, Not one returns to tell us of the road Which to discover we must travel too.": "Horace",
  "I mean, I'd love to have a private jet - I know people who fly by private jet all the time... I've hitched a ride a few times and it is not overrated at all; it's a great way to travel!": "Marc",
  "Now, I have a kid, I have businesses to take care of, I have to travel. I have to sit down... and find a little time for me.": "Nadia",
  "My favorite spot is the Maldives. Since I travel so much for work, I like to go to places that are very secluded and quiet.": "Irina",
  "I don't buy a lot when I travel, but when I do, I like to send gifts from wherever I am. It's fun to find the local post office.": "Juliana",
  "One of the things that I love to do is travel around the world and look at archaeological sites. Because archaeology gives us an opportunity to study past civilizations, and see where they succeeded and where they failed. Use science to, you know, work backwards and say, 'Well, really, what were they thinking?'": "Nathan",
  "The way Moore's Law occurs in computing is really unprecedented in other walks of life. If the Boeing 747 obeyed Moore's Law, it would travel a million miles an hour, it would be shrunken down in size, and a trip to New York would cost about five dollars. Those enormous changes just aren't part of our everyday experience.": "Nathan",
  "Very early on, when I started doing these plays and live shows, I would travel from city to city, and there were a million shows out there... so I wanted to step out among it, and I started putting my name above the title.": "Tyler",
  "Sometimes you want to go for a walk and you don't want to be watched. You just want to be anonymous and blend in. Especially when I travel, I feel that way, because I can't really go out and see a city the way other people can and I miss out on a lot.": "Madonna",
  "Work done by other people sounds easy. How hard can it be to take care of a newborn who sleeps 20 hours a day? How hard can it be to keep track of your billable hours? To travel for one night for business? To get a 4-year-old ready for school? To return a few phone calls? To load the dishwasher? To fill out some forms?": "Gretchen",
  "When 'Apollo 13' appeared as an opportunity and I began to tackle that in as authentic a way as I possibly could, I really became enthralled by the philosophical side of space travel and why we need to explore - what it means to us here on Earth - all of those things. I became a huge proponent.": "Ron",
  "After a lifetime of world travel I've been fascinated that those in the third world don't have the same perception of reality that we do.": "Jim",
  "Age focuses you. You are much better concentrated. There's more time when you travel less, don't do book tours, avoid interviews or public appearances. You walk the dogs, fish, hunt, cook and write.": "Jim",
  "I travel with Club Glove.": "Jason",
  "My son is so fortunate, you know. He's always going to have food. Yes, my children are going to be privileged, but that's why it's so important for them to see different realities and to travel, and they do already.": "Gisele",
  "I live in a town called Beerwah, right in the middle of Australia Zoo. It's not hustle and bustle and busy, so that's helpful. We travel all over the world, but I've always been able to come home and run around in the middle of the Australian outback.": "Bindi",
  "I guess, growing up at Australia Zoo and getting to travel all over the world, I have this great outlook on life, and that's what I hope I inspire other kids to have.": "Bindi",
  "My family didn't have money to travel, so reading was how I knew about the world. It made me hungry to have more experiences than just what I could possibly experience in Arkansas.": "Mary",
  "Any time I have any time off, I try to travel.": "Margot",
  "My jet lag is getting a bit ridiculous. But, you know, it's first-world problems. It's a wonderful problem, 'Oh I have to travel around the world; how awful.'": "Margot",
  "We have so much pride in welcoming these passengers onto the plane, and they have so much pride in travel. It's something that I definitely always remember, when I'm playing a scene on the plane, just to imbue everything with that sense of excitement.": "Christina",
  "When I'm in London I do have the convenience of being close to St James Park which is also good for me because it gives me an excuse to get out and get some much needed exercise!": "David",
  "The more I travel around the world, the more I see people want the same thing - to be happy. We wouldn't be in a monetary system if we didn't have to work, so if my music can contribute to happiness, then that's my main responsibility.": "Jason",
  "I only travel with one suitcase - Mulberry does an incredible one. I always check it the TSA restrictions are so tricky. ": "Poppy",
  "I like to stay home with my family. But travel is good in a way. It makes you redefine each other each time you see each other. Also, it helps that I think my wife is the hottest woman in the world.": "Mads",
  "If I could travel back in time, I'd bring back the entire Wu-Tang Clan.": "Hannah",
  "I wouldn't call it a faux pas, but I have about 12 tracksuits. I always travel in a tracksuit. I feel it makes people happy when they see me.": "Jenny",
  "I do kabbalistic meditation. It's not unlike time travel it can change the past and not just the future. You can look at what was lost and go beyond the grief of what was lost. ": "Roseanne",
  "Travel is hard, but entertaining is joy.": "Debbie",
  "Terror, married to technology and accommodated by progress in travel, has turned evil individuals into traveling ballistic missiles.": "Greg",
  "There was a film that really affected me, 'La Strada' by Fellini, where Anthony Quinn and Giulietta Masina travel around on his little motorcycle thing.": "Kris",
  "Along with that ongoing process Sinn Fein took a decision to establish a peace commission which had the responsibility to travel around the country to receive submissions from the general public, also our opponents.": "Martin",
  "I was lucky enough to have it all. To be successful in business, to have children, to raise them on my own, and to travel and live my life. It was a lot of work, but it's a privilege to have been able to do it.": "Diane",
  "My pals, such as they are, in Hollywood, ask me why I love to travel to D.C. so much, why it's a vacation destination for me. I say, 'Because I sometimes have perfect days there.'": "Ben",
  "Space doesn't offer an escape from Earth's problems. And even with nuclear fuel, the transit time to nearby stars exceeds a human lifetime. Interstellar travel is therefore, in my view, an enterprise for post-humans, evolved from our species not via natural selection, but by design.": "Martin",
  "The first voyagers to the stars will be creatures whose life cycle is matched to the voyage: the aeons involved in traversing the galaxy are not daunting to immortal beings. By the end of the third millennium, travel to other stars could be technically feasible. But would there be sufficient motive?": "Martin",
  "With all the travel we're doing to cold-weather cities, your mind definitely starts to wander. It gets you away from the game. Even when you arrive in a city, you're tempted to just sit in your hotel and rest. Sometimes it's nice to just get out and walk around, to see what's there.": "Stephen",
  "I hope to play until I'm, like, 38 or something, and that's a lot of years in the game and a lot of travel and a lot of sacrifice on my family's part.": "Stephen",
  "When you travel so many weeks a year, it's always nice to have a home-cooked meal.": "Maria",
  "When I travel, I love speaking to women around the world about the things that inspire them, the fashions they like, what makes something good and what would make it even better.": "Maria",
  "I've been fortunate enough to travel the world because of my career, but the downside has been spending long spells apart from my daughters.": "Sean",
  "I've three children, three grandchildren, I work, I travel, and I'm very happily married. I'm very satisfied and happy with my life and there really isn't anything I want.": "Joan",
  "I think a major element of jetlag is psychological. Nobody ever tells me what time it is at home.": "David",
  "Building and launching rockets has been a lifelong hobby that my son and I share. We regularly travel to Nevada's Black Rock Desert to launch rockets.": "Steve",
  "But as far as being an American and loving this country and getting a chance to travel across it every day and meeting people on the road and folks in the military, I love this country on so many different levels.": "Dierks",
  "With Pakistan being in my blood, I would certainly look at opportunities to travel there.": "Nargis",
  "I was tall and skinny, and at 15, I was approached to model. I figured that models got to travel, and it became my ticket to travel so much so that if an agency could not fly me to another country, I would fly on my cost so that I could see that country and also make some money.": "Nargis",
  "Thanks to having my dad travel with me, I don't feel quite cut off from my family.": "Amy",
  "I do not own a car, and my main form of travel to Westminster and in my constituency is by bicycle. I also take my bike on trains to meetings in other parts of the country, which enables me to see other cities and the other parts of the country.": "Jeremy",
  "You can tell all our songs come from us and from our artists, the people we write with and travel with.": "Zac",
  "At my age, I only travel business class because I just don't bend anymore; my body can't cope with it.": "Peter",
  "I try to ensure my daughters are not spoilt. They are very aware of how lucky they are and appreciate it. We have had some lean years, so they know it's not all about luxury, travel, and hotels. They are grounded, and I'm grateful for that.": "David",
  "For years, I meant to read 'Arabian Sands', Wilfred Thesiger's account of two punishing camel journeys during the late 1940s across Southern Arabia's Empty Quarter. Now that I have, I can sheepishly join the chorus of those who revere the book as one of the half dozen greatest works of modern English travel writing.": "Michael",
  "Snowboarding's tough, because you've got to go to the mountains. For me, I love the skateboard season because I get to hangout at home and still be skating. I don't have to travel to Norway or Japan or these crazy places to be snowboarding.": "Shaun",
  "No veteran or active duty service member should endure a long hospital stay alone. Yet sadly, due to the high cost of travel, all too often our military families are separated while America's heroes receive care. Sometimes families sleep in hospital parking lots, unable to afford long stays in a hotel.": "John",
  "I love to travel. This is the time for me. When will I do it if not now?": "Rakul",
  "I took a gap year myself after high school and worked on a farm near Lyon, France. I stayed with the Vallet family, picked and packed fruit, and discovered that red wine can be a breakfast drink. That led to further travel as a university student.": "Nicholas",
  "I travel all the time. And as I go around the world, I try to learn a little something and not just take up all the available air.": "Kurt",
  "We travel a lot and don't get enough time to spend with our family, and so we have to take our pictures, videos, also bother about things like which are the HD quality phones. So I'm very much a part of these typical things.": "Yami",
  "After you pay your E-ZPass bill, there is no reason for the government to keep records of your travel.": "Adam",
  "It's sometimes tiring to get off a long-haul flight and go straight to the studio for a shoot, but if you really plan everything well, you can get so much out of combining travel with work.": "Alek",
  "The beauty of reading is that it lets you travel in a way you could never know.": "Alek",
  "I got to travel around Anbar Province, had a great group of Marines who worked for me who traveled around Anbar Province. I got to hang out with a lot of different types of Marines and soldiers and sailors.": "Phil",
  "I really enjoy what I do, and who I'm with and where I am. Having said that, I'm not really a person of habit, because what I do in my job is travel around the world and play concerts to people, and occasionally do very weird things.": "Robert",
  "No one working as an astronomer is shackled in chains. This is a tremendous profession. There are lots of neat people, and you get to do cool things. If I had to say something negative, it's that there's often a whole lot of travel that takes me away from my children. That can be a bummer a lot of times.": "Alan",
  "I have no idea what it would be like to be just one thing and speak one language. I feel enormously privileged to travel and be able to mingle and speak to people that, had I only known English, I wouldn't have been able to meet.": "Cary",
  "I lost all my investments after everything crashed in 2001. Prior to that, I'd been living off the interest on my investments, which was very healthy because it allowed frequent travel, and I had a lovely apartment.": "Marie",
  "If I'm on holiday, I travel light, but if it is a work trip, I take everything but the kitchen sink.": "Marie",
  "I literally wear a mask. When I take it off, I'm a father. I'm a husband. I like to come home, and I like to spend time with family, and I like to travel, and I like to have a good time. And I like to be a kid every now and giggle and play with my kids.": "Rey",
  "I run five miles three times a week I log everything. I look up routes when I travel. ": "Kevin",
  "I just see too many people retire and say, 'I'm going to take off, travel, spend time with my family' and they are just miserable. They end up dying. People who work and stay active, and like what they are doing, live longer.": "Terry",
  "To build my legacy and be that person I want to be, this is what it's going to take: to get on the road and travel. Let's do it that way.": "Deontay",
  "The future continues to preoccupy me as a reliable source of hopes, fears and anxieties, but increasingly the present seems to have no outstanding qualities of its own, being merely a way-station through which events travel to the vast shadow lands of the past.": "Will",
  "The first book I did - the first successful book - was a kind of a travel book, and publishers in Britain encouraged me to do more.": "Bill",
  "I understand more when I travel why people believe that the French are arrogant.": "Jean-Michel",
  "Startups, in some sense, have gotten so easy to start that we are confusing two things. And what we are confusing, often, is, 'How far can you get in your first day of travel?' with, 'How long it is going to take to get up to the top of the mountain?'": "Mitch",
  "News seems to travel far more quickly on Twitter and Facebook than through search.": "Marvin",
  "Data can generally travel the speed of light unless networks are congested. When there's congestion, usually the cheapest and best thing is simply to add capacity generally, not to prioritize certain sites over others.": "Marvin",
  "Yes, I travel in unusual circles. George Osborne and his wife Frances are my cousins.": "Daryl",
  "Among the various vernaculars that are spoken in different parts of India, there is one that stands out strongly from the rest, as that which is most widely known. It is Hindi. A man who knows Hindi can travel over India and find everywhere Hindi-speaking people.": "Annie",
  "When I thought I was retired, I wanted to travel around the world and watch soccer games.": "Drew",
  "In general, when you travel, you get into a different reality and are able to more accurately reflect on your ordinary life. Hiking does that for me.": "John",
  "I love my cooking tools because I enjoy cooking - a Vitamix for smoothies and a rice cooker for steel-cut oats. I travel with a small rice cooker. I soak oats overnight, and when I get up, I just turn the rice cooker on, and it cooks the oats perfectly every time.": "John",
  "Air travel is the safest form of travel aside from walking; even then, the chances of being hit by a public bus at 30,000 feet are remarkably slim. I also have no problem with confined spaces. Or heights. What I am afraid of is speed.": "Sloane",
  "People who might normally have to travel hours to a distant city to see a cardiologist can now do so virtually, through Cisco technology, at their local hospital or health clinic. Clinicians use technology to share patient reports and diagnostic images and collaborate on cases.": "John",
  "I have been lucky enough to travel a lot, meet great people in many lands. I have liked almost everyone I met along the way.": "Maeve",
  "Ball caps travel far and wide. They do far more than keep the sun out of your eyes or the cold off your head. Ball caps are a statement.": "George",
  "No matter where I travel in the state, people want to talk about education.": "James",
  "Don't get me wrong, I love watching episodes of my favorite shows on Hulu and reading the daily trash on PageSix, but I also embrace the opportunity to settle down with a good book and let my mind travel to another place and time.": "Rachel",
  "We are ramping up security in the United States but also looking at visa applicants, visa waiver applicants - and looking at travel manifests on the airplanes trying to come into the United States.": "Mike",
  "It's one thing for someone to travel over to Syria and Iraq and come back. But, boy, it's a lot easier if they activate someone who's already here.": "Mike",
  "On Sundays, we would travel to the town and watch English movies. This way, we must have ended up watching some 1,000 movies during college.": "Shiv",
  "Of all possible subjects, travel is the most difficult for an artist, as it is the easiest for a journalist.": "W.",
  "It doesn't require much thought for one to realise that any travel book worthy of the name has to be a departure from the standard idea of the form.": "Geoff",
  "I considered becoming a priest very seriously. I wanted to travel the world. By the time I turned 16, I realized I was only in it for selfish reasons. And, more importantly, I didn't want to sacrifice the ladies!": "James",
  "I actually think some of my best moments in life have been while I was with people from Instagram - whether it's super late nights getting a release out or being able to travel to places I'd never visited and meeting some of the most interesting people I've ever met.": "Kevin",
  "I coach soccer, and my wife and I are very involved in our kids' lives. Our family is busy with doctor appointments, soccer practice, school, work, travel, vacation... life.": "Patrick",
  "From a pretty early age, my mother realized that I was a little bit more gifted and talented than my own age group. So, she moved me over to play with the boys' travel soccer team when I was about 11 years old.": "Abby",
  "All this misjudgment that we have of each other is based on ignorance. The second you get to travel, you see that human beings, no matter where they come from, they are the same.": "Marjane",
  "We link our future to the euro, to the euro zone, and to the European Union while being the nearest neighbor of the United Kingdom with, obviously, a common travel area and a very close working relationship with the U.K.": "Enda",
  "I had to travel into the future and direct 'Jurassic World' as myself in 20 years - and I did.": "Colin",
  "And now I have a big house, nice clothes and I travel in first class and I love it, so maybe it's time to enjoy being a star.": "Vincent",
  "I really encourage people to travel so we can see how the rest of the world views our country. That's really important. Secondly, as artists, activists, and citizens who vote, we have to begin to vote from our heart.": "Michael",
  "The world is a country which nobody ever yet knew by description one must travel through it one's self to be acquainted with it. ": "Philip",
  "I've thought it would be cool to have a baby young. You know, be my road dog - like my dogs, they travel the world - but there's always something you have to give up for success. Everything comes at a cost. Just what are you willing to pay for it?": "Serena",
  "I have a couple of go-to sneakers off the pitch. I like to have shoes that I can slip on and wear with anything. I travel often, so it's about finding those two or three pairs of shoes that can go with any outfit, whether they go with leggings or a skirt or a dress or jeans.": "Alex",
  "For a long time, our only mode of travel was an Econoline van. Eleven of us, with nine sleeping in the back on two mattresses.": "Butch",
  "Oh, I'm terrible at travel.": "Johnny",
  "Travel for me is all about transformation, and I'm fascinated by those people who really do come back from a trip unrecognizable to themselves and perhaps open to the same possibilities they'd have written off not a month before.": "Pico",
  "I think writing is really about a journey of understanding. So you take something that seems very far away, and the more you write about it, the more you travel into it, and you see it from within.": "Pico",
  "I think one reason, obviously, that I spend so much time in one place is that I've been lucky enough to travel a lot, and now there are other different, invisible trains that are more interesting to me.": "Pico",
  "We all know how we can be turned around by a magic place; that's why we travel, often. And yet we all know, too, that the change cannot be guaranteed. Travel is a fool's paradise, Emerson reminded us, if we think that we can find anything far off that we could not find at home.": "Pico",
  "Being in a band is like a small family. You travel together, make music, and share time with each other.": "Mohit",
  "Young people should travel, and they don't. You can't know if you don't go.": "Quincy",
  "I travel like a maniac. I travel more than anyone I know. I love learning the languages.": "Quincy",
  "I lived in Italy for two months when I was in college. And I traveled to Paris. I traveled to Egypt. I traveled to Spain. I just would travel a lot. I remember going to Paris and saying, speaking French, 'I would like some chicken and some fries.' And just the chicken and fries was, oh my gosh, just so amazing. I became intrigued and inspired.": "Tia",
  "I've been all over the world on my own because, as a scientist, you travel a great deal if your work is reasonably successful or published. I get invitations to go to all sorts of strange countries where I would mostly be by myself and just meet other people there, instead of having travelling companions.": "Robert",
  "America has the best hand ever dealt to any country on this planet, ever. Yes, we have problems, but you travel around the world, you'll see we have it all.": "Jamie",
  "I started to travel like this at the age of 15 so for me, it's normal. Some days you get tired and you feel, 'I want to stay at home a little bit more,' but it's only the moment.": "Rafael",
  "There is no budget for travel for a Shadow Foreign Secretary.": "William",
  "The Internet is part of our evolution. The mystics used to say, 'We can travel across the planet in a thought.' Now we really can. We can be connected with a million people at a time.": "Forest",
  "I think every day how incredibly lucky it is that I travel around the world playing to thousands of people.": "Bernard",
  "Tyga's one of my best friends ever, so it's so much fun to travel with him. I always like having my friends out on the road with me.": "Kylie",
  "I want to go to college to study journalism. I want to speak French fluently, to travel. My mom was a journalist and it's in my blood.": "Mandy",
  "Interesting things come your way but as you get older, your lifestyle changes. I don't want to travel; I don't want to be in a hotel room away from my family.": "Gary",
  "There are so many things I want to do. Like, I want to get an artist, a musician, a photographer, and a bunch of dancers that I know and just travel across Africa and just film it and just see what happens. Do and learn as much as I possibly can. Luckily, I have a lot more time.": "Channing",
  "I travel a lot and rarely make it home to Seattle.": "Hope",
  "I wish more Americans would travel here. I always encourage my friends: 'Travel. See the Middle East. There's so much to see, so many good people.' And it's vice versa, and it helps stop problems of misunderstanding and stereotypes from happening.": "Maz",
  "Anyone who's gotten their passport in America will tell you, when you get it, it still says what country you were born in. So I remember getting my American passport. I was like, 'Woo-hoo! I'm going to travel.' And I opened it up. It said, 'Born in Iran.' I'm like, 'Oh, come on, man!'": "Maz",
  "My family went to Toronto to visit relatives when I was 13 or 14. It was the first time we had ever been abroad. This was the early Eighties, and I remember the impossible glamour of air travel - my mum spending days trying to decide what she was going to wear on the plane.": "John",
  "I get cold - really cold - when I travel.": "Laura",
  "Look how far the human race has come in terms of air and space travel in the last hundred years. So in the next couple of thousand years, you've got to believe that we're going to be able to do all kinds of amazing things.": "Chris",
  "I try and work out as often as possible. Since I travel very often, it becomes very difficult to have a daily work out routine, but I practice yoga every day or try and play some sport. Also, I am very aware of what suits my body in terms of food and exercise.": "Deepika",
  "I've always believed that as actors, one of the biggest advantages of being in the film business - not just of being actors, but being in this industry - is the fact that you get to travel so much, and you get to see places that you probably would not if you went just as a tourist.": "Deepika",
  "I don't like hobbies. I read and travel and see my friends before they disown me.": "Ruth",
  "Furloughing a bunch of air traffic controllers has a pretty easy-to-predict effect on air travel: It causes delays.": "Alex",
  "I like to watch Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern, because I like them when they travel. I like Ina Garten, 'The Barefoot Contessa.' Giada is really nice, but I get a little bit bored with just staying in the kitchen.": "Debi",
  "I was a huge Beatles fan. We could talk about who I listened to growing up and what my sources were, but certainly the Beatles were a late, important resource for me, and I just took my guitar and a handful of songs, and I decided, well, I'll just go over and travel around Europe and see what comes of it.": "James",
  "The myth-making about Appomattox started from the moment Lee left the courthouse on his horse to travel to Richmond.": "Douglas",
  "I do this system called TRX. It was developed by a Navy SEAL and is basically a simple cord that you can wrap around something anywhere, anytime, and you use your body weight as resistance. We installed one in our home gym, but you can also attach it to a tree. It's very easy to travel with.": "Elizabeth",
  "My job is to be a spokesman - the spokesman, I suppose - for the President, for the White House, to do the daily briefings, to manage the press corps in terms of travel, day-to-day needs, access, interviews, all those issues.": "Dee",
  "Americans aren't good at accents, but the English are because their accents change. You go five or six blocks and the accent is different, so they are used to hearing different pitches. In America, you gotta travel maybe 10 states before you can really hear a difference.": "Nick",
  "I've gotten very cynical and kind of anhedonic about all the things I have to do to get to do comedy: all the travel, hotels, and airports.": "Patton",
  "I travel all over the world, usually 10 months out of the year. I stay at a lot of hotels, and the ones I like best are clean and not complicated. You go to bed and say, 'Wow, I feel comfortable.'": "Nobu",
  "When I travel too much, it affects the music, and that is the most important thing. As long as I make good music, I can play shows, but if the music starts getting bad, the show offers won't come.": "Kygo",
  "In between films I like to travel and hope to visit every continent before I become a mother.": "Diane",
  "'Naked' kind of kicked me off into the film world. It just so happens that all of the things that I have been offered have been films, and I've enjoyed the travel that goes along with that.": "David",
  "I fly economy. I do often fly first class, but I don't travel with a posse, or bodyguard, or an assistant.": "Gene",
  "I am humbled and excited by new opportunities for me to support and share the amazing work NASA is doing to help us travel farther into the solar system and work with the next generation of science and technology leaders.": "Scott",
  "There are few aspects of everyday life that aren't touched by the technologies developed for space travel.": "Scott",
  "I'm such a girl for the living room. I really like to stay in my nest and not move. I travel in my mind, and that that's a rigorous state of journeying for me. My body isn't that interested in moving from place to place.": "bell",
  "Beauty, pleasure, freedom and plenty of sleep: these are the hallmarks of a successful idler's break. Travel should not be hard work.": "Tom",
  "I love to take risks, I love to travel, and I'm very outdoor-sy, so any girl who can pick up a football and throw a spiral will definitely catch my attention.": "Kellan",
  "As far as 'Twilight' goes, I'm in love with my character. I'm in love with the whole series. I love doing the fan conventions around the world, I love to travel. So wherever it fits in, I'd love to continue doing that for the rest of my life. Just meeting the fans who made everything possible from around the world.": "Kellan",
  "Everywhere I travel around my home state of Wyoming - but also around the country - I continue to hear, 'How can Washington make us buy something we don't want to buy, a product? They can't tell us to buy breakfast cereal or something else - how can they do that?'": "John",
  "I travel the world, and I can see in Toronto the cooking is very personal. These people cook with their hearts.": "Alain",
  "If I had the choice to travel to two places in Europe, it would be Paris and London.": "Alain",
  "Given the number of restaurants I have, I could easily travel all the time - but I try not to.": "Alain",
  "I loved working on 'Happy Gilmore' because I love to travel to new places and we got to go to British Columbia. Any Adam Sandler film is fun to work on because it is a reunion of the boys club of guys that have worked together in the past.": "Kevin",
  "I never get enough sleep, even when I travel. I wake up in the middle of the night, either with the help of my kids or because my mind is going. I wish I got eight hours a night, but it is more like an interrupted six or seven. The secret is to go to sleep well before midnight.": "Summer",
  "I love to run, but training can be hard, especially with a family and a crazy travel schedule. I often do sprints with my kids, where they bike and I run along side them so we can 'race' each other for a quarter-mile or shorter repeats.": "Summer",
  "I love to not work. I like to travel. I work maybe half the year, no more.": "Catherine",
  "Unfortunately, I'm more experienced than I care to admit on long-distance relationships. Just because that is my life. I travel because I love to. As a result, I have to sort of make it work when a relationship kind of comes into view.": "Hunter",
  "Modeling isn't really a tough job. Acting is much harder: so much prep and changing your look and mannerisms. It's a more difficult lifestyle being a model. I traveled all the time. Although, now I wonder, because I travel all the time for acting, too. So they both have their difficulties.": "Olga",
  "The truth is, I never travel without cash. I always take a few tens with me in case of an emergency. There's never been an emergency, and in time, I realized that Americans don't want to touch customers' dirty bills. They also don't want to touch your credit card: you have to put it through the machine yourself, with your own fingers.": "Sayed",
  "If you look at human society, it is very easy, of course, to compare our warfare and territoriality with the chimpanzee. But that's only one side of what we do. We also trade, we intermarry, we allow each other to travel through our territory. There's an enormous amount of cooperation.": "Frans",
  "I travel all the time.": "Guy",
  "Each day as I travel through downtown Tucson, I am amazed at how quickly the most ancient of human behaviors have changed. For as long as there have been Homo sapiens - roughly 200,000 years - people have filled their lives principally with two activities: talking directly with other people, and doing physical things.": "Andrew",
  "Fiction leaves us so much work to do, allows the individual so much input; you have to see, you have to hear, you have to taste the madeleine, and while you are seemingly passive in your chair, you have to travel.": "Hilary",
  "I grew up in Harlem in New York, very rough, urban environment, and so what I found is that, if I can have kids travel to different places, countries, areas, it can expand their minds.": "Ving",
  "The photograph reverses the purpose of travel, which until now had been to encounter the strange and unfamiliar.": "Marshall",
  "My 'go to' workout is called the Asylum from Beach Body. It's intense training with lots of intervals, core work. It's hard! I travel a lot, so I can take it on the road with me and do it in a hotel room.": "Apolo",
  "My father is 100% Japanese and came to the United States when he was only 18 years old. My grandmother still resides in Japan, which has allowed me to travel to the roots of my ancestors with my father.": "Apolo",
  "I was told by so many people that I wouldn't succeed because I was too different. Ironically, the very reason that people watch my channel and travel thousands of miles to see a show... is because it's different. God didn't send us to Earth to just blend in. We are here to share what makes us unique.": "Lindsey",
  "Radical Islamic jihadists have a long-term vision. And if they have to stay in Europe to obtain a citizenship, to ultimately travel to the United States, and if it takes them five years or ten years, they're okay with that. History has proven that.": "Jeff",
  "Traveling, you realize that differences are lost: each city takes to resembling all cities, places exchange their form, order, distances, a shapeless dust cloud invades the continents.": "Italo",
  "When I write, I'm still imagining a kid reading it on paper. I read e-books when I travel, but in general I still prefer holding an old-fashioned book in my hands. There's a special, tactile experience.": "Rick",
  "I've always liked the idea that writing is a form of travel. And I started my writing career as a mystery novelist for adults.": "Rick",
  "I live a good life but a pretty simply life. I just store all my money under my mattress. My wife and I travel, and I bought my dream car, the Cobra.": "Aaron",
  "Mr. Trump of course feels sorry for what the Khan family has gone through, just, frankly, as he felt sorry for the victims that spoke before the Republican Convention who lost loved ones from illegal immigrant criminals coming in and being able to travel the country freely.": "Paul",
  "My school didn't have a drama department. I was one of the lucky four children who got to travel twice a week to another school because our school could only afford one taxi.": "Richard",
  "Good Viking genes, being vegetarian and having rowdy dogs and kids definitely keep me in shape. Not eating meat gives me the energy I need to keep up with work, family and travel - I'm very active.": "Pamela",
  "Fashion pictures show people looking glamorous. Travel pictures show a place looking at its best, nothing to do with the reality. In the cookery pages, the food always looks amazing, right? Most of the pictures we consume are propaganda.": "Martin",
  "As we travel around Britain, I am convinced most of us cannot really appreciate what we are seeing. We take too much for granted, because it is all so familiar.": "Martin",
  "By default, I am a travel photographer. I work on a combination of commissions and personal projects that take me around the world.": "Martin",
  "For those aspiring to make a living from travel photography, it's a sad fact that the boring shots are the shots that are going to make you money.": "Martin",
  "In this life, you should read everything you can read. Taste everything you can taste. Meet everyone you can meet. Travel everywhere you can travel. Learn everything you can learn. Experience everything you can experience.": "Mario",
  "I stepped away to find out more about myself, which I was having difficulty doing as a football player. I got a chance to travel the world. I studied Eastern philosophy, and I've grown as a person so much.": "Ricky",
  "Texts and e-mails travel no faster than phone calls and telegrams, and their content isn't necessarily richer or poorer.": "Alison",
  "I always try to travel light.": "Claire",
  "I travel a lot. I'm on the move.": "Ted",
  "I sit here as the first African-American attorney general, serving the first African-American President of the United States. And that has to show that we have made a great deal of progress. But there's still more we have to travel along this road so we get to the place that is consistent with our founding ideals.": "Eric",
  "There's an image that some of us have of Jackie Onassis, stepping out in the rain, and Maurice Tempelsman is holding her umbrella. We want that man. We want the man to be the concierge and the masseur and the travel booker.": "Sandra",
  "From a pretty early age, I developed an interest in travel. I told my parents I wanted to live abroad, and they said, 'Well, you have to have money to do those things.'": "Aileen",
  "What I like about modelling is that it has given me that opportunity to travel and experience different cultures, work with creative people, and now it's given me a voice, and with that voice hopefully I can do good things with it.": "Miranda",
  "There was never any question that I would go to college, that I would travel, that I would go to the theater early and often.": "Harold",
  "The bottom line is, if you're pregnant, don't travel to an area where Zika is spreading.": "Tom",
  "The first case of Ebola diagnosed in the United States has caused some to call on the United States to ban travel for anyone from the countries in West Africa facing the worst of the Ebola epidemic. That response is understandable. It's only human to want to protect ourselves and our families.": "Tom",
  "I'm obsessed with Nicholas Sparks. I've literally read every single book, because every time I travel, at the airport, I always buy a new Nicholas Sparks book.": "Emma",
  "The trains that travel the Chunnel are massive machines. The Eurostars are bullet-shaped and a quarter-mile long. They are pulled by a 136,000-pound locomotive and move in the open air at 185 m.p.h. and through the tunnel at 100 m.p.h.": "Peter",
  "When I was 17, my main goal was to be in a band and travel the world. I ended up getting to do that with my old band Hey Monday. I got to see the world and learn how to tour, and the next thing I knew, I was on 'The Voice.' So it was just a crazy, crazy ride.": "Cassadee",
  "I travel around the world constantly promoting my projects and endorsing products. Yes, I do get paid to go to parties; in fact, I'm the person who started the whole trend of paid appearances. But when you see me at a party, I'm always working or promoting something.": "Paris",
  "When I go on Japanese Airlines, I really love it because I like Japanese food.": "Phil",
  "There's this group online that I frequent. It's a group of prop crazies just like me called the Replica Props Forum, and it's people who trade, make and travel in information about movie props.": "Adam",
  "When we set out our original program from the beginning, obviously our markets were pretty limited, and we were thinking about them mostly as U.S. shows, and they would travel like other U.S. shows have.": "Ted",
  "Most people travel with a good book, but I also keep my agenda with me; I'll flip through the pages and take a few moments to organize my life a little - I rarely get the time to do this normally.": "Carolina",
  "I didn't have any expectations of what my family life would end up being like. But I've been very blessed in my life to have a wife who loves me and supports me and is able to be in my band and travel with me.": "Josh",
  "My first full year of touring, I did 300 days on the road. That was not including the travel time or publicity or anything else - that was just dates. I was home probably less than 50 days that year.": "Josh",
  "We travel so much as touring musicians and artists that sometimes, when you hear a great song that you really think could be on your project, you go ahead and record it instead of try to write it.": "Jon",
  "I think having toured the world and seeing many places, I've just been blown away by how we've really scarred our home. I'm as guilty as the next person if not more so. I travel a lot. The damage we do to our planet is huge.": "James",
  "I'm always ready for the enemy to come over the hill. I'm packed and set to go. That comes from my time in the army. I used to travel in a tank, but now it's a tour bus going to safer places.": "James",
  "Not everything in old age is grim. I haven't walked through an airport for years, and wheelchairs are the way to travel.": "Donald",
  "I'm vegan on home base, but when I travel to other countries, I throw it all into the garbage.": "Lake",
  "I think part of what I love about being an actor is getting to take on different worlds and investigate different genres and travel to different lands.": "Lake",
  "I've always been a big fan of time travel, and I'm very into the notion that some day we'll be able to do it. Beam me up!": "Scott",
  "I hope that I'll be hot for a long time so I can make a lot of money, I can retire early, and just travel. Hopefully that will happen.": "Kristin",
  "I live in Chicago, but my work is always in New York or L.A., so I always have to travel for my job.": "Kristin",
  "I love the idea that if you're going to travel through time, you do it in this insanely dangerous car travelling at 88 miles per hour.": "Ryan",
  "I was destined to work with dying patients. I had no choice when I encountered my first AIDS patient. I felt called to travel some 250,000 miles each year to hold workshops that helped people cope with the most painful aspects of life, death and the transition between the two.": "Elisabeth",
  "Horror movies travel pretty well anyway. They're like action movies: People overseas can watch them and enjoy them, and they're not so culturally specific in terms of their references, and they can follow a good scary story.": "Robert",
  "Death by plane crash scares me. I travel a lot, and when you hit turbulence, and post 9/11, that's in the back of my mind a bit.": "Robert",
  "Even with protection, even with death threats, I can publish, I can travel and I can live the life that I want and not the one my parents want or some imam somewhere thinks I should live.": "Ayaan",
  "I always want to give my best and do the best I can. I know when I have sung my best and when I haven't. There can be stresses and hassles with time travel and press attention. I just have to adapt and find a way of dealing with it.": "Katherine",
  "In Heaven, I believe my dad is somewhere doing something nice. I feel I've been too lucky to travel this far without somebody guiding me.": "Katherine",
  "It's shocking to think about how little the travel industry cares about sustainability - and it's the basis of their business!": "Jochen",
  "We may regard the solar systems as separate sponges, swimming in a World of Divine Spirit, and thus it will be apparent that in order to travel from one solar system to another, it would be necessary to be able to function consciously in the highest vehicle of man, the Divine Spirit.": "Max",
  "I think all regions have had their peculiarities of speech rounded off by television, radio, and people travel so much more now.": "Daniel",
  "All the rappers my age are getting Audemars and Rolexes. I want to find my own thing. That's why I travel the world - for me, that's my B-side, why we go places. I have a Hublot on from time to time but I want a home base watch - something that's elegant but has got a little pizzazz to it.": "Wale",
  "My first experiences of Colorado travel have been rather severe. At Greeley, I got a small upstairs room at first, but gave it up to a married couple with a child, and then had one downstairs no bigger than a cabin, with only a canvas partition. It was very hot, and every place was thick with black flies.": "Isabella",
  "I particularly like to travel for work because you see a completely different side of the country you're visiting.": "Philip",
  "The growth of purposeful travel is a good thing. It can have a positive impact. We should continue to experiment and move along this line.": "Joe",
  "Travel is an exercise partly in broadening yourself and partly in defining your own limits.": "Andrew",
  "I started traveling out of curiosity, but I have come to believe in travel's political importance, that encouraging a nation's citizenry to travel may be as important as encouraging school attendance, environmental conservation, or national thrift. You cannot understand the otherness of places you have not encountered.": "Andrew",
  "You can't expect the entire world to come to New York to see you. You have to travel to them.": "Theodore",
  "I realized I couldn't have one foot in the fiction world and one foot in the nonfiction world, which is why 'Here I Go Again' is so not me. I didn't graduate from high school in the '90s, I never listened to metal music, and I don't time travel.": "Jen",
  "Michael Palin decided to give up on his considerable comedy talents to make those dreadfully tedious travel shows. Have you ever tried to watch one?": "John",
  "Touring can be tough; the crew and I travel everywhere by a big pink bus, and live in petrol stations.": "Marina",
  "I'm a 'tweener,' man! I couldn't march with Dr. King and them. And I'm too old to be a hip-hopper. But I've been granted honorary status in each generation... I see my tongue as a bridge over which ideas can travel back and forth.": "Michael",
  "Big climbs energize me. It's all the other aspects of being a pro-climber that wear me down. The travel and expeditions and training can become pretty tiring. But the actual big climbs - that's what I live for.": "Alex",
  "I travel around and hear from so many kids. Their parents say they were always very picky but they watch the show and they want to try stuff. The show is entertainment, but I think it has done so much for the public perception of what food can be.": "Tom",
  "Since I travel so much, it's always great to be home. There's nothing like getting to raid my own refrigerator at two in the morning.": "Amy",
  "Being in the pop group Eternal gave me the most wonderful opportunity to travel the world, and I have visited some spectacular countries.": "Louise",
  "The genre has moved into this commercial aspect of itself, and ignored this extraordinarily rich literature that's filed everywhere else except under travel.": "Robyn",
  "The truth is I'm not really interested in travel writing as it's generally conceived, and even less so in female travel writing.": "Robyn",
  "Every congresswoman surely endures the same strains that drive some of her male colleagues to have affairs: lots of travel, families far away, heady work that makes a domestic routine seem distant and boring. But the stakes are much higher for women, because they are still judged by a different standard.": "Hanna",
  "Once you're in a room like '30 Rock,' it's a creative setting, so you write more even after you go home, just because you're still in that mode of coming up with jokes. So the job wasn't sapping standup jokes, but it was sapping stand up time and energy, and I wouldn't be able to travel as much.": "Hannibal",
  "I think that you certainly don't have to be aged and travel the world to write a poem.": "Rita",
  "In a certain sense, a writer is an exile, an outsider, always reporting on things, and it is part of his life to keep on the move. Travel is natural.": "James",
  "I love anywhere new and different. That's the fun of travel. I've always loved driving through Spain, France and Italy - sometimes in an Alfa Spider.": "Rory",
  "I've always traveled, as a kid my parents moved me around, a different place in Germany every four years. But I got the travel bug when I was a kid, living in different countries.": "Dominic",
  "I've been fortunate enough to write a book and travel the country to sign and sell it, so I can safely say that a five-second burst of conversation while you're scribbling your name, over and over, is not the most reliable way to bond with Americans.": "Gwen",
  "I hate to travel. I don't go anywhere.": "Ingmar",
  "The idea of making access to safe abortions harder and more expensive and more difficult, having to travel across state lines - that puts women's health and lives in jeopardy, which is something I think no one wants.": "Cynthia",
  "The Nike Fuel Band is interesting - it measures your movements and how far you've walked and how hard you've worked that day. I prefer using when I travel. It's a fun way to see how far I've walked - how many steps I've taken when I'm walking around different cities.": "Andrew",
  "I travel a lot, and that makes it harder to date, but it also opens up opportunities for me to meet people where I wouldn't normally meet them.": "Cameron",
  "I travel fairly lightly because you have to these days. I always take a laptop and an iPod so I can watch movies and listen to music. And my Gameboy. That's a good time-killer.": "Bill",
  "In my 20s, as I began to travel in Europe, I found comfort in religious paintings. Even though my own belief in Catholic dogma had been shaken and weakened, I found that the beauty and the richness of the art still held me.": "Colm",
  "Eating well was something I learned as I started to be successful and had to travel and perform concerts, which are an intense cardio workout.": "Curtis",
  "Because travel has always been such a vital part of myself and so essential to who I am, I have made the decision to continue to put myself back out into the world. And that's not an easy decision to make.": "Amanda",
  "Getting on a plane is hard for me, but I do it, because travel is vital to me.": "Amanda",
  "I don't like to travel. Yet all my books seem to involve a journey.": "Chris",
  "The railroads needed standardized time; as a result, the technology of train travel shaped the way everyone gets up, eats, goes to sleep, calculates age, and, perhaps of no small importance, imagine the world as a whole, ticking reliably, with reliable deviations, according to the beat of one central clock in a physical location.": "Stacey",
  "As a child I sometimes used to travel to the West Bank to visit my family, so I know what the checkpoints felt like. I knew what it was like to live under occupation.": "Queen",
  "I try to travel as light as possible to avoid baggage issues. Los Angeles airport is notorious for baggage delays, so I'll often FedEx a suitcase ahead or back so I don't need to stand around; it also minimises problems at check-in.": "Kyle",
  "You don't have to travel, but I find extended travel to be a helpful tool for reexamining yourself and the constraints you've artificially placed on your life. It's easy to believe everything has to be done one way if you're always in one place around the same people.": "Timothy",
  "I knew from the first moment I picked up a camera, on my first school assignment, what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I was going to find a way to travel the world and tell the stories of the people I met through photographs.": "Mary",
  "During prom season, I travel around the country with a 20-by-24 camera - which is logistically complicated - and photograph proms. My husband made a film of it.": "Mary",
  "When I travel with my kids abroad, I am not myself, but I'm more a father who wants to protect them. Sometimes, I am even aggressive about certain things and get surprised seeing myself like that: for instance, when people want to take pictures of them. I am fine if they want to take my pictures, but they are not public property.": "A.",
  "Being able to travel the world is pretty cool. There are places that I've always wanted to go to but being able to go there as somebody who's a musician and is recognised as one is cool.": "Tinie",
  "Travel books are, by and large, boring. They lodge uncomfortably between fact, fiction and autobiography.": "Arthur",
  "Occasionally I find a travel book that is both illuminating and entertaining, where vivid writing and research replace self-indulgence and sloppy prose.": "Arthur",
  "Don Quixote's 'Delusions' is an excellent read - far better than my own forthcoming travel book, 'Walking Backwards Across Tuscany.'": "Arthur",
  "Scoring goals is the best feeling you can have. I always look up at the stand for my family straight afterwards it means everything to me that they travel to every game. ": "Frank",
  "There are always things I find difficult - being in crowds, remembering faces. I do like routines. I always travel with someone. My life in Avignon is a very quiet one. I have an apartment that looks over the whole city. I can drop into town, but a lot of the time I write from home. In some respects I still live a very quiet, simple life.": "Daniel",
  "In the spring of 1968, The Beatles and I were invited by Maharishi Mahesh Yogi to travel to Riskikesh, India. Riskikesh has been an important spiritual place to many millions of people over the years. It is situated where the Ganges River flows out of the Himalayas, and to be in that atmosphere was something incredibly special.": "Mike",
  "With all the stuff that's going on in the world - after I watch the news, read the news, and listen to my podcasts, at the end of the day, am I really going to watch an episode of murder and time travel?": "Betty",
  "I certainly have routines in my day-to-day life that are important to me and still give me feelings of security and control, but the capacity to break out of them every so often as I travel has given me a second wind.": "Daniel",
  "Nobody controls me. I travel with my husband when I can, when I know that I can go, and I know that my son is okay alone for a few days with the help.": "Melania",
  "Those are the kinds of roles you can really sink your teeth into. Characters with an edge. When you're playing someone who's sort of seedy, there's less limitation, there's so much space you can travel. There's room to move in.": "Matt",
  "We take so many of our freedoms for granted nowadays - I can travel where I like, I can have a baby when I like, I can do any job I want - but I do think chivalry has been lost a little bit.": "Dan",
  "'What comes next?' is the constant question I'm asked by outsiders eager to travel to the island. During the eleven years I traveled to Havana, very few Cubans I met on the island ever bothered to verbalize this question.": "Brin-Jonathan",
  "For years, I had no time for exploratory travel.": "Renee",
  "Having to travel so much plays havoc with your personal life.": "Renee",
  "I am always exhausted; I am always trying to find more time to be with my family, which is why they travel with me so much.": "John",
  "Everyone carries his own inch rule of taste, and amuses himself by applying it, triumphantly, wherever he travels.": "Henry",
  "I hate to travel with stuff.": "Manolo",
  "I've always been into visual effects. It was something I took keen interest in before films happened. Ironically, I am a part of 'Raaz 3,' a film that is shot entirely on 3D. It has encouraged me to pursue my dream. Hopefully, if time permits, I will travel to the United States and attend a crash course in visual graphics and animation.": "Emraan",
  "I live in a Moomin house in East London which I fill with blankets and nice crockery and get people round for dinner. When you travel a lot, you feel rootless and adrift - this is my sanctuary, where I can breathe out.": "Bat",
  "If you play the same club every week of every month, it's kind of boring. It's great that you can play one night in Brazil and one night in Japan, one night in Europe, and see the world. It's amazing what you see if you travel around the world.": "Tiesto",
  "You must know that Iran has a great number of productions. Many films are released. Most of them, like in the rest of the world, are commercial and shallow films. These are the most popular ones. And there are a few ones that actually develop more profound and thoughtful aspects of life. Only some of these films travel out of Iran.": "Asghar",
  "I like playing tennis. I've always enjoyed the process of being a tennis player; I'm just not sure that I enjoyed the travel at the end, and my body didn't recover from the day-to-day grind.": "Andy",
  "It's a very immersive and intense form of travel to walk around with an interpreter and stop random people on the street and ask them about their lives.": "Brandon",
  "We all become great explorers during our first few days in a new city, or a new love affair.": "Mignon",
  "I never travel without my Stetson, but the more I wear it the more I realise that no one wears hats any more. When I was a kid everybody wore hats, especially in Texas, but I get off the plane in Dallas now and I'm the only guy with a hat. It's amazing.": "Larry",
  "Touch seems to be such an important tool for enhancing social cooperation and affiliation that we have evolved a special physical route along which those subliminal feelings of social connection travel from skin to brain.": "Leonard",
  "My father's plan was, we were going to grow up and travel the world.": "Philippe",
  "I travel all over the country speaking to young people, and I am always amazed at how engaged in environmental conservation they are.": "Philippe",
  "I've said before, the number one thing that we have to work on is protecting the gay community from sharia law. Now, in the United States, it's probably not a big issue right now, but my brother-in-law is gay, and his partner and I would like them to be able to travel any place in the world without them risking harm.": "Foster",
  "I want my life to match my work now. I don't want to work and then travel. I want to be at one place.": "Sarita",
  "Our career is a dream. I mean, we get to act, travel around the world, and meet cool people. What's not to love!": "Mary-Kate",
  "Doing Shakespeare once is not fair to the play. I have been in Shakespeare plays when it's not until the last two or three performances when I even understand certain things. In the old days star actors would travel the world doing the same parts over and over again.": "Al",
  "Chess has given me a lot more than I could ask for. I have been able to feel special, travel the world and do what I truly enjoy. Moreover, chess players love being their own boss and hate having to wake up early!": "Viswanathan",
  "The good news is that real-world hands-on conservation is alive and well and catching on across the America I travel.": "Ted",
  "When I travel abroad, because I'm Columbian, I'm always one that they check twice and security and I'm the one that they open my bag and the one they pull to the side to check the visa.": "Sofia",
  "I remember returning to Bangalore after a few months of travel and seeing it as a first-world city, like New York or San Francisco. This may be obvious to some people, but I grew up in Delhi, and I had no experience of how someone from a 'Tier 2' city may view a 'Tier 1' city. You really do emigrate between worlds when you come from those towns.": "Karan",
  "I've been lucky enough to travel widely. When you're based in Europe, it's very easy to go to Madrid or Budapest for the weekend. I also lived in Italy for ten years and now live in Ireland.": "Laurie",
  "If you travel 11 months a year - from one dangerous or isolated situation to the next - if you live in hotels, and every relationship with another human being is a two-week relationship, the only other people who have any idea what you're going through or how strung out you are are other photographers.": "Rick",
  "I find Facebook absolutely fascinating because I don't think there's ever been any one source that had so much information about each of us - who we talk to, who our friends are, what books we read, what we're buying, what movies we saw, what our travel is.": "Rick",
  "I have just returned from Boston. It is the only thing to do if you find yourself up there.": "Fred",
  "In the Arctic, the Inuit are saying water and land are the same; they're an unbroken unity. In the winter, you travel on the ice because it's the linkage and the easiest way, and in the summer, you move around on the water.": "John",
  "Novels set in distant places give us expectations not unlike those we have of travel writing, and often the distinctions are blurred, as in, say, the way the low life of Tokyo's Shinjuku Ward is depicted in John David Morley's recent 'Pictures from the Water Trade.'": "Darryl",
  "I love short trips to New York to me it is the finest three-day town on earth. ": "James",
  "No matter where I've been overseas, the food stinks, except in Italy.": "Carmen",
  "Traveling is seeing it is the implicit that we travel by. ": "Cynthia",
  "I'm a travel enthusiast.": "Iggy",
  "I like to travel in jeans because I don't want to wallow around in my suit, you know? They cost too much. Jeans are comfortable.": "Louie",
  "It really is a fact that liberals are much higher than conservatives on a major personality trait called 'openness to experience.' People who are high on openness to experience just crave novelty, variety, diversity, new ideas, travel. People low on it like things that are familiar, that are safe and dependable.": "Jonathan",
  "I did rebel. I was the rebel in my family, because my dad wanted me to go and just travel with him.": "Dhani",
  "A man who leaves home to mend himself and others is a philosopher; but he who goes from country to country, guided by the blind impulse of curiosity, is a vagabond.": "Oliver",
  "I'd rather have huge success and huge failures than travel in the middle of the road.": "Kevyn",
  "Every time I took a long leave from home, I felt as if I were going to conquer the world. Or rather, take possession of what is my birthright, my inheritance.": "Ella",
  "In America there are two classes of travel - first class, and with children.": "Robert",
  "I want to travel around the country and make my living playing music. I also try to behave in a way that I would appreciate as a music fan. That's how we conduct ourselves, be it in writing music or playing it live.": "Buzz",
  "You become a better writer by writing. You become a better travel writer by writing about travel.": "Tim",
  "When I travel I normally eat club sandwiches or I bring my own food. When you go into a new town, it's very had to find a good place to eat.": "Paul",
  "My writing is a combination of three elements. The first is travel: not travel like a tourist, but travel as exploration. The second is reading literature on the subject. The third is reflection.": "Ryszard",
  "The perfect pop song is a 20th-century creation; it's not a sonnet, it's not an opera, it's something short - three and a half minutes by nature - and has this ability to travel and to defy class and economic structures.": "Doug",
  "Actually, I started to become an actress because I met someone who was just a friend and I found his life wonderful, I thought, Oh my god, you can travel, you're free, you can do what you want, you're the boss. And then I met an actor and I was in love with him.": "Lea",
  "Whether a plane to Singapore, a subway in Manhattan, or the streets of Cincinnati, I search for meaningful conversation wherever I may travel. Without it, I believe we lose the ability to not only understand others, but more importantly, ourselves.": "Dhani",
  "Every day is intense and alive, whether it's travel, work, even down time, which there is so little of.": "Josh",
  "The worst thing about touring is the travel.": "Kerry",
  "When I was little, I didn't really travel - from the suburbs to Paris was already a journey. I had a foreigner's eye on the city, and I still enjoy that point of view. Then there's the fact that one of the things that touches me most is injustice.": "JR",
  "I always thought when I hit 50 years old that'd be it for the travel. I don't have to tell you - you wait at an airport, your flight's delayed, get on a 14-hour flight, get off, get stuck in traffic, you get to the hotel and the room service is closed.": "Brian",
  "To get away from one's working environment is, in a sense, to get away from one's self; and this is often the chief advantage of travel and change.": "Charles",
  "Greater personal choice, individually tailored services, stronger local accountability, greater efficiency - these are all central to the new direction of travel we have set for our public services.": "John",
  "Movie acting is a great job for your twenties: You travel all over, you have affairs with people, and you throw yourself into one part and then another. It gets more challenging as you get older, and it's not just having a daughter, it's wanting to have your own life and be yourself.": "Helen",
  "The only thing I like about air travel is it gives me time to read.": "Jane",
  "Rail travel for me is the most relaxing, most scenic way to see the country.": "John",
  "I wanted to do my part to help preserve that golden age of travel... I step aboard The Patron Tequila Express railcar, and I go back in time to the days when a long journey was something fun and very special.": "John",
  "I've always enjoyed traveling and having experience with different cultures and different people. But it's also a wonderful thing to be able to benefit and enable research, not only in our country but around the world.": "Laurel",
  "I'm passionate and I travel the world not just as a tourist but to understand cultures... I've lived with Masai tribe... I travel the world and bring it back in the form of a research book that would become the starting point for the collection.": "John",
  "I travel a lot, but I don't come away with new inspiration.": "Edward",
  "As an actor, I travel around a lot and live in a lot of hotels, and many times I've been in a town where the only entertainment to be had is what you find in the hotel bar or lobby.": "Beau",
  "You discover how confounding the world is when you try to draw it. You look at a car, and you try to see its car-ness, and you're like an immigrant to your own world. You don't have to travel to encounter weirdness. You wake up to it.": "Shaun",
  "But I want people to understand that poker's not all glamorous, it's not all being on TV and making tons of money. It's a hard life. It's a lot of travel. It's a lot of weird hours.": "Chris",
  "I mean, the first 'Back to the Future' is kind of a perfect script, I think, in terms of handling time travel the best. It depends on your definition. To me, that means it effectively uses it in the story.": "Rian",
  "My parents and my grandfather on my mom's side would travel the earth. They went to Australia and China, and they went to probably every soccer game I ever played.": "Brandi",
  "I still don't have a car. I still travel by public transport. I take autos to travel to and fro for recordings.": "Arijit",
  "For years, I had a top secret clearance and never left Russia. Just once did I go to Bulgaria with my wife for a holiday at the Golden Sands resort, but I could not mention my real name. I was allowed to travel abroad only in the early 1990s.": "Mikhail",
  "When Bangladesh refused to renew my passport, I used U.N. travel documents. You can't disown your country.": "Taslima",
  "Then I was lucky I met with my future husband, and I started new life with my husband, and I was happy again. He was a musician. I start to travel with him through Europe also and around the former Soviet Union.": "Olga",
  "I always travel with my guitar. I take it myself - with me in my hand. I don't like to send it by cargo because it's dangerous. There is no way I would do that.": "Juanes",
  "The hardest part is to travel, and to be away from your family.": "Glenn",
  "My wife and I have so much fun when we travel and find anything... like stray cats and squirrels.": "Eric",
  "Travel is very subjective. What one person loves, another loathes.": "Robin",
  "I don't think I could have a genuine relationship with someone who didn't love to travel and appreciate new foods. Traveling is a big part of my life, and I want to share that with the people close to me.": "Candice",
  "For the Trump brand name, when we build, we want only the best buildings in the world. We travel a lot to see real estate projects worldwide, and we always study what can be done better. There's no question about it: a Trump Tower has to have the very best quality, amenities and facilities. People want that ultra-luxurious lifestyle.": "Eric",
  "One of the perks of my job as a fashion journalist is the travel opportunity.": "Derek",
  "I want to explore a new place each year, and it can be within India. When I was shooting for 'Mohenjo Daro', I couldn't travel out of the country for two years. But it gave me an opportunity to explore new places within India. I'm sure there are so many places to explore in India, and I would love to go there.": "Pooja",
  "On reflection, I am always pleasantly surprised when ordinary members of the public stop me in the street to say, 'Thank you,' I guess for making travel and other goods and services affordable to them.": "Stelios",

  "As many of you know I travel a good bit and do not get to see my friends and family as much as I would like.": "Natalie",
  "Sometimes you just want to get away and be normal for a few days. It's a treat to travel without your racket bag.": "Eugenie",
  "High-speed rail would revolutionise interstate travel and would also be an economic game-changer for dozens of regional communities along its path.": "Anthony",
  "I myself believe that there will one day be time travel because when we find that something isn't forbidden by the over-arching laws of physics we usually eventually find a technological way of doing it.": "David",
  "I get pretty much all the exercise I need walking down airport concourses carrying bags.": "Guy",
  "As you think, you travel, and as you love, you attract. You are today where your thoughts have brought you; you will be tomorrow where your thoughts take you.": "James",
  "Normally, it takes me about three years to write one of the big books. It is usually four years between releases because of the huge amount of travel and PR and just nuisance going on around them. I have a lot of pressure from publishers and agents.": "Diana",
  "For young girls, whom I meet a lot when I travel around the country, it will be a big thing. It will really show them that there's no post in Denmark that a girl can't aspire to.": "Helle",
  "The biggest luxury is a job in which I get to live in New York, travel the world, and work with so many incredible people.": "Leigh",
  "I'm not a DJ, I don't know how to scratch and I don't know how to mix, but I do know how to party. One of my jobs is actually to travel the world and party.": "Amber",
  "Air travel survived decades of terrorism, including attacks which resulted in the deaths of everyone on the plane. It survived 9/11. It'll survive the next successful attack. The only real worry is that we'll scare ourselves into making air travel so onerous that we won't fly anymore.": "Bruce",
  "I don't travel anywhere without the PS3 and XBox. There's nothing better to do on long bus trips while on tour.": "Soulja",
  "I get to travel, see the world, meet people and be independent. I feel blessed.": "Bar",
  "I'm a painter, really. To be successful, you have to go to Hollywood, and I didn't like to travel.": "H.",
  "I travel often, so my routine is always getting scrambled. But on a standard sort of day, I get up at 6, pack lunches, hustle the kids off to school, then brew a pot of coffee and head downstairs to the dungeon, as I call it: my cobwebby office in the basement.": "Benjamin",
  "For people to understand me when I travel, I speak with my hands.": "Marcel",
  "I would like to host a show, something like travel or cooking or something like that, something I'm really interested in, and so I'm pitching a couple television shows.": "Trishelle",
  "Since traveling is such a big part of my life when I am working, I like to vacation relatively close to home. Florida is a great place for me to go and relax. It's so close, which is perfect because it's the minimal travel time.": "Hilary",
  "The attention of a traveller, should be particularly turned, in the first place, to the various works of Nature, to mark the distinctions of the climates he may explore, and to offer such useful observations on the different productions as may occur.": "William",
  "Two great talkers will not travel far together.": "George",
  "Wherever we go, across the Pacific or Atlantic, we meet, not similarity so much as 'the bizarre'. Things astonish us, when we travel, that surprise nobody else.": "Mary",
  "The gift of sobriety is clarity and a sense of connection - and travel only enhances that.": "J.",
  "My first ever job after college was as a flight attendant. I wanted to travel and could not afford it, so I decided to get myself a job where I could travel. I did it for two years and had great fun.": "Jacqueline",
  "I think it's important to travel around in order to get a notion of what's going on, to find out what people are think about. I enjoy talking on campuses most because people are more informed and discussion is generally livelier.": "Harrison",
  "All I wanted was to be big, to be in show business and to travel... and that's what I've been doing all my life.": "Count",
  "To enjoy enduring success we should travel a little in advance of the world.": "John",

  "If you travel first class, you think first class and you are more likely to play first class.": "Ray",
  "White sharks and tuna travel for thousands of miles before returning to the same hot spot just as salmon do when they return to the same stream. These journeys are the marine equivalent of wildebeest migrations that take place on the Serengeti plain in Africa.": "Barbara",
  "All my books reflect travel adventures of some kind, and all have a soul: a spiritual or mystical underpinning.": "O.",
  "On the whole, when I travel to different countries, I like to find the hidden places, so I tend to avoid the cities - but in terms of the ease of getting about, finding what you need, the excitement, that undercurrent of whatever you want it to be, it's got to be London.": "Will",
  "Airline travel is hours of boredom interrupted by moments of stark terror.": "Al",
  "Soul travel can be a general expansion of awareness and knowingness or conscious experience of the heavenly worlds.": "Bob",
  "A journey by Sea and Land, Five Hundred Miles, is not undertaken without money.": "Lewis",
  "It's hard now to imagine that kind of travel and the daily tasks they simply took for granted. If a wagon axle broke, you had to stop and carve a new one. To cross a river, you sometimes had to build a raft.": "James",

  "One's life has value so long as one attributes value to the life of others, by means of love, friendship, indignation and compassion.": "Simone",
  "Grief changes shape, but it never ends.": "Keanu",
  "One might expect that the families of murder victims would be showered with sympathy and support, embraced by their communities. But in reality they are far more likely to feel isolated, fearful, and ashamed, overwhelmed by grief and guilt, angry at the criminal-justice system, and shunned by their old friends.": "Eric",
  "It is only after one is in trouble that one realizes how little sympathy and kindness there are in the world.": "Nellie",
  "I've always thought of acting as more of an exercise in empathy, which is not to be confused with sympathy. You're trying to get inside a certain emotional reality or motivational reality and try to figure out what that's about so you can represent it.": "Edward",
  "What is lovely never dies, But passes into other loveliness.": "Thomas",
  "The dew of compassion is a tear.": "Lord",
  "It is a great consolation for me to remember that the Lord, to whom I had drawn near in humble and child-like faith, has suffered and died for me, and that He will look on me in love and compassion.": "Wolfgang",
  "A sorrow's crown of sorrow is remembering happier times.": "Alfred",
  "Come away, O human child: To the waters and the wild with a fairy, hand in hand, For the world's more full of weeping than you can understand.": "William",
  "Our trials, our sorrows, and our grieves develop us.": "Orison",
  "I say to people who care for people who are dying, if you really love that person and want to help them, be with them when their end comes close. Sit with them - you don't even have to talk. You don't have to do anything but really be there with them.": "Elisabeth",
  "It is foolish to tear one's hair in grief, as though sorrow would be made less by baldness.": "Marcus",
  "Let no one weep for me, or celebrate my funeral with mourning; for I still live, as I pass to and fro through the mouths of men.": "Quintus",
  "When you're successful, people have no sympathy. Nobody wants to catch the tears of a millionaire.": "Boy",
  "When sorrows come, they come not single spies, but in battalions.": "William",
  "Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish; Earth has no sorrow that Heaven cannot heal.": "Thomas",
  "Truly, it is in darkness that one finds the light, so when we are in sorrow, then this light is nearest of all to us.": "Meister",
  "Children require guidance and sympathy far more than instruction.": "Anne",
  "Interest does not tie nations together it sometimes separates them. But sympathy and understanding does unite them. ": "Woodrow",
  "The knowledge that we have brother scouts working in the same uniform, to the same ends, in the same way, in all corners of the Empire, cannot but make scouts proud of their brotherhood, and cannot fail to bring them into closer sympathy.": "Robert",
  "Sorrow is so easy to express and yet so hard to tell.": "Joni",
  "Any other illness, any other disease that we're faced with, there's sympathy and understanding. We get help for those. With mental illness, our go-to is to categorize them as, 'Oh, they're crazy,' to belittle the problem.": "Chris",
  "Women ought to feel a peculiar sympathy in the colored man's wrong, for, like him, she has been accused of mental inferiority, and denied the privileges of a liberal education.": "Angelina",
  "Any mind that is capable of real sorrow is capable of good.": "Harriet",
  "To desire and expect nothing for oneself and to have profound sympathy for others is genuine holiness.": "Ivan",
  "Grief knits two hearts in closer bonds than happiness ever can and common sufferings are far stronger links than common joys. ": "Alphonse",
  "Badges mean nothing in themselves, but they mark a certain achievement and they are a link between the rich and the poor. For when one girl sees a badge on a sister Scout's arm, if that girl has won the same badge, it at once awakens an interest and sympathy between them.": "Juliette",
  "As human beings, we all have reasons for our behavior. There may be people who have certain physiological issues that dictate why they make certain choices. On the whole, though, I think we're dictated by our structure, our past, our environment, our culture. So once you understand the patterns that shape a person, how can you not find sympathy?": "Forest",
  "In externals we advance with lightening express speed, in modes of thought and sympathy we lumber on in stage-coach fashion.": "Frances",
  "True Scouts are the best friends of animals, for from living in the woods and wilds, and practising observation and tracking, they get to know more than other people about the ways and habits of birds and animals, and therefore they understand them and are more in sympathy with them.": "Robert",
  "It's no good being nice and young and naive. There's no good in that at all. You've got to do it all yourself, and you've gotta learn quick. And you can't look for sympathy either.": "John",
  "Developing our sympathetic compassion is not only possible but the only reason for us to be here on earth.": "George",
  "Only by joy and sorrow does a person know anything about themselves and their destiny. They learn what to do and what to avoid.": "Johann",
  "I was brought up to be sympathetic toward others.": "Joyce",
  "Excess of grief for the dead is madness; for it is an injury to the living, and the dead know it not.": "Xenophon",
  "Grieve and mourn for yourself not once or twice, but again and again.": "Morrie",
  "Both tears and sweat are salty, but they render a different result. Tears will get you sympathy; sweat will get you change.": "Jesse",
  "What is the meaning of 'gossip?' Doesn't it originate with sympathy, an interest in one's neighbor, degenerating into idle curiosity and love of tattling? Which is worse, this habit, or keeping one's self so absorbed intellectually as to forget the sufferings and cares of others, to lose sympathy through having too much to think about?": "Lucy",
  "No one has yet realized the wealth of sympathy, the kindness and generosity hidden in the soul of a child. The effort of every true education should be to unlock that treasure.": "Emma",
  "In fiction, imaginary people become realer to us than any named celebrity glimpsed in a series of rumored events, whose causes and subtler ramifications must remain in the dark. An invented figure like Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary emerges fully into the light of understanding, which brings with it identification, sympathy and pity.": "John",
  "I am really drawn to damaged characters, and I have a lot of sympathy for them. Making those complicated characters empathetic is something to strive for. It's too easy to create a good guy or a good girl.": "Paul",
  "The Nazi movement is in many respects one which has my warmest sympathy.": "George",
  "Character is made of duty and love and sympathy, and, above all, of living and working for others.": "Robert",
  "When we are out of sympathy with the young, then I think our work in this world is over.": "George",
  "I feel sympathy for the working class lad. I've always championed about ticket prices and try to equate that to people's salaries.": "Alex",
  "I tend to foster drama via bleakness. If I want the reader to feel sympathy for a character, I cleave the character in half, on his birthday. And then it starts raining. And he's made of sugar.": "George",
  "It appears to be a law that you cannot have a deep sympathy with both man and nature.": "Henry",
  "I have several close friends who are insomniacs. Over the years, I've heard their stories about being up in the middle of the night, completely awake. I see them yawn at 11 A.M. and know that, regardless of what they are doing, they'd probably rather be in bed sleeping. I've always had sympathy for them, but I've never really understood it.": "Brad",
  "The irony is that I'm actually a very empathetic person, but I don't believe in sympathy at all.": "Jillian",
  "AIDS had won gays sympathy they no longer seemed the privileged brats that the general populace had resented in the 1970s. ": "Edmund",
  "Ultimately, we'll help the people we discriminate against if we try to understand more about them; genetics will lead to a world where there is a sympathy for the underdog.": "James",
  "Teetotallers lack the sympathy and generosity of men that drink.": "W.",
  "When our bodies are sick and people extend their sympathy, bring us soup, offer up solutions. When our minds are sick, people tend to shy away from you, be afraid, or call you outright crazy. I'm fascinated by the way society and individuals view mental illness, and most of my shorts comment on that.": "Anna",
  "I have a strong sympathy for all women who have struggled and suffered.": "Edmonia",
  "Almost all of our sorrows spring out of our relations with other people.": "Arthur",
  "From the end spring new beginnings.": "Pliny",
  "To all those who have suffered as a consequence of our troubled past I extend my sincere thoughts and deep sympathy. With the benefit of historical hindsight we can all see things which we would wish had been done differently or not at all.": "Queen",
  "People who drink to drown their sorrow should be told that sorrow knows how to swim.": "Ann",
  "After you have wept and grieved for your physical losses, cherish the functions and the life you have left.": "Morrie",
  "I've always liked Saturn. But I also have some sympathy for Pluto because I heard it's been downgraded from a planet, and I think it should remain a planet. Once you've given something planetary status it's kind of mean to take it away.": "Jared",
  "I have sometimes been wildly, despairingly, acutely miserable, racked with sorrow, but through it all I still know quite certainly that just to be alive is a grand thing.": "Agatha",
  "If you suppress grief too much, it can well redouble.": "Moliere",
  "I believe that we must reach our brother, never toning down our fundamental oppositions, but meeting him when he asks to be met, with a reason for the faith that is in us, as well as with a loving sympathy for them as brothers.": "Dorothy",
  "We Germans have a special responsibility to be alert, sensitive, and aware of what we did during the Nazi era and about lasting damage caused in other countries. I've got tremendous sympathy for that.": "Angela",
  "In the early days of the Russian Revolution in 1917, I was completely in sympathy with it. I felt that it established a new era in the history of the modern world. I was so overwhelmed by it that, if people made any unfriendly comment, I would vigorously defend it. If people condemned the Communist party, I would speak in its defense.": "Chiang",
  "If you're disabled, and you're trying to achieve your dreams, accept the fact right now that you have to work 500 times more than the average bear next to you. Stop bucking for sympathy, put on your titanium legs, and run.": "Maysoon",
  "Grief can't be shared. Everyone carries it alone. His own burden in his own way.": "Anne",
  "What ye have been ye still shall be, When we are dust the dust among, O yellow flowers!": "Henry",
  "I think loss of loved ones is the hardest blow in life.": "Marlo",
  "I will indulge my sorrows, and give way to all the pangs and fury of despair.": "Joseph",
  "Pity may represent little more than the impersonal concern which prompts the mailing of a check, but true sympathy is the personal concern which demands the giving of one's soul.": "Martin",
  "Farewell, dearest friend, never to see one another any more till at the right hand of Christ.": "Donald",
  "Men are often biased in their judgment on account of their sympathy and their interests.": "George",
  "There is something terribly morbid in the modern sympathy with pain. One should sympathise with the colour, the beauty, the joy of life. The less said about life's sores the better.": "Oscar",
  "Having a baby is a disaster for your career. I don't think there's any sympathy.": "Mariella",
  "Obviously, Jay-Z is one of the greatest entertainers of the world today. Not only is he a remarkable rhetorical genius, he's also a man of deep sympathy and empathy for those who are lost and vulnerable, but especially under-educated youth of all cultures and stripes.": "Michael",
  "It is in our faults and failings, not in our virtues, that we touch each other, and find sympathy. It is in our follies that we are one.": "Jerome",
  "If there was less sympathy in the world, there would be less trouble in the world.": "Oscar",
  "Sympathy is two hearts tugging at one load.": "Charles",
  "The cure for sorrow is to learn something.": "Barbara",
  "The rule of friendship means there should be mutual sympathy between them, each supplying what the other lacks and trying to benefit the other, always using friendly and sincere words.": "Marcus",
  "A person who has sympathy for mankind in the lump, faith in its future progress, and desire to serve the great cause of this progress, should be called not a humanist, but a humanitarian, and his creed may be designated as humanitarianism.": "Irving",
  "I can hardly express in words my deep feeling and sympathy for them, knowing as I do, the many serious handicaps and obstacles that will confront them in almost every walk of life.": "Major",
  "There's a certain amount of sympathy here for the Bush administration's problem, which is they would like to get rid of Saddam Hussein and they would like to have the Kurds autonomous.": "Les",
  "I belong to a nation which over the past centuries has experienced many hardships and reverses. The world reacted with silence or with mere sympathy when Polish frontiers were crossed by invading armies and the sovereign state had to succumb to brutal force.": "Lech",
  "Here's my rule: You always want to pay cash for your own books, because if they look at the name on the credit card and then they look at the name on the book jacket, then there's this look of such profound sympathy for you that you had to resort to this. It really is withering.": "Carl",
  "The relation of landlord and tenant is not an ideal one, but any relations in a social order will endure if there is infused into them some of that spirit of human sympathy which qualifies life for immortality.": "George",
  "Women are about the best lovers of nature, after all; at least of nature in her milder and more familiar forms. The feminine character, the feminine perceptions, intuitions, delicacy, sympathy, quickness, are more responsive to natural forms and influences than is the masculine mind.": "John",
  "This circus that's advertised to show and furnish a little amusement for us heathens is owned by a woman, one whose pluck catches my sympathy every time.": "Wild",
  "The American people want something terse, forcible, picturesque, striking - something that will arrest their attention, enlist their sympathy, arouse their indignation, stimulate their imagination, convince their reason, awaken their conscience.": "Joseph",
  "We're so much more likely to feel sympathy for an animal than another person; thus, the best fiction uses animals to define truly humane behavior.": "Chuck",
  "In 1800, in the first interparty contest, the Federalists warned that presidential candidate Thomas Jefferson, because of his sympathy expressed at the outset of the French Revolution, was 'the son of a half-breed Indian squaw' who would put opponents under the guillotine.": "Robert",
  "Pierre Curie came to see me and showed a simple and sincere sympathy with my student life. Soon he caught the habit of speaking to me of his dream of an existence consecrated entirely to scientific research, and he asked me to share that life.": "Marie",
  "Manhattan's probably one of the bluest parts in the country, and Indiana's definitely one of the redder states. I have sympathy for both sides.": "Jim",
  "I would rather be kept alive in the efficient if cold altruism of a large hospital than expire in a gush of warm sympathy in a small one.": "Aneurin",
  "It is the right of our people to organize to oppose any law and any part of the Constitution with which they are not in sympathy.": "Al",
  "Great grief does not of itself put an end to itself.": "Lucius",
  "I am convinced that, despite what you think of Obama, I don't think Obama has a person-to-person connection with people. I think people love him because of his race and feel sorry for him, object of sympathy. I think people feel he's a victim, he portrays himself as a victim of America; he gets sympathy that way.": "Rush",
  "What is it that distinguishes you and me from the lower animals - from the beasts? More, I say, than anything else, human sympathy - human sympathy.": "Robert",
  "Two nations between whom there is no intercourse and no sympathy; who are as ignorant of each other's habits, thoughts, and feelings, as if they were dwellers in different zones, or inhabitants of different planets. The rich and the poor.": "Benjamin",
  "I didn't go to university. Didn't even finish A-levels. But I have sympathy for those who did.": "Terry",
  "I'm not looking for sympathy at all.": "Arnold",
  "Marriage must be a relation either of sympathy or of conquest.": "George",
  "The mission of '8 Mile' is essentially to garner sympathy for a white rapper involved in an old-school shootout - a rap contest. This may be the final frontier for pop, more unbelievable than the prospect of launching a member of 'N Sync into orbit.": "Elvis",
  "Sympathy is one of the principles most widely rooted in our nature: we rejoice to see ourselves reflected in another; and, perversely enough, we sometimes have a secret pleasure in seeing the sin which dwells in ourselves existing under a deformed and monstrous aspect in another.": "William",
  "Bear and endure: This sorrow will one day prove to be for your good.": "Ovid",
  "I can't understand why someone wouldn't have a degree of sympathy for people that had to flee their country, travel to try and find their home somewhere, and nobody wants them. How could you not be a little bit sympathetic?": "Gary",
  "I like the Rolling Stones for karaoke. 'Sympathy For The Devil' is a great one.": "Hugh",
  "The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual. The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community.": "William",
  "I'm constantly amazed by the ability a child has to show sympathy, to read emotions, to get to the heart of any situation. It's unfiltered and completely inspiring.": "David",
  "I felt bad when George Bush was booed. But only briefly. My sympathy for that man has a half-life of about four seconds.": "Dick",
  "We do not learn by inference and deduction and the application of mathematics to philosophy, but by direct intercourse and sympathy.": "Richard",
  "Abstract sympathy with the working class as an economic entity is easy, but the feeling can vanish on contact with actual members of the group, who often arrive with disturbing beliefs and powerful resentments - who might not sound or look like people urban progressives want to know.": "George",
  "I'm not sympathetic. I have zero sympathy. I understand about emotional eating, I understand how painful the process can be, but I also understand that change is possible.": "Jillian",
  "My upbringing has given me sympathy for the idea of isolation and what it is to be a new person in the room, where everyone else has some amount of familiarity and comfort.": "Julianne",
  "AI don't make a big thing out of my race. If you try to preach, people give you a little sympathy and then they want to get out of the way. So you don't preach; you tell the story.": "Jim",
  "Increased sympathy for an Islamist cause, lack of integration, and the absence of acceptance of Muslims into British society makes it harder for Muslims to challenge Islamism and tough for non-Muslims to understand it.": "Maajid",
  "There's a great tradition of actors taking on parts of much less obvious sympathy.": "Edward",
  "Any sympathy won for Aileen Wuornos based on a lie is not sympathy at all. The question is, can we have sympathy for the circumstances of someone's life? That's what I was interested in.": "Patty",
  "Fess up, 'Hunger Games' fans: Does anyone care about Peeta or find him attractive? He's the Ron Weasley of the series: he gets points for callow valor and sympathy for his run of bad luck, but he remains a pasty, earnest bore.": "Richard",
  "I have no sympathy for debunking human achievements that, in the end, gave ordinary people liberty.": "Paul",
  "It's hard to penetrate characters who are very cut off and lack empathy and to do it with sympathy. It's so easy to make a damaged character repugnant.": "Siri",
  "I've never wanted sympathy votes in anything I do in my life.": "Amy",
  "Despite my excellent mood, I don't have any sympathy for Romney. If he'd been a good candidate he wouldn't have had a different campaign for every month on the calendar.": "Gail",
  "Sometimes, in the midst of a tragedy like the Newton massacre, we witness incredible acts of valor, tenderness, grace, and decency. We saw it from Sandy Hook Elementary School's teachers, students, and parents, as well as from their community and country. The outpouring of sympathy and help has been touching and, at times, inspiring.": "Campbell",
  "I'm not going to give a courtesy gift to a person who's going to win, and I'm not going to give a sympathy gift to a person who's going to lose.": "Tim",
  "The comic novels I did when I was in my 20s had a harder edge - less sympathy for people. Or a sympathy that was harder to detect: Characters' foibles and obsessive bents were unrelenting, like caricatures.": "Lydia",
  "Most of my younger Native American friends are not in any way looking for sympathy, and they're not looking to lay guilt on anybody. They have their dignity, and they do what they do.": "Robbie",
  "Personally, I have detested Gordon Brown since the moment in 2001 when he tried to make cheap capital out of the Laura Spence affair; as his troubles have piled up, I have felt no sympathy for him at all.": "Justin",
  "I have every sympathy for writers. It's a mystery to me what they do. I can edit. I can cross out and say, 'I'm not saying that' or, 'How about we move this to here? Wouldn't that make that bit of the story better?' But where any of it comes from is beyond me. I will never write a play or a novel.": "Alan",
  "As with the onset of sudden celebrity, for the newly rich, the world often becomes a darker, narrower, less generous place; a paradox that elicits scant sympathy, but is nonetheless true.": "Felix",
  "With a film, you just don't have time to build sympathy for the character. But I think we're moving away from that in TV. With TV, you have a little more leeway to allow them to rise and fall and rise again and be much more complicated beings.": "Rachel",
  "One often calms one's grief by recounting it.": "Pierre",
  "I take people very seriously. People are all I take seriously, in fact. Therefore, I have nothing but sympathy for how people behave - and nothing but laughter to console them with.": "John",
  "It's not very interesting to establish sympathy for people who, on the surface, are instantly sympathetic. I guess I'm always attracted to people who, if their lives were headlines in a newspaper, you might not be very sympathetic about them.": "John",
  "The Who on record were dynamic. Roger Daltrey's delivery allowed vulnerability without weakness; doubt and confusion, but no plea for sympathy.": "Eddie",
  "I damaged my health during 'Les Mis,' which I didn't want to mention in case it seemed like I was courting sympathy.": "Anne",
  "In documentary filmmaking, there's a tradition of telling stories about victims. We often do that from a very patronizing place, but mostly we do it from a very selfish place, to reassure ourselves that our lives are in sympathy and solidarity with the victims.": "Joshua",
  "I have sympathy for the people in Syria, and I do think there should be a worldwide response, but we should act cautiously.": "Jeff",
  "I'm a champion for personal differences. I have no sympathy for drug companies that can't figure out how to make personalized medicine. We could generalize that to 'All society should be much more personalized.'": "George",
  "I have a great deal of sympathy for reluctant readers because I was one. I would do anything to avoid reading. In my case, it wasn't until I was 13 and discovered the 'Lord of the Rings' that I learned to love reading.": "Rick",
  "Too often, we get attention and sympathy by being a victim. If we're invested in someone being our villain, we must love being the victim. We have to let go of both characters in the story.": "Regina",
  "The heart forgets its sorrow and ache.": "James",
  "Those who peacefully gather to express sympathy for the family of Michael Brown must have their rights respected at all times. And journalists must not be harassed or prevented from covering a story that needs to be told.": "Eric",
  "Sympathy is the first condition of criticism.": "Henri",
  "All sympathy not consistent with acknowledged virtue is but disguised selfishness.": "Samuel",
  "Labor should be recognized as entitled to consult with management in the mutual interest. Labor cannot be driven, and business cannot be successful unless the men employed in it are enthusiastic and loyal. That loyalty cannot be obtained with a big stick; it must be based upon fair dealing and sympathy.": "Charles",
  "I am a believer in the evolutionary process, and yet I have sympathy for the friends of mine who are creationists. I don't find the positions incompatible.": "John",
  "To avoid becoming chronically unemployed, people need more than platitudes offering sympathy. Career reinvention requires encouragement and guidance.": "Nina",
  "I have nothing but sympathy for the people who are forced to work with me. I'm better now at picking out those that want to play that game with me, and those that don't.": "Alton",
  "A lot of actors find it impossible not to ask for the audience's sympathy. They have a need to twinkle.": "Julian",
  "I spent three and a half years writing the novel 'Chang & Eng,' about the conjoined brothers for whom the term 'Siamese twins' was contrived, and when I think of these afflicted people, my only emotion is one of profound sympathy.": "Darin",
  "I very much dislike the intolerance and moralism of many Christians, and feel more sympathy with Honest Doubters than with them.": "A.",
  "Barton Fink is just too self-important as an artist to get much sympathy.": "Ethan",
  "If men and women are to understand each other, to enter into each other's nature with mutual sympathy, and to become capable of genuine comradeship, the foundation must be laid in youth.": "Havelock",
  "It's a game that just takes so much out of you. Every aspect of your life has to be very narrow, very focused. Everything else has to go away. And because of that, I think it's obviously not healthy. The last thing I'm looking for is sympathy.": "Alex",
  "There is a joy in sorrow which none but a mourner can know.": "Jean",
  "I have sympathy for young people, for their growing pains, but I balk when these growing pains are pushed into the foreground, when you make these young people the only vehicles of life's wisdom.": "Wislawa",
  "I have to have a character worth caring about. I tend not to start writing books about people I don't have a lot of sympathy for because I'm just going to be with them too long.": "Richard",
  "Like many people, most Libertarians feel empathy and sympathy for less fortunate people. But they know you can't have perfection in a world of limited resources.": "Harry",
  "The natural effect of sorrow over the dead is to refine and elevate the mind.": "Washington",
  "NFL fans have less sympathy for fallen players than the Romans had for blind Christians.": "Stephen",
  "There are times when a sports figure doesn't deserve sympathy.": "Stephen",
  "I never ask for mercy and seek no one's sympathy.": "Conrad",
  "Our late Leader, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, with his universal sympathy for all oppressed and his profound understanding of Jesus' revolutionary spirit of love and sacrifice, carried on his revolutionary work for forty years and brought about at last the liberation of the Chinese people.": "Chiang",
  "My impressions of the Russian Revolution can be divided into two periods. The first period was when I showed deep sympathy. My second period is one of disappointment. This change was the result of close observation on the spot.": "Chiang",
  "I learnt pity, sympathy, and what it was like to be at the other end of the stick. Such lessons can't be learnt in lecture halls.": "Lionel",
  "When you've been raised in care, rap music isn't just about guns and sexism. They're talking about real things you can hang on to, problems of identity that you have sympathy with. It's not just about the music, with rap: when I was in care, it meant a whole lot more than that.": "Samantha",
  "If the terrorists have the sympathy of people, it's much harder to find them. So we need people on our side, and that leads us to be responsible leaders of the world, show some concern with the problems.": "George",
  "I have to express sympathy from the bottom of my heart to those people who were taken as wartime comfort women. As a human being, I would like to express my sympathies, and also as prime minister of Japan I need to apologize to them.": "Shinzo",
  "Life has never been easy. Nor is it meant to be. It is a matter of being joyous in the face of sorrow.": "Dirk",
  "If we wait until our lives are free from sorrow or difficulty, then we wait forever. And miss the entire point.": "Dirk",
  "I have sympathy for anyone who finds consolation anywhere we can. And many people do find it in religious tradition as it has been. I mean, I love much of that tradition. But somehow, that just didn't speak to me in the way that it does to some.": "Elaine",
  "As far as I'm concerned, I own my dogs as I own my body. My legs are with me when I take a shower, and I feel no shame. If I were to lose one, I'd grieve, and people would send sympathy cards, but it would be my condition that evoked the sympathy, not the fate of the leg. That's like losing a dog.": "Elizabeth",
  "I don't want to be entertained. I don't want visuals or musicals. I don't want a vacation. I don't want to quit. I don't want sympathy. The cry of my heart is 'Just Give Me Jesus.'": "Anne",
  "The more sympathy you give, the less you need.": "Malcolm",
  "Our sympathy is cold to the relation of distant misery.": "Edward",
  "I sometimes get that wonderful sympathy between me and the audience, telling me I've reached their hearts. And when I do, the thrill is mine.": "Kate",
  "Something that's seldom appreciated about me is that I am in sympathy with a great deal of what Marx wrote, except that I'm on the side of the bourgeoisie.": "Niall",
  "In order that people who suffer from depression seek treatment without a second thought, the stigmas must further fall until we reach a point in time when that person with leukemia and that person with depression both receive the same level of sympathy and the same level of rigorous treatment. Both people deserve it.": "Gayle",
  "You will find that the woman who is really kind to dogs is always one who has failed to inspire sympathy in men.": "Max",
  "Recognition of belligerency as an expression of sympathy is all very well.": "Henry",
  "Motherhood is at its best when the tender chords of sympathy have been touched.": "Paul",
  "The humanitarian lays stress almost solely upon breadth of knowledge and sympathy.": "Irving",
  "The true humanist maintains a just balance between sympathy and selection.": "Irving",
  "I have a theory because I was being beaten up a lot by people outside of school, it was almost like if I could make myself sick enough they'd take sympathy on me.": "Daniel",
  "Those who weep recover more quickly than those who smile.": "Jean",
  "As a Scot, I instinctively feel a sympathy towards a culture which is based on generosity. It's very refreshing. Afghans think they're the best people in the world and their country is the best place in the world, and it's strange because you go there and it doesn't really look like it, and yet they assume that everybody else envies them.": "Rory",
  "Sympathy is charming, but it does not make up for pain.": "Lillie",
  "You have to have sympathy for and an empathy with a character in order to play them.": "Laura",
  "Whether rich people make money or lose money, they get no sympathy from the public.": "Gary",
  "We all have to announce our full solidarity with the struggle of those seeking freedom and justice in Syria, and translate this sympathy into a clear political vision that supports a peaceful transition to a democratic system of rule that reflects the demands of the Syrian people for freedom.": "Mohammed",
  "This sympathy is not translated into force against the British government because it is not like the anti- apartheid movement which had a high profile here and Mandela is a more engaging figure than Yasser Arafat.": "Tom",
  "The novelist must look on humanity without partiality or prejudice. His sympathy, like that of the historian, must be unbounded, and untainted by sect or party.": "Goldwin",
  "It's important to find characters that share sympathy with a young audience, not just in the story but their role in the world.": "Tim",
  "The late Tom Wicker's biography of Nixon, called 'One of Us,' is really quite good: you see the biographer discovering dimensions of sympathy for his subject that he hadn't expected to feel.": "Thomas",
  "I'm in total sympathy with Dick Smith's sentiments I only wish there were grounds for saying we Australians would never tolerate such appalling treatment of refugees being carried out in our name. ": "Hugh",
  "I joined the Party definitely in 1923 after having already been in sympathy with it before.": "Fritz",
  "Sympathy is something that shouldn't be bestowed upon the Yankees. Apparently it angers them.": "Bob",
  "Criticism in the universities, I'll have to admit, has entered a phase where I am totally out of sympathy with 95% of what goes on. It's Stalinism without Stalin.": "Harold",
  "I have a lot of sympathy for young people because I realize how disturbed I was. How would I deal with life in the future? What would I do for a living?": "Clyde",
  "According to your sympathy, you will take pleasure in your own happiness or in the happiness of other people; but it is always your own happiness you seek.": "John",
  "Sonia Gandhi and her husband have always been persons I look at with a lot of respect. Of course, one of the reasons we look at India with a lot of sympathy and enthusiasm is Sonia Gandhi. Now she is Indian, not Italian, but she will always represent a myth for Italians.": "Luca",
  "When men are arrested without any legal basis and for political reasons, it's merely a routine, everyday occurrence in Russia, and hardly anyone has any sympathy.": "Alexei",

  "I don't care about sympathy. I care about playing a character who's understandable and clear.": "Anson",
  "I don't really distinguish between sympathy and honesty when I'm writing. The two go together - I'm interested in inhabiting my characters, seeing the world through their eyes.": "Tom",
  "I have always thought it a great privilege to have as my colleague in the Palit Chair of Chemistry such a distinguished pioneer in scientific research and education in Bengal as Sir Prafulla Ray. It has been invariably my experience that I could count on his cooperation and sympathy in every matter concerning my scientific work.": "C.",

  "In the eyes of the Catholic Church, abortion is a tragedy. Our principle objective must be to try and win greater sympathy for that perspective and for the value of human life from its beginnings.": "Vincent",
  "But what you could perhaps do with in these days is a word of most sincere sympathy. Your movement is carried internally by so strong a truth and necessity that victory in one form or another cannot elude you for long.": "Hjalmar",
  "I believe that everyone can appreciate the right of a family to grieve the loss of a loved one in peace, regardless of anyone's position on the war in Iraq and Afghanistan.": "Dave",
  "You have to take strength from the people that love you and the people that love Barbara and the huge number of expressions of sympathy and compassion and support. That has been extremely moving.": "Ted",
  "Actors who are lovers in real life are often incapable if playing the part of lovers to an audience. It is equally true that sympathy between actors who are not lovers may create a temporary emotion that is perfectly sincere.": "Ivor",

  "As Christians, our compassion is simply a response to the love that God has already shown us.": "Steven",
  "There's something very beautiful and compelling about someone who has ambition and someone who knows what they want, but it can get a little frustrating at times, so I understand that. I have sympathy for that.": "Michael",
  "Although I'm Australian, I find myself much more in sympathy with the Austrian version!": "David",
  "A creative element is surely present in all great systems, and it does not seem possible that all sympathy or fundamental attitudes of will can be entirely eliminated from any human philosophy.": "Morris",
  "This is not a country that has had a tremendous sympathy for poor people, so I think that the notion that somehow we have slipped into an era in which poor people don't matter is not quite the way our history would define it.": "Faye",
  "It is by a wise economy of nature that those who suffer without change, and whom no one can help, become uninteresting. Yet so it may happen that those who need sympathy the most often attract it the least.": "F.",
  "I am the son of a small and far-away nation and the other laureates have all come from different countries from all over the world and we all were equally received here with signs of sympathy.": "Albert",
  "Since this war began our sympathy has gone out to all the suffering people who have been dragged into it. Further hundreds of millions have become involved since I spoke at Limerick fortnight ago.": "Eamon",
  "If you want to devote yourself to the arts, you'd better do it strictly from passion, because there is zero guarantee that you'll get anywhere. The hardest thing is dealing with business people who have nothing to do with your art. They could care less that you're up at 4:30 in the morning writing a joke. Don't expect any sympathy from anybody.": "Richard",
  "Extremist perspectives win sympathy and recruits because they offer narratives that claim to identify deep injustices and enemies.": "Jonas",
  "In Shakespeare, unique individuals repudiate the stereotypes demanded by the structure of the play: Shylock commands our sympathy, Barnardine refuses to be hanged. Individuals trump the category.": "Iain",
  "My guitar was loud as hell, and I had no sympathy for anybody else.": "Brownie",
  "Because I select my players from a feeling that comes to me when I am with them, a certain sympathy you might call it, or a vibration that exists between us that convinces me they are right.": "Erich",

  "To the factory farmer, in contrast to the traditional farmer with his sense of honor and obligation, the animals are 'production units,' and accorded all the sympathy that term suggests.": "Matthew",
  "California must be all American or all Chinese. We are resolved that it shall be American, and are prepared to make it so. May we not rely upon your sympathy and assistance?": "Denis",
  "I don't think it's an incredibly radical premise to try and have sympathy for someone who has made a mistake.": "Joe",
  "Okay, so, sometimes in life, I can be a score-keeper - someone who keeps track of what he gives and what he gets in return. An annoying quality, to say the least, and I'm sure my wife has your sympathy, but it's made me highly attuned to when and where credit is due.": "Mark",
  "If I'm feeling outraged, grief, disbelief, frustration, sympathy, that gets channeled through me and into my pictures and hopefully transmitted to the viewer.": "James",

  "Many of the artists who have represented Negro life have seen only the comic, ludicrous side of it, and have lacked sympathy with and appreciation for the warm big heart that dwells within such a rough exterior.": "Henry",
  "More negatives write than call. It's a cheap shot for me to go on the air with the critical letters or E-mail I get because the reaction of the listeners is always an instantaneous expression of sympathy for me and contempt for the poor critic.": "John",
  "I have a lot of sympathy with the ideas and frustration of the Occupy movement. I absolutely agree with the sense that Wall Street has brought an economic calamity to the middle class and that no one has been held accountable.": "Susan",
  "Kindliness and sympathy, fellowship and understanding, are always good, but best when they come from a distant corner of the world.": "Archibald",

  "He bit his lip in a manner which immediately awakened my maternal sympathy, and I helped him bite it.": "S.",

  "Queen Paola and I will never forget the ties that have grown between the people and us during the course of the years. Thank you for your confidence, tokens of sympathy and support, sometimes even with a little criticism. We always loved you.": "Albert",
  "Grief is a normal and natural response to loss. It is originally an unlearned feeling process. Keeping grief inside increases your pain.": "Anne",
  "I didn't feel any remorse or sympathy if I injured a rival. I went over the top a few times but I never broke anyone's leg.": "Peter",

  "Sympathy with nature is part of a good person's religion.": "Francis",
  "I'm completely indifferent to what genre I read provided that I feel sympathy with how a writer perceives being alive in the world.": "Thomas",
  "Unfair discrimination exists whether we like it or not; I wouldn't have married a gum-chewing vegetarian. Ultimately, we'll help the people we discriminate against if we try to understand more about them; genetics will lead to a world where there is a sympathy for the underdog.": "John",
  "Captain Hale, alone, without sympathy or support, save that from above, on the near approach of death asked for a clergyman to attend him. It was refused. He then requested a Bible; that too was refused by his inhuman jailer.": "William",
  "I have the greatest sympathy with the growth of the socialist party. I think they understand the evils that surround us and hammer them into people's minds better than we Liberals.": "Charles",
  "Gratitude can transform common days into thanksgivings, turn routine jobs into joy, and change ordinary opportunities into blessings.": "William",
  "Some memories are unforgettable, remaining ever vivid and heartwarming!": "Joseph",

  "I am grateful for what I am and have. My thanksgiving is perpetual.": "Henry",
  "Gratitude is the inward feeling of kindness received. Thankfulness is the natural impulse to express that feeling. Thanksgiving is the following of that impulse.": "Henry",

  "Over and over I marvel at the blessings of my life: Each year has grown better than the last.": "Lawrence",
  "I think that is a better thing than thanksgiving: thanks-living. How is this to be done? By a general cheerfulness of manner, by an obedience to the command of Him by whose mercy we live, by a perpetual, constant delighting of ourselves in the Lord, and by a submission of our desires to His will.": "Charles",
  "Pride slays thanksgiving, but a humble mind is the soil out of which thanks naturally grow. A proud man is seldom a grateful man, for he never thinks he gets as much as he deserves.": "Henry",
  "We're getting ready to sit down at the table and have Thanksgiving, and there's people that are not with their families. There are people that are in dangerous areas, putting their lives on the line to keep our country free, and I think that's something we should all celebrate every day.": "Guy",
  "My cooking is so bad my kids thought Thanksgiving was to commemorate Pearl Harbor.": "Phyllis",
  "There is one day that is ours. Thanksgiving Day is the one day that is purely American.": "O.",
  "What a marvelous resource soup is for the thrifty cook - it solves the ham-bone and lamb-bone problems, the everlasting Thanksgiving turkey, the extra vegetables.": "Julia",

  "I've seen terrorism close up, but I don't live in a state of terror at all. I'm comfortable going to the Manhattan Thanksgiving Day Parade, the tree lighting at Rockefeller Center, Times Square on New Years Eve. For perspective, the world today is a safer place than it was during the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Berlin Airlift, World War II.": "Douglas",
  "Thanksgiving just gets me all warm and tingly and all kinds of wonderful inside.": "Willard",

  "My parents came from little, so they made a choice to give a lot: buying turkeys for homeless shelters at Thanksgiving, delivering meals to people in hospices, giving spare change to those asking for it.": "Meghan",
  "Thanksgiving was always a favorite holiday for me. The preparation was fun! My grandma and I would walk to the butcher on Jamaica Avenue in Queens, order the bird, and buy all the fixings at the market.": "Debi",
  "My mother loved entertaining, and I've followed suit, so we have big celebrations for New Year, Passover, Thanksgiving and birthdays.": "Joan",
  "I was introduced to the Turducken in New Orleans. And it wasn't Thanksgiving. Glenn at the Gourmet Butcher Block brought it by, and I had never heard of it or had seen one, and they put it in the booth, and it smelled so good that I had to taste it. And it was good. Then Thanksgiving came, and we got one in addition to the traditional turkey.": "John",
  "As governor, when I visited our troops in Kuwait and Iraq, I served them Thanksgiving dinner. It was a small gesture compared to their sacrifice.": "Jennifer",
  "One of the best parts of Thanksgiving for me is re-watching some of the classic holiday blunders that have been depicted on television. I remember laughing uncontrollably on the set of 'That Girl' back in 1967 when we shot the episode, 'Thanksgiving Comes But Once A Year, Hopefully' during our second season.": "Marlo",
  "Let's say you go to a friend's wedding, or Thanksgiving, or Halloween. It'd be great the next day to see what went on with your friends' Thanksgiving weekend, or all the costumes they wore on Halloween, and be able to look back and see what they wore the year before, and the year before that.": "Mike",
  "Something I didn't even know was on my bucket list has been achieved. I have cooked Thanksgiving dinner with Martha Stewart. I vow to follow the gospel of her teachings and do my very best in the remarkably less glamorous kitchen of my own home... without the luxury of magically appearing prep bowls filled by a staff of sous chefs.": "Jesse",
  "On Thanksgiving Night, 1942, when I was fifteen years old, white racists burned our house to the ground.": "Coretta",
  "Since 1981, I've spent every Thanksgiving Day broadcasting a game, and it is one of my favorite days. You can say, 'Woe is me, I never get to be part of the tradition,' or you can say, 'Heck, we've got our own tradition, and it's pretty good.'": "John",
  "The more I come to recognize my story's place in God's grander Story, my once-bewildered questions are turning to psalms of thanksgiving at the wonder that I have been included in what He is doing.": "Gloria",
  "Shopmas now begins on Thanksgiving Day. Apparently, escaping the families you cannot stand to spend another minute with on Thanksgiving Day to go buy them gifts is how some Americans show their affection for one another. Weird.": "Barry",
  "Thanksgiving is a season that is very much in accord with the themes and teachings of Jesus Christ.": "John",
  "When people come to my act any time after Thanksgiving, I usually say, You shouldn't be here. You should be shopping. Our economy depends on you! You should be out there buying stuff.'": "Lewis",
  "Christians were instructed to serve others, and the thanksgiving was for the grace of God and the fact that God offered a way for man to return to a positive relationship with Him.": "John",
  "My mom makes something called green pie, which I thought was a delicacy that many people only had at Thanksgiving, but it turns out it was just Jell-O with whipped cream on it. And it's delicious.": "Bobby",
  "I miss both of my parents terribly every day, but especially as we approach Thanksgiving. We always came together as a family for that holiday, playing capture the flag and touch football and laughing a lot.": "Mark",
  "Halloween is fun, but it wasn't always my favorite holiday. I think Thanksgiving is my favorite holiday.": "Tobin",
  "Where I grew up, I could be a punk rocker and a jock. But in college, it became apparent that those two worlds didn't mix. When I brought my guitar back to school after Thanksgiving break, a friend handed me his bass and said, 'Listen to the Ramones.'": "Jeff",
  "It's like being at the kids' table at Thanksgiving - you can put your elbows on it, you don't have to talk politics... no matter how old I get, there's always a part of me that's sitting there.": "John",
  "There are three things that people pick up on the instant they walk into your home on Thanksgiving. They will be able to feel the human energy. They'll smell the food. And they will see, instantly, the table.": "Danny",
  "Being an Ethiopian-born, Swedish-raised chef, there's nothing traditional about my Thanksgiving spread.": "Marcus",
  "I think Thanksgiving is the perfect occasion to break open a buttery, oaky Chardonnay from California.": "Gavin",
  "It's a bit of a sore spot, the Thanksgiving in Indian country.": "Robbie",
  "Even if you are vegetarian, you do want to have a stuffing for Thanksgiving. The stuffing is not so much about the vegetables, but it's very unique to the season.": "Daniel",
  "My favorite meal is turkey and mashed potatoes. I love Thanksgiving, it's just my favorite. I can have Thanksgiving all year round.": "Cindy",
  "Agriculture is a business that has been up to its bib overalls in politics since the first Thanksgiving dinner kickback to the Indians for subsidizing Pilgrim maize production with fish head fertilizer grants.": "P.",
  "I started acting in second grade - my first role was in the Thanksgiving play. I was the Indian chasing the turkey. All the other mom's encouraged my mom to get me into acting after that. Also, when I saw 'The Sound of Music' at Music Circus, I knew I wanted to act.": "Brie",
  "Thanksgiving is one of my favorite American traditions. I quickly picked it up when I moved to the U.S. from Sweden.": "Marcus",
  "Thanksgiving is probably my favorite holiday - it's a day that's American to the core and it's a day that's all about what and how we eat.": "Marcus",
  "There was a time, in the not so distant past, that if you didn't have what you needed on Thanksgiving, you were pretty much going to have to wait until Friday. Not anymore!": "Monica",
  "My mum, Helen, was hilarious. She had a tremendous sense of humour and was a great singer and tap dancer. For many years, she was the voice of Minnie Mouse in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. She would be in the float as it came along, singing whatever the Minnie Mouse song of the day was. She was a really big spirit in my life.": "Billy",
  "When I was about nine years old, I announced to my mother that I was going to cook Thanksgiving dinner. And I went to the library and got this whole pile of books. I'd love to say it all turned out great. It didn't. But, sort of, from that point on, whenever there was serious cooking at home, I was the one who did it.": "Nathan",
  "As much as I love crisp, clean whites, there's always a time for rich but balanced Chardonnays with oak, especially at Thanksgiving.": "Gary",
  "I would love four children because I have a very small family, so I want those big Thanksgiving dinners.": "Chrissy",
  "Lets talk about the holidays, more specifically, consumption during the holidays. If it's true that 'We are what we eat,' most of us would be unrecognizable during the period that ranges from the night before Thanksgiving through that day in early January when everyone decides to return to the gym.": "Rachel",
  "I always love the soapy conflicts between somebody's family of origin and their new family - 'Do I have Thanksgiving at my husband's parents' house, or at my parents' house?'": "Jill",
  "We all have somebody that sits down at the Thanksgiving table and says the most outrageous things, and you're doin' the dishes with your sister, and you're like, 'Omigod, can you believe she said that?'": "Vicki",
  "As a kid, I was always mad - just noticing the women at Thanksgiving, running around the kitchen, while the men were watching football. For one, I don't want to cook, and for two, I hate football. I was stuck in the middle.": "Beth",
  "Berries have a lot of soluble fiber. That's why they gel up when you're making your Thanksgiving cranberry sauce, with the pectin.": "Michael",
  "I like to decide the night before Thanksgiving that I'm gonna do it, and I'll see what riff raff is around. Then I get that last-minute surge of energy. But if I had two weeks to plan, sometimes I wish I wasn't doing it. But very seldom does that happen.": "Amy",
  "On the morning of Thanksgiving, I would wake up to the home smelling of all good things, wafting upstairs to my room. I would set the table with the fancy silverware and china and hope that my parents and grandmother wouldn't have the annual Thanksgiving fight about Richard Nixon.": "Debi",
  "Thanksgiving is the only day of the year when most of the stores here are closed during the day and reopen after midnight. Even restaurants shut down for the holiday, except for the fast-food chains.": "Sayed",
  "If no one shopped on Thanksgiving Day, the stores wouldn't open. End of story. I say we all take the pledge and stay home. Thanksgiving is a day to give thanks for what you have, not to save a few dollars to get more.": "Regina",
  "I loved my mom so much because she had to work on a penny just to put food on the table... During the Depression in the United States, everybody had a tough time. And I was so hurt because she was crying that she didn't have any food for us for Thanksgiving.": "Tony",
  "A lot of Thanksgiving days have been ruined by not carving the turkey in the kitchen.": "Kin",
  "When I was just starting out in the business, I used to love to watch Lorne Greene doing the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade. I said right then, 'That's what I want to do someday,' and it's been one dream that has come true.": "Willard",
  "Throughout its history, the members of Shearith Israel have observed Thanksgiving by reciting in synagogue the same psalms of praise and gratitude sung by Jews all over the world on festive days like Hanukkah.": "Meir",
  "I've always had fond memories of cooking Thanksgiving.": "Wylie",
  "My whole problem is that all of my favorite things at Thanksgiving are the starches, and everyone is trying to go low-carb this year, even a green vegetable has carbs in it.": "Ted",
  "Not to sound too much like Christopher Guest in 'Waiting for Guffman,' but on Thanksgiving you're putting on a show!": "Ted",
  "It wasn't the traditional cooking most people do. For me, as a young chef, Thanksgiving meant going to work in the kitchen at places like Gotham, JoJo and Jean-Georges.": "Wylie",
  "I really don't do much on the night of Thanksgiving other than bring the wine and carve the turkey. My contribution comes the day after, in the form of breakfast. I usually just forage through the leftovers for things that will go well with eggs.": "Wylie",
  "I love chicken. I would eat chicken fingers on Thanksgiving if it were socially acceptable.": "Todd",
  "It's so warm now, and Thanksgiving came so early - is it just me, or does it not really feel like Ramadan?": "David",
  "Holiday binge-buying has deep roots in American culture: department stores have been associating turkey gluttony with its spending equivalent since they began sponsoring Thanksgiving Day parades in the early 20th century.": "Adam",
  "Thanksgiving, our eminent moral holiday, doesn't have much for children. At its heart are conversation, food, drink, and fellowship - all perks of adulthood.": "Rosecrans",
  "The craft Emmys are kind of the kids' table at Thanksgiving. You're not really invited to the big dance. It's still really, really exciting, and the statue still counts.": "Hank",
  "I've spent a lot of Thanksgivings on the road with my band, so anytime that I can spend Thanksgiving with my family in a traditional aspect, eating sweet potatoes and cranberries and stuffing and all the trappings of Thanksgiving and then get on a treadmill the next day extra long, I'm happy.": "Richie",
  "North Carolina was where you could have Thanksgiving and feel like it was Thanksgiving.": "David",
  "My son was born during my last semester in college. His due date was Thanksgiving, but he didn't show up until finals week. I brought my books to the hospital and didn't think anything of it. That is what a father is supposed to do.": "LZ",

  "Over the Thanksgiving holiday I took time to reflect on what is most important to me and realized I need to find a way to put the fun back into racing.": "Kurt",
  "My restaurants are never opened on Thanksgiving; I want my staff to spend time with their family if they can. My feeling is, if I can't figure out how to make money the rest of the year so that my workers can enjoy the holidays, then I don't deserve to be an owner.": "Michael",
  "I don't think any other holiday embraces the food of the Midwest quite like Thanksgiving. There's roasted meat and mashed potatoes. But being here is also about heritage. Cleveland is really a giant melting pot - not only is my family a melting pot, but so is the city.": "Michael",
  "There is no racial or ethnic involvement in Thanksgiving, and people who may be very distant from the Christian system can see the beauty and the positive spirit that comes from the holiday.": "John",
  "Under the new government of the Constitution, beginning in 1789, all of the peacetime measures were repeated: chaplains, prayers, memorials of Thanksgiving, the Northwest Ordinance, funding for the Christian education of Indians.": "M.",
  "One of my most memorable Thanksgiving memories was probably the first year that me and my two brothers decided to start our annual eating contest. We ate throughout the whole day. We started that morning and weighed ourselves, and at the very end of the night, we weighed ourselves out. And all three of us equally gained five pounds.": "Charles",
  "From the beginning, the Continental Congress had official chaplains, prayers, and days of fasting and Thanksgiving. When sessions opened in 1774, fear was voiced that the religious diversity of the country would make it hard to choose a form of worship.": "M.",
  "In deference to American traditions, my family put our oven to rare use at Thanksgiving during my childhood, with odd roast-turkey experiments involving sticky-rice stuffing or newfangled basting techniques that we read about in magazines.": "Jennifer",
  "Thank God for YouTube. Every Thanksgiving, I'm bombarded with 'Turkey Lurkey Time.'": "Donna",
  "I know, especially in my family, people's feelings get hurt over the tiniest things. I'm sure that's true in every family. But, for instance, one year, I came a little bit late to Thanksgiving, and I was supposed to bring a salad. And I just brought a bag of lettuce, and put it in a bowl. Five years later, I heard that my mom was incensed.": "Jonathan",
  "I make a fabulous tofurkey for Thanksgiving. My Mexican-Italian family can't tell the difference.": "Christian",
  "I'm not from the States, so Thanksgiving, for me, was never a huge tradition.": "Daniela",
  "I'm vegetarian, but I love Thanksgiving dinner: faux turkey, stuffing and mashed potatoes.": "Leigh",
  "I'm a big cook and prefer to make meals at home when I can. I'm either cooking, or we're going to a drive-through somewhere. I'm really proud of my homemade sweet potato pie. At Thanksgiving I make five of them because they go quick.": "Chandra",
  "I'm blessed to come from a family with five brothers. We're all physical and athletic and like to work out, like to be outside, like to throw the ball around. We spent our entire childhoods on some kind of corner or in a field. We still do a Turkey Bowl every Thanksgiving. It gets competitive, man. Bloody.": "Danny",
  "I think I'm going to give my baby her first food on Thanksgiving, make her some organic sweet potato. I'm very excited! It's going to be a big day and my husband is in charge of the turkey - he's the chef of the family!": "Lily",
  "When I first sat down with my oncologist the day before Thanksgiving, and she told me I would need 8 rounds of chemo, one of my first questions admittedly was: 'Will I lose my hair?' It sounds shallow, I know, but it was a very scary image to me.": "Amy",
  "In our family, mom and dad are Longhorns, our first two kids are Aggies and we're hoping our last one is a Longhorn. It gives us family fun on Thanksgiving Day.": "Bob",
  "I have nothing against turkey. We eat turkey for Thanksgiving in my house.": "Marc",
  "Homemade stuffing is my favorite thing about Thanksgiving. I wish people served it more than just once a year.": "Troy",
  "I am originally from Florida. So Thanksgiving was always something I really looked forward to, because I got to travel back home every year and see everyone all at once, around one big happy table.": "Troy",
  "Your positive action combined with positive thinking results in success.": "Shiv",
  "Live life to the fullest, and focus on the positive.": "Matt",
  "I truly believe that everything that we do and everyone that we meet is put in our path for a purpose.

  "Your smile will give you a positive countenance that will make people feel comfortable around you.": "Les",
  "You cannot have a positive life and a negative mind.": "Joyce",
  "Find a place inside where there's joy, and the joy will burn out the pain.": "Joseph",
  "Successful people maintain a positive focus in life no matter what is going on around them. They stay focused on their past successes rather than their past failures, and on the next action steps they need to take to get them closer to the fulfillment of their goals rather than all the other distractions that life presents to them.": "Jack",
  "No matter what you're going through, there's a light at the end of the tunnel and it may seem hard to get to it but you can do it and just keep working towards it and you'll find the positive side of things.": "Demi",
  "You're going to go through tough times - that's life. But I say, 'Nothing happens to you, it happens for you.' See the positive in negative events.": "Joel",

  "My dad was a very quiet person, and unbelievably tough. But my grandmother gave me my first look at negative thinking to bring about positive results.

  "'Yes' is the mother of all positive words, next to 'love.' Maybe 'love' is the father of all positive words.": "Jason",

  "I never want to record something that I'm not proud of just because I think it might be a big hit. There's no positive about that because if you record a song you hate and it's a big hit, then you're singing a song every night that you hate.

  "You don't have to be positive all the time.": "Amy",

  "The main point of democracy is to deliver positive results for the majority.": "Chrystia",
  "Kids need role models, whether it's baseball players, actors or musicians: people to bring a little positive light into their hearts and minds. We need to be a little kinder to those people because it's not easy being that role model, looked upon as something we are all incapable of being - too perfect.": "David",
  "Saudi Arabia isn't the enemy, but it is a problem. It could make so much positive difference in the Islamic world if it used its status to soothe Sunni-Shiite tensions and encourage tolerance.

  "I like to accept it all, the negative and the positive.": "Alek",

  "If you look at the history of technology over a couple hundred years, it's all about time compression and making the globe smaller. It's had positive effects, all the ones that we know.

  "There's a certain darkness to Slipknot, but at the same time, there's a very strong dose of positivity. Stone Sour is the same way.

But these aspects do not make one forget the disastrous effects of the industrial and commercial process of 'cultural lamination' that the USA is perpetrating on the planet.": "Jose",
  "I never appreciated 'positive heroes' in literature. They are almost always cliches, copies of copies, until the model is exhausted.

  "About the most exciting thing a baby can do is burp - I've spent hours of my life holding a baby on my shoulder and patting its back, trying to loosen up a burp.

  "Healthy children are born from healthy, respected, well-nourished and educated mothers and it is imperative that they have a voice in the decisions which affect them. If you empower a mother and let her have her say towards a poverty-free future, the positive impact this would have on ending hunger will be immense.": "Dionne",

  "The best thing to do when you find yourself in a hurting or vulnerable place is to surround yourself with the strongest, finest, most positive people you know.": "Kristin",
  "To protect people's lives and keep our children safe, we must implement public-works spending and do so proudly.

  "When you think positively, you attract positive people. If I'm on a mission to be successful, and I'm positive all the time, then more positive people will come around me, and we'll help each other. If you're negative, you'll find yourself surrounded by negative people.": "Astro",

  "People dwell so much on the little things, but why should they hold you back when you have the big things to look forward to?

  "An external electric field, meeting it and passing through it, affects the negative as much as the positive quanta of the atom, and pushes the former to one side, and the latter in the other direction.": "Johannes",
  "Oscar is the exact opposite of how I think you should behave. I just think of it as a negative view of the positive mind I have.

  "You know you're getting old when you get that one candle on the cake. It's like, 'See if you can blow this out.'": "Jerry",
  "There are three hundred and sixty-four days when you might get un-birthday presents, and only one for birthday presents, you know.": "Lewis",
  "My policy on cake is pro having it and pro eating it.": "Boris",

  "Love the giver more than the gift.": "Brigham",
  "Motorcycle riding has been a passion of mine since my 20th birthday, and as a proud member of the American Motorcyclist Association and the Harley Owners Group, I can attest that responsible riding has many unique recreational benefits for millions of Americans.": "Tim",
  "I wanted to be the next Dana Carvey. This was my ultimate goal. If I ever cut into a birthday cake and made a wish, I would wish to be on 'Saturday Night Live.' If I threw a coin into a fountain, I would wish to be on 'Saturday Night Live.' If I saw a shooting star, I would wish to be on 'Saturday Night Live.'": "Jimmy",
  "I don't pay attention to the number of birthdays. It's weird when I say I'm 53. It just is crazy that I'm 53. I think I'm very immature. I feel like a kid. That's why my back goes out all the time, because I completely forget I can't do certain things anymore - like doing the plank for 10 minutes.": "Ellen",
  "People give one another things that can't be gift wrapped.": "Nadine",
  "I kept a diary right after I was born. Day 1: Tired from the move. Day 2: Everyone thinks I'm an idiot.": "Steven",
  "I turned 40 on the set of the reunion show for 'Sheer Genius,' so it wasn't a hideous birthday because I had everyone on the cast and crew sing 'Happy Birthday' to me, and I won $10,000 for being the fan favorite. It was really liberating to turn 40 and realize that I felt very comfortable with myself and knew who I was.": "Tabatha",
  "My mother's face floated to mind, a pale, reproachful moon, at her last and first visit to the asylum since my twentieth birthday. A daughter in an asylum! I had done that to her. Still, she had obviously decided to forgive me.": "Sylvia",
  "If you can give your child only one gift, let it be enthusiasm.": "Bruce",
  "If I have the power to post 'Happy Birthday' on someone's Facebook page and make them feel really good, it feels really good to make other people feel really good. I love it. I'm a huge Facebook and Twitter person. And I love talking to my fans. It's fun.": "Rebecca",
  "I have an ambivalent relationship with Margaret Thatcher. She came to power in May 1979 - a month before my 11th birthday. I was far too young to have developed a great deal of political awareness. I remember it, though - my mother excited at the dinner table because Britain had its first female prime minister.": "Sara",
  "One of my favorite memories was one time Prince picked me up and said we were going to Michael Jordan's birthday party.": "Tamron",
  "About 50 percent of the songs on the radio are like, 'Live like tomorrow doesn't exist. Like it's my birthday. Like it's the last day of my life'... Such a large percentage of pop music is really about party time.": "Sia",
  "Every day, every birthday candle I blow out, every penny I throw over my shoulder in a wishing well, every time my daughter says, 'Let's make a wish on a star,' there's one thing I wish for: wisdom.": "Rene",
  "I would watch 'The Ed Sullivan Show' and borrow a few lines here and there from guests like Red Buttons and Buddy Hackett to create a routine. Then I started getting invited to do political functions like the governor's birthday ball or mayor's dinner.": "Norm",
  "It is lovely, when I forget all birthdays, including my own, to find that somebody remembers me.": "Ellen",
  "I decided if you're lucky enough to be alive, you should use each birthday to celebrate what your life is about.": "Mary",
  "My parents screened 'Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory' for my 6th birthday, and I became fascinated by the idea of living in a candy land with chocolate rivers and lollipop trees.": "Dylan",
  "It was on my fifth birthday that Papa put his hand on my shoulder and said, 'Remember, my son, if you ever need a helping hand, you'll find one at the end of your arm.'": "Sam",
  "A gift, with a kind countenance, is a double present.": "Thomas",
  "I love a card. You know, cards? At birthdays? I collect them.": "Adele",
  "I like birthday cake. It's so symbolic. It's a tempting symbol to load with something more complicated than just 'Happy birthday!' because it's this emblem of childhood and a happy day.": "Aimee",
  "It is ironic that the one thing that all religions recognize as separating us from our creator, our very self-consciousness, is also the one thing that divides us from our fellow creatures. It was a bitter birthday present from evolution.": "Annie",
  "I was honoured when they asked me to appear at the president's birthday rally in Madison Square Garden. There was like a hush over the whole place when I came on to sing 'Happy Birthday,' like if I had been wearing a slip, I would have thought it was showing or something. I thought, 'Oh, my gosh, what if no sound comes out!'": "Marilyn",
  "I'm most comfortable in my birthday suit.": "Amanda",
  "When someone asks if you'd like cake or pie, why not say you want cake and pie?": "Lisa",
  "At her birthday, my seven-year-old daughter will say that she wants these big cakes and certain expensive toys as presents, and I can't say no to her. It would just break my heart. But when I was little, for birthdays we just played outside and we were happy if we got any cake.": "Goran",
  "The reason I met my husband was because I remembered a friend's birthday. The moral of the story is: Remember people's birthdays.": "Julianna",

  "My every birthday wish was, 'I want to someday be on TV.'": "Awkwafina",
  "I've never looked forward to a birthday like I'm looking forward to my new daughter's birthday, because two days after that is when I can apply for reinstatement.": "Pete",
  "I love photography. My boyfriend's got a great camera, which I bought for his birthday.": "Sarah",
  "The turning point was when I hit my 30th birthday. I thought, if really want to write, it's time to start. I picked up the book How to Write a Novel in 90 Days. The author said to just write three pages a day, and I figured, I can do this. I never got past Page 3 of that book.": "James",
  "I love having my birthday at Australia Zoo.": "Bindi",
  "I'll never forget my 24th birthday when my tooth got punched out. And for a second I was like, it would be really hilarious if I sold it on eBay. But I can't, that's just too creepy. I don't think I can go there.": "Evan",
  "In the Mexican culture, we never miss a baptism, a birthday, a baby shower, a wedding shower, a wedding. You must show up. Otherwise, you'll be in big trouble.": "Eva",
  "When I was six, my best friend's parents bought him a piano. My mother noticed that every time I would go to his house, the first thing I would say to him was 'Levester' - His name was Levester - I said, 'Levester, can I go play your piano?' So, on my 7th birthday, my parents bought me a piano.": "Herbie",
  "I always knew that good stuff would come along when I was older. So when I was 18, I longed to be 30; when I was 30, I longed to be 50. I've always looked forward to my next birthday.": "Joanna",
  "I've never really made a big deal out of my birthday.": "Nikki",
  "On my 50th birthday in 2005, my discount-wielding AARP card came in the mail. I hurled it in the trash, put on something fabulous, and had a decadent meal. Just the thought of putting it in my wallet felt like a concession.": "Iman",
  "Our kids will never have to remember things, because it's all in pictures. Want to remember your fourth birthday? There'll be video of it on your phone.": "Jason",
  "I love the Sixties with Julie Christie and Jane Birkin - those natural English beauties. That's the look that is most me, when I wore the tight-to-the knee dresses. I don't think I bleached my hair until I was 20. I like experimenting for big occasions, though. You've always got to do a bit of a number for the birthday!": "Kate",
  "I've never hosted a party in my life, not even my own birthday party. I'd feel really uncomfortable saying, 'Hey everybody, let's celebrate me!' But I'm not antisocial. I don't hate people.": "Alessia",
  "As a kid, I would wake up, and there'd be a jazz funeral while I'm walking to school. And when I come home, you can find Rebirth band playing for a birthday party the same day.": "Trombone",
  "Washington's birthday is worthy of celebration - he is one of the greatest men in history. But Washington himself would likely have seen celebration of the office of the presidency itself as monarchic in nature.": "Ben",
  "I did not have a normal life. I'd be training when my sister would be at birthday parties and sleepovers. I finished high school by correspondence, basically working two full-time jobs. The last years were very, very tough. But I was willing to do that. It's all about sacrifice.": "Eugenie",
  "I love getting scared. I find myself putting myself in situations like haunted houses or going to a haunted hospital for my birthday. Yes, I've actually done that.": "Selena",
  "I'm not a big birthday guy I never have been. ": "Lewis",
  "I left school on my 15th birthday.": "David",
  "I saw a man killed in front of my eyes just before my eighth birthday.": "Peter",
  "I got my first tennis racket on my seventh birthday. And because we had a tennis court in our backyard, I played every day. By ten I was playing competitively.": "Tullian",
  "I'm not a birthday person. Maybe because I don't like to build expectations around that one day. You never know how it'll turn out to be.": "Ranbir",
  "When I was 13 or 14, my mother used to gift me books that I was dying to read. Those are my most memorable birthday gifts.": "Kajol",
  "Ask any teenage girl to describe her perfect bedroom, and you'll get answers like 'a room with a private phone line, a place to hang out with friends, and for it to be way-cool and funky.' Ask parents the same question, and 'a locked door that opens on their 21st birthday' might top the list!": "Candice",
  "When I was 11, I had an Ugly Sister birthday party. All my idea. Most girls want to be a fairy or a princess, but there I am with beauty spots and fur and fluorescent pink kiss-curls.": "Lucy",
  "I'm in a difficult position in the sense that, preposterous as this might sound, I don't like being the centre of attention. I get up on stage every night and play songs, but I almost feel the songs are the centre of attention. I don't like opening my birthday presents in front of people, either.": "Alex",
  "I was born full grown in the middle of a hurricane and an earthquake on 10 September 1954, 12.52 P.M. When I found out that I had missed lunch, I gave such a shout that the Earth stopped and spun backwards two days. That's why I celebrate my birthday on 8 September.": "Jon",
  "My birthday is Feb. 11, and I'm both excited and not excited by it. You'll never be 15 again, and you really, really need to savor every day like it's your last.": "Q'orianka",
  "I sing a little bit. I got a guitar for my 16th birthday.": "Jesse",
  "On my 30th birthday, all the presents I got were boxes of food. That's what I needed.": "Kay",
  "I wrote 'The Room', 'The Birthday Party', and 'The Dumb Waiter' in 1957, I was acting all the time in a repertory company, doing all kinds of jobs, traveling to Bournemouth and Torquay and Birmingham.": "Harold",
  "I am a big popcorn fanatic. I love popcorn. In fact one year for my birthday, my husband bought me one of those big popcorn machines like they have in movie theaters.": "Debbie",
  "I'm not going to be caught around here for any fool celebration. To hell with birthdays!": "Norman",
  "I had Hallowe'en parties every year, as it was my birthday five days before. My parents would actually put prosthetic noses on, and my dad would wear a top-hat and tails, put on a fake curly moustache, and hold a pipe.": "Bat",
  "It's odd the things that people remember. Parents will arrange a birthday party, certain it will stick in your mind forever. You'll have a nice time, then two years later you'll be like, 'There was a pony there? Really? And a clown with one leg?'": "David",
  "I binge when I'm happy. When everything is going really well, every day is like I'm at a birthday party.": "Kirstie",
  "The return of my birthday, if I remember it, fills me with thoughts which it seems to be the general care of humanity to escape.": "Samuel",
  "I have had fans make me the big picture collages of the photo books I have had fans send me birthday cakes... sing to me on my voicemail. I have had fans flash me. I have had older fans give me their bras and underwear onstage. ": "Sean",
  "I have 'Happy Birthday' in multiple languages on my iPod - I like to play it at company birthday parties.": "Yigal",
  "Nicole will come up in conversations where it's in a part of the conversation. Or we may be somewhere and I would tell some story about their mother and I. You know, we always honor her birthday.": "O.",
  "I can't make eye contact when people sing 'Happy Birthday' to me.": "Dove",
  "I'm trying to get the record that I made at my birthday party last year, trying to get that out, and the lawyers are diddling around with it and it probably won't be out until next year. I don't know.": "Marian",
  "As I approached my 95th birthday, I was burdened to write a book that addressed the epidemic of 'easy believism.' There is a mindset today that if people believe in God and do good works, they are going to Heaven.": "Billy",
  "All my grandchildren bake. On a Saturday, Annabel's boys, Louis and Toby, always bake. Louis makes a chocolate cake, Toby makes banana or lemon drizzle. They're 12 and 10, and they can do it totally on their own. My son's twin girls, Abby and Grace, are 14; they make birthday cakes and like to do it on their own with Mum out of the way.": "Mary",
  "I saw Farrah Fawcett originally when she and her boyfriend, Lee Majors, came over to my house for a birthday party that I was having for my ex-wife, Leigh Taylor-Young.": "Ryan",
  "I'm not materialistic. I believe in presents from the heart, like a drawing that a child does.": "Victoria",
  "I can put my legs behind my head and sing 'Happy Birthday.' Because that's something that me and my friends used to do when we were in gymnastics class as kids, and I can still do it. I was doing it since I was 8 and 9. They used to call me Gumby. Very bendy.": "Emmy",
  "I hate birthdays. I thought that I only hated my own birthday, and then I realized that I hate my children's birthdays too.": "Samantha",
  "We all have special numbers in our lives, and 4 is that for me. It's the day I was born. My mother's birthday, and a lot of my friends' birthdays, are on the fourth; April 4 is my wedding date.": "Beyonce",
  "Only then, approaching my fortieth birthday, I made philosophy my life's work.": "Karl",
  "Handmade presents are scary because they reveal that you have too much free time.": "Douglas",
  "When I auditioned for drama college, they asked me to do my Shakespeare. I couldn't do it. They asked me to do my modern, and I couldn't do it. They asked me if I had a song prepared, and I said 'No,' so I sang 'Happy Birthday.' And I did a reasonable improvisation, a reasonable one, nothing special at all. I don't know how I got in, but I did.": "Hans",
  "I worked at an ice cream parlor called Chadwicks. We wore old-timey outfits and had to bang a drum, play a kazoo, and sing 'Happy Birthday' to people while giving them free birthday sundaes. Lots of ice cream scooping and $1 tips.": "Amy",
  "My parents were dishonest people. If it was my birthday, I knew my mother took me to the K-Mart and she stole my toy. She'd put it in the shopping cart and we'd walk out. I was raised with that.": "Vincent",
  "I wear jewellery that I never take off. I have a ring and two necklaces. I always have them on and get scared when I have to take them off for photo shoots. The ring is my mum's mum's mum's, and she gave it to me for my 18th birthday. The necklace is the same one that my sister has. She's called Hannah, and the name is the chain.": "Zara",
  "I once attended a birthday party where Danny Kaye dropped in to entertain the birthday boy and his guests I was sometimes taken for lunch on Saturdays by my father to The Brown Derby and my favorite meal is still the Cobb salad in the Polo Lounge of the Beverly Hills Hotel. ": "Michael",
  "If Congress can move President's Day, Columbus Day and, alas, Martin Luther King's Birthday celebration for the convenience of shoppers, shouldn't they at least consider moving Election Day for the convenience of voters?": "Andrew",
  "Some people won't go the extra mile, and then on their birthday, when no one makes a fuss, they feel neglected and bitter.": "Anne",
  "I have angel wings and a halo on my wrist, which I got done on my 30th birthday in memory of my brother.": "Sheridan",
  "In 1993 my birthday present was a star on Hollywood's Walk of Fame.": "Annette",
  "I was forced to live far beyond my years when just a child, now I have reversed the order and I intend to remain young indefinitely.": "Mary",
  "For my birthday I got a humidifier and a de-humidifier... I put them in the same room and let them fight it out.": "Steven",
  "My ace in the hole as a human being used to be my capacity for remembering birthdays. I worked at it. Whenever I made a new friend, I made a point of finding out his or her birthday early on, and I would record it in my Filofax calendar.": "Susan",
  "Citizens, thank you for all your birthday wishes. I am 88 years old today and still lucky to live in the greatest city in the world.": "Ed",
  "I started running around my 30th birthday. I wanted to lose weight; I didn't anticipate the serenity. Being in motion, suddenly my body was busy and so my head could work out some issues I had swept under a carpet of wine and cheese. Good therapy, that's a good run.": "Michael",
  "And I was very shy as a kid; if you sang me 'Happy Birthday,' I would cry. Quite shy. So the idea of being an actor, much less a model, was just out of this world.": "Cody",
  "Yes, I am scared of prison. It's the last thing if you are after building up a business over 38 years and you are approaching your 66th birthday and you never owed a man a penny and you feel hard done by and you try to protect yourself and your family and go to prison - if that is the society we are living in, I am happy to accept that.": "Sean",
  "I threw my 20th birthday party at Brown, and I didn't even have to say to anyone not to put pictures on Facebook. Not a single picture went up. That was when I knew I'd found a solid group of friends, and I felt like I belonged.": "Emma",
  "If I have one wish for my birthday, it is that 35 is the end of desperation and the beginning of acceptance. Part of that is believing that if I'm meant to give birth, I will.": "Jessi",
  "I promised myself: Before your 18th birthday, you're going to be at Jean Paul Gaultier. And it worked. I was hired.": "Nicolas",
  "I love mayonnaise. Every birthday when I was a kid I'd go to Black Angus and just dip my burger in mayo.": "Blake",
  "The first comic book I ever read was an issue of 'Legion of Super-Heroes' where the earth was surrounded by all of these chains. I remember the cover I got it at a birthday party. ": "Jonathan",
  "My first paying job might have been doing a play, actually. My mom paid me to dress up as a flounder at my sister's 'Little Mermaid' - themed birthday party when I was little.": "Paul",
  "I'm really not the party type. I more like to have friends over at the house and chill. I've never been the super party type. But for the 18th birthday, you got to party. And then 21 is going to be even bigger.": "Jacob",
  "I can still remember the afternoon, on my 15th birthday, when I opened up 'The Virgin and the Gypsy,' D.H. Lawrence's novella, in my tiny cell in boarding school, and whole worlds of possibility opened out that I had never guessed existed. The language was on fire and sang of liberation.": "Pico",
  "I like to do special things for people. Any time someone has a birthday, I make them a really special cake that they all seem to love - it's a Coca-Cola cake.": "Kimberly",
  "I had a birthday party with my family and friends at a house, and Chipotle catered. It was beautiful.": "Ansel",
  "There's video footage of my 10th birthday where I'm wearing, like, a little pink T-shirt. Then my dad comes in brandishing a copy of 'Eraserhead,' going, 'Look what we've got for tonight!'": "Jane",
  "On my actual 16th birthday, on the actual day, I went home and I had chicken korma and Peshwari naan bread and pilau rice, and that was fantastic.": "Maisie",
  "Having a Mary Poppins-themed birthday party when I was 5 - all my friends went in dresses, and I went as a chimney sweep. I was a real tomboy.": "Poppy",
  "My great-grandmother lived to be 100 years old, so I got to know her. She always sent us birthday cards that had $2 bills inside - we kept them for good luck.": "Dana",
  "In 1980, shortly before my 11th birthday, I wrote my first essay in English.": "Pankaj",
  "I trained to be a priest - started to. I went to seminary school when I was 11. I wanted to be a priest, but when they told me I could never have sex, not even on my birthday, I changed my mind.": "Johnny",
  "I was in my mid-teens when someone gave me a copy of 'Pears Encyclopaedia of Myth and Legends' as a birthday present. It sat on my shelves for many months before I looked at it. When I did, I couldn't stop reading it.": "Tariq",
  "I have been a frequent air traveler since I was a few months shy of my sixth birthday, when my parents packed me off to boarding school two plane rides away from home. Those days of being willingly handed from air hostess to air hostess as an 'unaccompanied minor' made me blase about the rigors of air travel.": "Shashi",
  "I've been a Nick Cave fan since the early '80s when he was part of The Birthday Party thing singing Australian self-destructive rock band and I've always followed his work and loved it.": "Aleksandar",
  "An army environment is very protected, a walled city kind of environment, where everybody has the same income, you have the same birthday parties, you are given return gifts - everything is the same. Everybody is moving up at the same pace.": "Nimrat",
  "I've looked after my money. As I started working around my third birthday, my first check went straight to the bank.": "Samantha",
  "I got my first camera when I was 21 - my boyfriend gave it to me for my birthday - but at that point politics was my life, and I viewed the camera as a tool for expressing my political beliefs rather than as an art medium.": "Carrie",
  "Brilliantly lit from stem to stern, she looked like a sagging birthday cake.": "Walter",
  "In January 1962, when I was the author of one and a half unperformed plays, I attended a student production of 'The Birthday Party' at the Victoria Rooms in Bristol. Just before it began, I realised that Harold Pinter was sitting in front of me.": "Tom",
  "One of the shocks of a 50th birthday is realizing the fundamental fact that your youth is irrevocably over.": "Marianne",
  "I am the guy dressing up in, you know, the caveman outfit for the kids' birthday parties.": "Rob",
  "When I was younger, I was a rave kid trapped inside a singer/songwriter's body. But I kind of figured my way out because I started making these really terrible beats on this Yamaha keyboard that my parents got me for my 10th birthday.": "Charli",
  "Success happened little by little for me. I tasted the flavor of fame in small doses: I started at 10 years old when I won a music contest; I was performing at birthday parties, company meetings.": "Shakira",
  "Early on, when my wife and I were dating, we went to the grocery store, and I told her that sometimes I just buy birthday cakes, and I eat them. And she said: 'Really? I do, too.'": "Tom",
  "I first picked up a guitar when I was ten years old; my parents surprised me with it for my tenth birthday. I started taking lessons when I was thirteen, but only for a few months, and then I just kept teaching myself.": "Alessia",
  "I gave a funny speech at my wife's birthday party, and I'm thinking, 'Hey, I've still got it.'": "Larry",
  "The worst part about celebrating another birthday is the shock that you're only as well as you are.": "Anne",
  "I often go to bed in my birthday suit. But I like teddies and cute little undies that match. I like a sexy bra and panty set, or little shorts.": "Queen",
  "I never missed a birthday. I never missed a school play. We carpooled. And the greatest compliment I can ever get is not about my career or performance or anything; it's when people say, 'You know, your girls are great.' That's the real thing for me.": "Billy",
  "Nicole Richie invited me to her birthday party, and it was at Michael Jackson's Neverland!": "Gaby",
  "There are two kinds of people in crisis situations - those who fight and those who freeze. I'm a freezer, and that's just going by the couple of surprise birthday parties I've had thrown for me.": "Cobie",
  "The first time I went on a serious run was when I was 21 years old at Stanford University. From 21 to 30, I continued the tradition and ran 10 miles every year on my birthday.": "Sterling",
  "I want to say that probably 24 hours after I told CBS that I was stepping down at my 65th birthday, I was already regretting it. And I regretted it every day since.": "Walter",
  "Interventions are really emotionally exhausting and I would never ever want to have one. In the same way, I would never want to have a surprise birthday party. That would be horrible.": "Margaret",
  "For my 10th birthday, what I wanted was Beatle boots and a Beatle wig. My parents couldn't find Beatle boots, but down at the dime store, Woolworths or someplace, they found a Beatle wig!": "Ron",
  "I think the best thing about my job is that I have my life documented, which not many people get to have. They have a photo here and there and maybe some video footage from a birthday. My kids will be able to see me growing up.": "Kirsten",
  "If there's one thing I really want for my birthday, that is for the mining company not to mine my daddy's reserve.": "Bindi",
  "It's in my stars to invent; I was born on Madame Curie's birthday. I have this need for originals, for innovation. That's why I like Charlie Parker.": "Joni",
  "When I turned 35, I thought, 'Mozart was dead at 36, so I set the bar: I'm going to start writing a book on my next birthday.' I thought historical fiction would be easiest because I was a university professor and know my way around a library, and it seemed easier to look things up than make them up.": "Diana",
  "I want a chainsaw very badly, because I think cutting down a tree would be unbelievably satisfying. I have asked for a chainsaw for my birthday, but I think I'll probably be given jewelry instead.": "Susan",
  "I had arranged a birthday party for him and my children, who are all Aquarians. Instead, we got married. I ran out of excuses. It was just us and my children.": "Diane",
  "A friend never defends a husband who gets his wife an electric skillet for her birthday.": "Erma",
  "I was only 16 when I was selected for 'Madrasapattinam.' I celebrated my 17th birthday on the set of the film. That was the first time I had travelled to India, and it was a rollercoaster ride. I soon fell in love with the country.": "Amy",
  "I remember, for my fifth birthday, Chet Baker sat me on the upright piano, and he played just for me for a few minutes. I can still remember the pressure of the air on my chest. It was my first physical contact with sound.": "Jean-Michel",

  "I'm a summer baby, so I usually have my birthday as a good summer memory.": "Sloane",
  "The Queen of Crafts herself, Martha Stewart, and I have the same birthday. I prefer to think it's the glue-gun wielding, perfect-tart-producing Martha and not the copper pan-throwing, jail-going Martha. But I suppose if I am going to share a calendar square with some of Martha, I have to share it with all of Martha.": "Sloane",
  "I was put on a pony as a kid at some birthday party when you're all led around.": "Victoria",
  "I can remember the three restaurant experiences of my childhood. All I wanted to do on my birthday was to go to the Automat in New York... but I don't know if you consider that a real restaurant.": "Alice",
  "I guess I could say I'm an actor, which I am, but that sounds like I'm putting down being a movie star, which, let's face it, is what I've become to many people. For myself, I'm a guy who was very insecure from about age 14 until the day I hit my 30th birthday.": "Dennis",
  "Having a birthday around the holidays was never easy and, with every successive year, it felt more and more as if celebrating my birthday got thrown into the December holiday mix as an afterthought.": "Chelsea",
  "I'm a very keen baker; I pride myself on my cakes. I go along the classic sponge line, but I like to jazz it up: I've made some psychedelic birthday cakes.": "Greg",
  "My second play, The Birthday Party, I wrote in 1958 - or 1957. It was totally destroyed by the critics of the day, who called it an absolute load of rubbish.": "Harold",
  "I used to go to musicals every birthday - that was my birthday present. We'd go to London, me and my two brothers and mum and dad. I think I saw 'Mamma Mia' about five times.": "Lily",
  "In the winter of 2012, as my fiftieth birthday approached, I began to write what turned into my autobiography, a look at my own life through the lens of food.": "Kate",
  "My 50th birthday approaching felt like a big milestone to me. I've lived half a century. If I write about food and use my life as a fulcrum to move the story along, maybe I've lived long enough to fashion a narrative that has a happy ending.": "Kate",
  "Less than two weeks before my 34th birthday, I bought pots. Most people were amazed that I did not previously own pots, but that was before I explained that I had never used my oven, and used my stovetop for my dishrack.": "Rachel",
  "If you catch me lying, it's probably because I'm about to surprise someone for their birthday, or hide away the specific details about a company getaway to a strange but amazing place.": "Ryan",
  "I used to be good with kids, but as I get older, I'm grumpy and terrible with them. As for doing a gig at a 6-year old's birthday party, you couldn't pay me enough.": "Johnny",
  "I don't go to celebrity parties a lot. I don't really enjoy them because I really like going for it in parties. And sometimes at celebrity parties, there is no dancing on tables because people... it can be a little judgmental at times. So I tend not to go unless it is Taylor Swift's birthday party; then it's amazing.": "Sam",
  "I once choked on a chip at a friend's birthday when I was seven and had to be sent home, as I'd broken my collarbone coughing.": "Stella",
  "I wore a $30 vintage wedding dress for my 8th birthday in an underground jazz club in Seattle. This was what I wanted.": "Dove",
  "I was on the train; I did play, but I also played in bars, in the streets, at birthday parties for people who discovered me on the train.": "Benjamin",
  "I was standing right behind Marilyn, completely invisible, when she sang 'Happy birthday, Mr. President.' And indeed, the corny thing happened: Her dress split for my benefit, and there was Marilyn, and yes, indeed, she didn't wear any underwear.": "Mike",
  "I threw my son, Brandon, a rave for his birthday and I fully set it up like a crazy rave with lights and sound, me and my partner DJ'd - I got Mix Master Mike from the Beastie Boys to come DJ for a bit.": "Tommy",
  "Nick Swardson used to have birthday paint parties. They were phenomenal.": "Craig",
  "My first proper kiss was from Cara Shucksmith when I was 13 or 14 at her birthday party.": "Robert",
  "Even when I was an engineer, I was a comic on my job. At birthday and holiday parties, I was the one scheduling and emceeing. If you work on your gift, and you're good, it will shine through.": "Loni",
  "Every year before a big competition, I get hurt doing stuff I should not be doing. One year it was my little brother's 12th birthday. We all played hide-and-seek late at night. I climbed up a 30-foot tree, thinking he'd never catch me. I tripped and fell on one of the branches and I hit my head.": "Ryan",
  "I had the worst birthday party ever when I was a child because my parents hired a pony to give rides. And these ponies are never in good health. But this one dropped dead. It just wasn't much fun after that. One kid would sit on him and the rest of us would drag him around.": "Rita",
  "Anybody can have a birthday. It requires nothing. Murderers have birthdays. It's the opposite of anything that I believe in. And I don't like at work where you stop everything to sing 'Happy Birthday' to someone. I feel like that's for children.": "Mindy",
  "Robert Duvall saw me playing at a restaurant in Louisiana and invited me to be an extra in his movie 'The Apostle.' He gave me a guitar for my sixth birthday, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.": "Hunter",
  "The thrill of performing - that's something that hasn't changed for me. That simultaneous joy of creating something and sharing it with an audience - it's the same now as it was then, when it was just my cousins' birthday party.": "Steve",
  "For Tim Burton's birthday I gave him a rainbow beetle. He loved it!": "Eva",
  "I think my first album was a gift for my birthday and a Faith Hill album I loved her. ": "Sara",
  "I don't know what that is because to me, Feb. 14 is Rob Thomas' birthday, and that's only what I acknowledge it as. I just like to celebrate that as Rob Thomas' birthday.": "Nikki",
  "Jesus' birthday is commercialized, so of course, Black History Month is commercialized.": "Jidenna",
  "Does Martin Luther King really want his birthday commercialized?": "Jidenna",
  "We were probably the last people in the country to get a VCR and we didn't have cable. There wasn't any admiration of glamour, no, 'I want to look like them or have that lifestyle', because everyone in my town had the same lifestyle. So I didn't think, 'Ooh, a movie star's birthday!' I just thought, 'What?'": "Christina",
  "I just remember celebrating my 18th birthday at home, so that was a big party.": "Angelique",
  "On Sept. 20, 2011, a year after I spoke with Rabanni, a couple of Taliban emissaries arrived at his Kabul fortress with a gift for his 71st birthday. It turned out not to be the truce offering they had claimed they were bringing: one of the Talibs had a bomb hidden in his turban.": "Terry",
  "My biggest hero, Gregory Peck, was my birthday present on April 14, 1973. I just sat and stared at him.": "Loretta",
  "You think back and you ask yourself why you became so interested in wolves. I think it was because when I was very small, growing up in a little hamlet near Shap, we would go to Lowther Wildlife Park for birthday parties. Now closed, it was only three miles from my parents' house.": "Sarah",
  "I celebrated my 18th birthday in Japan, which was quite memorable; I was quite fascinated by the different traditions and the culture; it was so completely different to Australian culture.": "Miranda",
  "If you are an actress in L.A., on your 40th birthday they should just hand you the keys to the lunatic asylum.": "Romola",
  "Every year on my birthday, I start a new playlist titled after my current age so I can keep track of my favorite songs of the year as a sort of musical diary because I am a teenage girl.": "Chris",
  "The first guitar I ever got was for my 13th birthday.": "Rick",
  "As I approached my 18th birthday and prepared to enter military service in World War II, I was recommended to receive the Melchizedek Priesthood.": "Thomas",
  "I grew up doing all that stuff because I was obsessed with the '50s. I had sock hops for birthday parties. So I've always done The Twist and stuff. It was pretty natural and, with my parents doing it all the time, I'd just copy them. Not very pretty.": "Brittany",
  "I had been offered a Hollywood contract before my 18th birthday. It gave me the spark I needed.": "Gene",
  "Sinatra invited me once to his birthday party in L.A. I was young, and I felt great about it. But when I got there, the Rat Pack were all in the kitchen laughing their heads off.": "Tony",
  "I lived for 15 years in Los Angeles, and I still can't believe that the handsomest man in the world, Cary Grant, and the greatest performer in the world, Fred Astaire, and Johnny Carson, one after another - they were all in my home at different times. I celebrated my 50th birthday with them. Unforgettable.": "Tony",
  "I often imagine what it would be like if my father were still here to mark his 100th birthday, if Alzheimer's hadn't clawed away years, possibilities, hopes. What would he think of all the commemorations and celebrations?": "Patti",
  "I believe that if writers want their readers to care about a character, they have to care themselves. I have to root for a detective who screws up as much as Thorne does, who shares my birthday, my North London stomping ground, and my love of country music, both alt and cheesy.": "Mark",
  "I'm a Virgo and I'm more - I don't want to say 'negative' - but I'm the girl who thinks no one's coming to my birthday party, no one's buying my clothes, no one's reading my book, no one's watching my show - that's just how I think.": "Rachel",
  "Growing up, my birthday was always Confederate Memorial Day. It helped to create this profound sense of awareness about the Civil War and the 100 years between the Civil War and the civil rights movement and my parents' then-illegal and interracial marriage.": "Natasha",
  "All my favorite stars, my family and my friends are here. I'm having the happiest birthday that an 18-year-old girl could ever have.": "Brandy",
  "I timed my previous wife's pregnancy to the moment to have my son born on Bob Dylan's 50th birthday. There is no bigger Bob Dylan fan than me. You don't just time the day and impregnate your wife to get your kid to be born on Bob Dylan's 50th birthday.": "Charlie",
  "I just had my 30th birthday and we went turkey shooting. It's what I wanted to do, so we went.": "Kelly",
  "For my 16th birthday, my family took me to L'Auberge de L'Ill, which was family-run but had three Michelin stars. It was a revelation. After that meal, I realised this is what I want to do.": "Jean-Georges",
  "I hate birthdays. I hate birthday parties. I hate them. I don't know what it is, anybody's only got to come wafting near me with a piece of cake with a candle on and I break out in hives.": "Cat",
  "I crashed my boyfriend's birthday when I was 12 years old. He didn't invite me and so I showed up.": "Isla",
  "That's the great thing about New Year's, you get to be a year older. For me, that wasn't such a joke, because my birthday was always around this time. When I was a kid, my father used to tell me that everybody was celebrating my birthday. That's what the trees are all about.": "Alan",
  "As a kid, I always went to therapists; the first time was when my parents were separated on my sixth birthday, then on and off since then.": "Pete",
  "I saw Richard Linklater's film 'Slacker' for my twenty-first birthday. That was the moment when it all seemed possible. This guy gave me hope.": "Kevin",
  "If I go away, I take a little picture of my son. It's in a frame with a speaker, and he recorded a birthday message for me when he was nine or 10. I can't listen to it without filling up.": "Lesley",
  "I think there's something about the homemade birthday cake, because my wife, on my daughter's first birthday, started the tradition where she takes a full cake and cuts the number birthday out of it.": "Willie",
  "My mother always bought our birthday gifts.": "Bruce",
  "As I approach my 88th birthday, it's become apparent to me that my eyes and ears, among other appurtenances, aren't quite what they used to be. The prospect of long flights to wherever in search of whatever are not quite as appealing.": "Mike",
  "If I'm about to forget my kid's birthday, I want the phone to scream at me until I do something about it.": "Sundar",
  "When I was a kid, for my birthday every year, my mother made me pasta bechamel, which is rigatoni with a white cream sauce.": "Giada",
  "As a child, I always chose a false nose and some face paint and a wig for my birthday.": "Ashley",
  "You know, we'd just had a birthday, he was... you know, he still had a future out of him, and all I can is he was just one of the most beautiful people in the world... a very gifted man, and it's a loss to the world, not just for us.": "Robin",
  "I married two weeks after my 18th birthday, far too young, and by the time I was 23 I was a single mother of three small children, Sean, Daniel and Victoria, living in a prefab house.": "Sue",
  "To my surprise, my 70s are nicer than my 60s and my 60s than my 50s, and I wouldn't wish my teens and 20s on my enemies.": "Lionel",
  "Why, on my mother's birthday, am I thinking about 'Father Knows Best?' At our house, mother knew best at least as often as father did, but then the title of the old sitcom, a homogenized portrait of American family life, was meant to be slightly sardonic.": "Tom",
  "When I was a teenager, the actors I was really into were Mickey Rourke and Sean Penn. I saw 'Rumble Fish' on my 16th birthday, and around the same time, it was 'Falcon and the Snowman' and 'Bad Boys' from Sean Penn.": "Aidan",
  "I like working on my birthday, so I always do.": "Abhishek",
  "Just before my 16th birthday, Natalie Dormer said to me, 'As soon as you turn 16, you're going to work adult hours. People will try take advantage of you, so it's important not to be a pushover.'": "Sophie",
  "Traditionally Presidents Day was Washington's birthday. It was celebrated as a public holiday on February 22 each year, in peace or in war.": "Nigel",
  "Family time was very difficult when my girls were little, but I never missed a birthday; I was there for every major event.": "Jeff",
  "I really thought to myself, 'If I'm going to do anything in this world, I am going to be the best I can be.' I have a tennis coach that has taken me as far as my body can go. I hired a private skiing coach during my birthday week. I have a private yoga instructor. I just don't understand why you wouldn't give yourself every advantage.": "Mark",
  "By the time of my ninth birthday, I had become a bit of a socialist, as I am said by conservative colleagues to be to this day. I went on within the next few years to volunteer as an envelope stuffer for the American Labor Party, and my political thinking has not shifted measurably since that time.": "Sherwin",
  "I get uncomfortable when people give me presents and watch me open them. I don't have birthday parties, because the idea of a group of people singing and looking at me while I'm blowing out candles gives me hives.": "Brit",
  "I was fired at the pinnacle of my career, on my 39th birthday. And in the year that followed, I learned that there are many psychological phases of being 'let go.'": "Mika",
  "The day before my 16th birthday I got my guitar.": "Stevie",
  "My birthday is a day when all I want is to bask in the love of my family and rarely accept offers for concerts and shows if they are to be held on this day.": "Kailash",
  "My mom and my father's birthday are on the same day.": "Victor",
  "With my daughter, we do arts and crafts, we read a lot, we listen to music, and we cut the strings off balloons and bounce them around after birthday parties.": "Lisa",
  "My mom won't let me buy high-fashion stuff unless it's TK Maxx or a birthday occasion.": "Chloe",
  "I told my father I wanted to play the banjo, and so he saved the money and got ready to give me a banjo for my next birthday, and between that time and my birthday, I lost interest in the banjo and was playing guitar.": "Jackson",
  "As far as those kinds of things, I also played at the concert to call for the release of Nelson Mandela when he was a political prisoner in South Africa. We were celebrating his 70th birthday and calling for his release.": "Jackson",
  "I filed a brief as a friend of the court in the U. of Michigan to keep affirmative action at the U. of Michigan, which I attended the law school. And I was one of the original sponsors of making the Martin Luther King birthday a federal holiday.": "Dick",
  "I've always wanted to buy a sports car. After the England series, I went up to my dad and said that I wanted to buy a sports car and got his consent. On his birthday, I surprised him by bringing it home. It's a Porsche Boxter Limited Edition, and my family was thrilled to see it.": "Suresh",
  "I was very aware of Jeff Buckley. My brother actually bought me The Mamas And The Papas and Jeff Buckley for my birthday when I was in my early teens.": "Imogen",
  "For my 11th birthday, I asked to be adopted.": "Kaui",
  "I don't go into a fight mad. I go into a fight like it's my birthday. I love what I'm doing.": "Paige",
  "The sexiest thing my girlfriend has ever done for me is when she planned three full days of events, meals, and surprises for my birthday. It was like one continuous gift.": "Chris",
  "More and more, there are things in my life that I find hard to say. Like, 'David Bowie and Lorde were at my birthday party.' She's a phenomenal spirit.": "Tilda",
  "One thing that was really dope for me was that my dad had a '78 Corvette, '78 or '76 Corvette all my life. It always needed to be fixed up. I remember it's just been sitting in the driveway for years, and I got it fixed from top to bottom for his birthday.": "Sevyn",
  "For my birthday my husband learned to cook and is cooking one day a week for me. But he only likes to do fancy dishes. So we end up with weird, obscure things in the refrigerator.": "Cheryl",
  "The Governors Ball is like a big birthday party, and all these stars are like excited kids running around - 'Oooo, look at my pretty new dress!' And what's the best, most fun surprise at a birthday party? When the cake comes out!": "Sherry",
  "I went by Kyle, and I made friends on the team as Kyle. It went on for a pretty long time, until I went to a birthday party in a dress and all the hockey players were like... 'Kyle?'": "Katie",
  "All I watch is the Food Network. I took a cheesemaking class a few weeks ago, and I told my family and friends to only get me kitchen stuff on my birthday. I'm into every kind of cookbook and anything by Anthony Bourdain. I'd love to own a restaurant if I could find the right chef.": "Jesse",
  "I've raced on all seven continents at least twice. I've probably run thousands of races. But the single race that I'm most proud is a 10K. Yes, a 10K. I ran it with my daughter on her 10th birthday.": "Dean",
  "When you're an expert in a subject, you can retain new factoids on your favorite topic easily. This only works for the subjects you're truly passionate about, though. Baseball fans can reel off stats for their favorite players, then space out on their own birthday.": "Clive",
  "I wanted Cathy and Irving to actually say 'I do' and be pronounced husband and wife on Feb. 5, which is my mom's birthday.": "Cathy",
  "I always wanted to shave. It is a very natural process. For my birthday I got a lot of shaving stuff.": "Chaz",
  "I was quite a shy child. I would get terribly nervous and throw up before my birthday party. And then I would be fine. I feel the same now. I get nervous, then it's fine.": "Matthew",
  "Having studied at the Sorbonne, I spent my 21st birthday in Paris and celebrated with one of my professors in a cafe outside of Notre Dame.": "Joseph",
  "I don't like my birthday. I don't like things that are directed towards me. It took me a long time to get over people asking me to write my name in the book.": "Matthew",
  "I'm not big on dark chocolate, but I do have a sweet tooth, so it gets me in trouble. I love warm chocolate chip cookies with ice cream. Then there's this chocolate pie my mom makes for me every year for my birthday. She's been making it since I was younger, and there's nothing like it. It's really so, so good!": "Phillip",
  "On my birthday, I was in Milan for the collections.": "Eva",
  "I must have been yearning for some Jewish content beyond my genetic makeup because soon after my 21st birthday, I noticed I was no longer dating WASPs.": "Susan",
  "A 1920s dress I wore on my 21st birthday... literally disintegrated on me. I had the most wild debauched night. And that disintegrated dress sits in my closet - such a great memory.": "Liz",
  "I find the violence in PG13 movies unbearable. This kid will never run home, never have another birthday. His death is slow, nightmarish. And you have to explore the consequences - the people who live on with this death.": "Marlon",
  "Every five years, I like to do a big birthday party. I had my 45th birthday with 75 friends in Marrakesh, Morocco.": "Chip",
  "If I could be doing anything, I'd be laying on the floor in my birthday suit eating junk food and watching something dumb on TV.": "Anita",
  "I jumped out of an airplane on my 34th birthday because I promised myself I would. I have an interest in confronting my fears.": "Michael",
  "Funny story: I was hanging out with Adam Shankman for Samantha Ronson's birthday, and Lance Bass was there. I don't really know Lance, but he comes over to me and goes, 'Hey, I just wanted to let you know I'm a fan of 'Pretty Little Liars' and I'm rooting for your character.' It was surreal! That's how 'PLL' has changed my life.": "Ryan",
  "The summer before my third year of law school, I worked at a law firm in Washington, D.C. I turned 25 that July, and on my birthday, my father happened to be playing in a local jazz club called Pigfoot and invited me to join him. I hadn't spent a birthday with him since I was 3, but I agreed.": "Deval",
  "The first glimpse I had of what Mario Batali's friends had described to me as the 'myth of Mario' was on a cold Saturday night in January 2002, when I invited him to a birthday dinner.": "Bill",
  "I thought it would be cool to Skype with fans on their birthday and spend, like, a half-hour with them. I did a couple of two-hour Skypes. I just hang out with them and play songs and stuff. At first they're kind of shy, but after a while they open up. I've had a lot of people tell me I'm doing something no one has ever done before.": "Austin",
  "My dad bought me a dartboard for my 11th birthday, and I became intrigued by the game.": "Eric",
  "They decided as part of my 75th birthday celebrations that I would be entitled to fly first class. I'll be honest, I'm not good at flying anymore. To my credit, I can stretch out on two coach seats.": "Chuck",
  "The main prank that we play with props is for people's birthdays. The special effects people will put a little explosive in the cake so it blows up in their face - that's always fun to play on a guest star, or one of the trainees or someone who's new.": "Catherine",
  "And for the city's birthday, we will host events in every neighborhood of the city, inviting all of our residents to share in the celebration of Boston's great epic - the story of neighbors who support one another where it matters most.": "Thomas",
  "Friends and family do not believe you write fiction. They truly believe that every word you write is either autobiographical or based on them. I once had a character say that she never wanted to be invited to another children's birthday party, and I never received another children's birthday party invitation ever again.": "Liane",
  "Given the importance of Washington, outsiders probably have an unrealistic perspective on how large the city is. The fact is, Washington D.C. is a small town, and most everyone knows most everyone else. That person of the other party who you despise will someday be at your daughter's birthday party.": "Kevin",
  "I suddenly realized how much I loved her when we attended Alfred Hitchcock's 75th birthday party last August. There was something magical about that night, and it made me see how much she really meant to me.": "Rod",
  "Nobody is going to pretend that I am younger than I am. Apart from anything else, it is in the papers all the damn time - every time I have a birthday.": "Laurence",
  "I play PC and Xbox games at home, and I just got a PSP as a birthday present.": "Uwe",
  "Well, I started conducting kind of by accident. I wanted to give myself a special birthday present for my fortieth birthday, and I was living in San Francisco at the time and I started attending some of the concerts and then simply dropping hints.": "Bobby",
  "Like many women my age, I am 28 years old.": "Mary",
  "I'm good in summer. My birthday is in summer. I don't like it when it's too hot, but, you know, blue skies, I think people genuinely loosen up a bit, and it's nicer.": "George",
  "My mom FedExes a red velvet cake she makes from scratch to me every birthday.": "Molly",
  "I remember for my 18th birthday, I was going to get a tattoo, and I made the mistake of thinking I was a man and telling my father, and he was like, 'Oh yeah? You better tattoo a new address on your arm, because you're not living here!' And that was the end of that discussion.": "Adam",
  "One I built when I was a kid, and it was a real miniature of Disneyland. I fell in love with the park when I went there with my parents on my 12th birthday.": "Bobby",
  "I went to a rare live Van Dyke show and met him there. And then he came to a show of mine and we spoke back stage. The third time was at Brian Wilson's birthday party.": "Matthew",
  "The summer of 2002 at the Wilson birthday party I met Van Dyke again and I made plans to have dinner with him.": "Matthew",
  "My father was one of the fortunate wartime servicemen: he made a full recovery from his injuries, was promoted to captain, survived the war, had a satisfying career as a colonial officer and, eventually, died in February 2002, a month before his 85th birthday.": "Michael",
  "I cried on my 18th birthday. I thought 17 was such a nice age. You're young enough to get away with things, but you're old enough, too.": "Liv",
  "When I was little I thought, isn't it nice that everybody celebrates on my birthday? Because it's July 4th.": "Gloria",
  "I'm amazed. When I was 40, I thought I'd never make 50. And at 50 I thought the frosting on the cake would be 60. At 60, I was still going strong and enjoying everything.": "Gloria",
  "I had a birthday one night on a farm we were shooting on. I walked into the tent, and there were 150 people waiting for me, all wearing masks of my face.": "Stephen",
  "Every night, I was read to. Every Friday, we were taken to the library. I always received at least one book for my birthday. I have a few of them yet. Early on, I had my own collection of books. I loved to read. Still do.": "Avi",
  "May it be long before the people of the United States shall cease to take a deep and pervading interest in the Fourth of July, as the birthday of our national life, or the event which then occurred shall be subordinated to any other of our national history.": "Samuel",
  "Seven years into writing a novel, I started to lose my mind. My thirty-seventh birthday had just come and gone, the end of 2008 was approaching, and I was constantly aware of how little I had managed to accomplish.": "Akhil",
  "Jewellery's not a big thing for me. The only thing I wear is a gold cross on a chain that I got for my 21st birthday. You have to take it off every day for filming, but that's the only time I'm not wearing it. You won't find me in rings, bracelets or earrings.": "Jonas",
  "In college, I wrote newspaper articles and songs. Then, on my 21st birthday, I sold my first book. It was a nonfiction book about women pirates - 'Pirates in Petticoats.' After that, I was a book writer for good.": "Jane",
  "I did a cake for the 60th birthday of Elton John, for Britney Spears' 27th birthday and for the 'Circus' album she put out - the cake had circus themes. I prepared a cake for a surprise 82nd birthday event for the architect Frank Gehry; the cake was comprised of mini-replicas of his buildings.": "Ron",
  "If every year is a marble, how many marbles do you have left? How many sunrises, how many opportunities to rise to the full stature of your being?": "Joy",
  "I like to give people novels I think they would like, on no particular occasion - just when we're in a bookstore together. I like to receive reference books on my birthday.": "Daniel",
  "There weren't any astronauts until I was about 10. Yuri Gagarin went into space right around my 10th birthday.": "John",
  "The more Mommy blogs going nuclear over playground etiquette I read and birthday parties of glazed adults munching cupcakes like demoralized zombies I attend, I realize this is what my friends who conceived before me meant by, 'You just won't care.'": "Emma",
  "My mother still sends a cake to the office for my birthday.": "David",
  "On a royal birthday every house must fly a flag, or the owner would be dragged to a police station and be fined twenty-five rubles.": "Mary",
  "I lost twins at 14 weeks, and I had to have an D and C on my birthday.": "Amy",
  "Even when I was a kid, I had a good thing with kids. To this day, if I go to a birthday party with one of my kids, I swear to you, I am so much happier hanging out with my kids and their friends than talking to the grown-ups.": "Shawn",
  "If you've been running a business for 38 years, you're approaching your 66th birthday, you've never owed a man a penny or done anyone any grievance in your life, and you feel hard done-by and try to protect yourself and your family, but go to prison, well if that's the society we're living in, I'm happy to accept that.": "Sean",
  "The only show my mother could afford to take me to when I was growing up was 'Cats', for my birthday.": "Tammy",
  "On my 14th birthday, my grandfather and my grandmother gave me the best birthday present ever: a drafting table that I have worked on ever since.": "Jarrett",
  "I'm an avid shoe fan. I got my first pair of Louboutins as a birthday gift from Jami Gertz.": "Toks",
  "For my 50th birthday, I got ahold of a new print of 'Saturday Night Fever.' I see it much more as a tough coming-of-age movie than as a disco story.": "Gene",
  "I met Leonardo DiCaprio and Busta Rhymes the same night, on my birthday in New York.": "Jason",
  "This is a wonderful way to celebrate an 80th birthday... I wanted to be 65 again, but they wouldn't let me - Homeland Security.": "Art",
  "For my 23rd birthday, I received a nylon string guitar. I told myself that if I could play Eric Clapton's 'Tears In Heaven,' then I could play the guitar. I practised every chance I got, driving my housemates insane, until several weeks later I had a shaky version of the song down. I wrote my first song on the guitar a few weeks after that.": "Neil",
  "My brother got a .22 for his 12th birthday I got a .22. He got a hunting knife I got a hunting knife. ": "Stephanie",
  "I've died so many times. I'm 65. On my 40th birthday, my girlfriend gave me a reel with ways I had died, whether it was by knife, or electrocution or drowning or being thrown off a building or whatever it might have been. I've died a lot of times!": "Jonathan",
  "'Down on Me' can't showcase my true talent. 'Birthday Sex' was robotic. When I perform it, I can't give you this church feeling I know I can give.": "Jeremih",
  "Yes, I grew up with guns. For my 16th birthday, in fact, I received a .357 instead of a car. But there was nothing playful about them; they were tools. My parents went through a back-to-the-land phase. Most of our vegetables and fruits came from our own garden.": "Benjamin",
  "Most of us can remember a time when a birthday - especially if it was one's own - brightened the world as if a second sun has risen.": "Robert",
  "My father was a legendary copywriter. He wrote 'Timex Takes a Licking and Keeps on Ticking.' He named Earth Day 'Earth Day.' It falls on his birthday, April 22. Earth Day, birthday. So the idea came easily.": "Sarah",
  "I was fired by 'America's Next Top Model' on my birthday.": "Paulina",
  "I have a strong memory of the day I was told that my father had a weak heart and that he had to go to the hospital. He died when I was nine years old on the same day that Franklin Roosevelt died it was his 45th birthday. ": "Alan",
  "I dated a guy for over a year who lied about his age the entire time. I found out after the fact and couldn't believe it! I even threw him a birthday party for the wrong age... I couldn't get over how hard he had tried to keep it a secret!": "Kirsten",
  "By the time I was seven, I did a sonnet at Shakespeare's Globe theatre for Shakespeare's birthday because my dad had been at the first season of the Globe and was friends with the artistic director. Somehow, that lead to me doing a sonnet!": "Alfred",
  "With a recent birthday, I've been acting now for twenty years.": "Thayer",
  "I have friends who hide in their bedroom for three days every time they have another birthday. That's what brings the wrinkles! I didn't care when I turned 30 or 40 or 50.": "Maria",
  "Birthday Alarm was a very simple site based on being reminded of your friends' birthdays.": "Michael",
  "Most artists don't get paid for what they do, and they are lucky if they can persuade a friend to let them show something at a kid's birthday party.": "Andrei",
  "I used to go down every year for the remembrance of Elvis' birthday. Memphis State College invited me to sit in the auditorium and speak to the people for one of those Elvis days.": "Otis",
  "Lucy took care of me on the set, and made sure that none of the crew cussed around me. She also had birthday parties for me and made sure that they were well attended.": "Keith",
  "When I was young and it was someone's birthday, I didn't have the money to buy nice presents so I would take my mom's camera and make a movie parody for whoever's birthday it was. When I'd show it them, they'd die laughing. That reaction was a high for me, and I loved that feeling.": "David",
  "My 21st birthday was awesome. I was in L.A., and it was great. I had a bunch of friends that came out. The night ended up in a completely different direction than we thought it was going to go.": "Jonathan",
  "It is really a great feeling to win a World Cup on your birthday.": "Nino",
  "I grew up in Queens, and part of my birthday gift, always, was a Saturday matinee of whatever hit musical there was. When I was three, I saw 'Oliver!'.": "Lonny",
  "Mattresses! Beautiful! Let's go buy a couple of mattresses. Give 'em to people for their birthday.": "Lawrence",
  "I never got a chocolate birthday cake; I got a carob one. And when I went to other kids' houses, I was very covetous of things like Cheez Whiz that I'd find in their refrigerators.": "Amanda",
  "I had sort of had a 21st birthday when I was 17, 18 years old living in Japan. I had all of that stuff sort of happen earlier for me, which happens to a lot of people. My 21st birthday was just a little boring. Not a great story.": "Sarah",
  "My mother asked me what I wanted for my birthday, so I said I wanted to read poetry with her.": "Guy",
  "I get letters constantly from all over the world, telephone calls from America, Brazil, Australia, all over, especially on my birthday. A family? I have a huge international family. That's all I need.": "Renata",
  "I think I've wanted to be an actress since the day I was born. I even asked my parents for an agent for my seventh birthday!": "Shoshannah",
  "I have an extensive library - every birthday when I was a kid my parents would ask what movie or book I wanted, so I have built up a big collection over the years.": "Mark",
  "I actually had the pleasure of meeting David Bowie at his 50th birthday party in New York City. I handed him the cassette of 'Eight Arms to Hold You,' which I had just got an advance of that day. He very graciously thanked me and tucked it into his jacket pocket.": "Louise",
  "I do like to shock and surprise people. When it's all in good fun, of course.": "Ruth",
  "If you want a happy ending, that depends, of course, on where you stop your story.": "Orson",
  "Movies can and do have tremendous influence in shaping young lives in the realm of entertainment towards the ideals and objectives of normal adulthood.": "Walt",
  "Pick up a camera. Shoot something. No matter how small, no matter how cheesy, no matter whether your friends and your sister star in it. Put your name on it as director. Now you're a director. Everything after that you're just negotiating your budget and your fee.": "James",
  "A wide screen just makes a bad film twice as bad.": "Samuel",
  "The most honest form of filmmaking is to make a film for yourself.": "Peter",
  "When people ask me if I went to film school I tell them, 'no, I went to films.'": "Quentin",
  "Cinema is a matter of what's in the frame and what's out.": "Martin",
  "My dream role would probably be a psycho killer, because the whole thing I love about movies is that you get to do things you could never do in real life, and that would be my way of vicariously experiencing being a psycho killer. Also, it's incredibly romantic.": "Christina",
  "Life is more than sunglasses and hit movies. Reality - that's the main event.": "Sylvester",
  "Filmmaking is a completely imperfect art form that takes years and, over those years, the movie tells you what it is. Mistakes happen, accidents happen and true great films are the results of those mistakes and the decisions that those directors make during those moments.": "Jason",
  "Cinema is the most beautiful fraud in the world.": "Jean-Luc",
  "I secretly enjoy being alone - hiking alone, skiing alone, walking along the beach alone, going to movies alone. Do not get me wrong, I like sharing my life with other people, but sometimes I really enjoy being as alone as possible.": "Josh",
  "Cinema should make you forget you are sitting in a theater.": "Roman",
  "One of the reasons I love devils so much is not based in my faith, but because as a kid, I grew up loving heavy metal and horror movies, and the devil is such a huge presence in both.": "Victor",
  "Always make the audience suffer as much as possible.": "Alfred",
  "The elements that create glamour are not specific styles - bias-cut gowns or lacquered furniture - but more general qualities: grace, mystery, transcendence. To the right audience, Halle Berry is more glamorous commanding the elements as Storm in the X-Men movies than she is walking the red carpet in a designer gown.": "Virginia",
  "People sometimes say the way things happen in the movies is unreal, but actually, it's the way things happen to you in life that's unreal.": "Andy",
  "My siblings and I, we were raised on TV and films. Not a day went by that we weren't watching one of three movies - 'Caddyshack,' 'Animal House,' 'Beverly Hills Cop' - on rotation. Our comedy, our personalities were set watching 'Sesame Street': these really sort of wacky, Jim Henson-y characters.": "Teddy",
  "I grew up when I was 15 when I had my first opportunity in movies. I watched every great movie for a year and a half, and since then I've asked myself how I can emulate such artistry. That's really my motivation. I want to do something as good as my heroes have done.": "Leonardo",
  "A story should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order.": "Jean-Luc",
  "Cancer taught me to stop saving things for a special occasion. Every day is special. You don't have to get cancer to start living life to the fullest. My post-cancer philosophy? No wasted time. No ugly clothes. No boring movies.": "Regina",
  "For so many people, television and movies may be the only way they understand people who aren't like them.": "Michelle",
  "I really love scary movies, so I'm all about Halloween.": "Normani",
  "I always wish the hotels were like they are in movies and TV shows, where if you're in Paris, right outside your window is the Eiffel Tower. In Egypt, the pyramids are right there. In the movies, every hotel has a monument right outside your window. My hotel rooms overlook the garbage dumpster in the back alley.": "Gilbert",
  "Some of my foster families used to send me to the movies to get me out of the house and there I'd sit all day and way into the night. Up in front, there with the screen so big, a little kid all alone, and I loved it. I loved anything that moved up there and I didn't miss anything that happened and there was no popcorn either.": "Marilyn",
  "I love scary movies. I like blood and gore, and I love Halloween movies.": "Carrie",
  "Whenever I have free time, I love to just lay in my bed and watch YouTube videos, watch movies. Just basically do nothing.": "Bethany",
  "A cinema villain essentially needs a moustache so he can twiddle with it gleefully as he cooks up his next nasty plan.": "Mel",
  "You know what your problem is, it's that you haven't seen enough movies - all of life's riddles are answered in the movies.": "Steve",
  "Being sad and being depressed are two different things. Also, people going through depression don't look so, while someone sad will look sad. The most common reaction is, 'How can you be depressed? You have everything going for you. You are the supposed number one heroine and have a plush home, car, movies... What else do you want?'": "Deepika",
  "Film spectators are quiet vampires.": "Jim",
  "I don't want to dress up a picture with just my face.": "Grace",
  "I was striving to be the most muscular man, and it got me into the movies. It got me everything that I have.": "Arnold",
  "Technology continues to bring us wondrous advances in filmmaking to improve how we view movies.": "Ridley",
  "We all need illusions. That's why we love movies.": "Monica",
  "Some people go to the movies to be reminded that everything's okay. I don't make those kinds of movies.": "David",
  "I've never had a movie that got great reviews. I've had movies that got different levels of good and bad reviews, but you can more or less count on plenty of bad reviews.": "Wes",
  "I wanted to do another movie that could make us laugh and cry and feel good about the world. I wanted to do something else that could make us smile. This is a time when we need to smile more and Hollywood movies are supposed to do that for people in difficult times.": "Steven",
  "I have loved movies as the number one thing in my life so long that I can't ever remember a time when I didn't.": "Quentin",
  "There's no master plan; I'm just going with what I'm inspired to do and what I get asked to do, and luckily the things I've been the most passionate about, I've gotten to do. And a lot of times I've gone up for movies that I didn't really care that much about, and I never got that.": "Nat",
  "My motto: 'No good movie is depressing. All bad movies are depressing.'": "Roger",
  "It may be true that the only reason the comic book industry now exists is for this purpose, to create characters for movies, board games and other types of merchandise.": "Alan",
  "I'm literally driving in the middle of the night, and my phone rings, and my manager says, 'How would you like to be the host of the Daily Show?' I get out the car, and I didn't have legs. You know in those movies where there's an explosion? But instead of the sound of the explosion, you hear the silence. That's literally what happened.": "Trevor",
  "I think there's a character one has if you're a chief executive officer. Movies would suggest you're a bad person - if you're wealthy, if you've done well, oh, you must be bad. And frankly, winning the lottery doesn't change who you are; you're the same person inside. And I'm the same person I was as an 18-year-old who fell in love with Ann.": "Mitt",
  "I've always been a movie guy, movies have been my thing. I love movies, all kinds of movies.": "Christopher",
  "Like Hollywood movies, MTV and blue jeans, fast food has become one of America's major cultural exports.": "Eric",
  "I'm a crier. I always cry. I cry at the dumbest things, too. This is why I sort of steer clear of movies and films that I know are going to be depressing. I don't care how many awards they've won - I know they're good. I don't need to watch them, because I don't want to be depressed, and I don't want to cry.": "Yvonne",
  "The 'serial kisser' tag that has been thrust on to me is a lame stereotype. It irritates me. Yes, there is sexual content in my movies, and I have never been apologetic about doing bold scenes. But it's not fair to tag me this way because that can be very stifling.": "Emraan",
  "I guess I can't live without Netflix because I would have nothing to do. All I do is sit home and watch movies.": "Sara",
  "Horror movies are all about getting your attention you always have to be on guard. People love to be on the edge - there's nothing like a surprise. ": "P.",
  "When I was a boy, I always saw myself as a hero in comic books and in movies. I grew up believing this dream.": "Elvis",
  "I just grew up watching a lot of movies. I'm attracted to this genre and that genre, this type of story, and that type of story. As I watch movies I make some version of it in my head that isn't quite what I'm seeing - taking the things I like and mixing them with stuff I've never seen before.": "Quentin",
  "I don't like business talkers, you know, people who are constantly like, 'Blah blah blah movies.' I find it incredibly boring.": "Zooey",
  "I play a little guitar, write a few tunes, make a few movies, but none of that's really me. The real me is something else.": "George",
  "Television and movies were our biggest teachers. When we came to the United States, the Vietnam War was just ratcheting up. And so the Asian faces that I saw on the news, they were the face of the enemy. Asian men, particularly, were either small, ineffective, or they were evil. And those messages were deeply, deeply embedded in me for many years.": "Alex",
  "When I was a kid, I really loved watching 'Cinderella.' It's a fantasy, and every girl knows that real life isn't always like these movies, but as a child, I just really loved the story of 'Cinderella.' I found it to be so romantic and just a beautiful movie to watch.": "Sara",
  "Movies are a big part of our Indian culture.": "Mahendra",
  "It's not like since I make comics I only read comics and since I make movies I will only go out and watch movies. Any kind of artistic expression interests me; it goes from literature to music to sculpture, painting; whatever is extremely inspiring for me becomes a reference also for me.": "Marjane",
  "I made my living in comedy, but I'm not a silly person. I've got all these sides to me. Even in my movies that I've written myself, the characters sometimes border on great anger or nutsiness or other kinds of behavior. I'm not just doing fart jokes for two hours.": "Albert",
  "A good film is when the price of the dinner, the theatre admission and the babysitter were worth it.": "Alfred",
  "It's the movies that have really been running things in America ever since they were invented. They show you what to do, how to do it, when to do it, how to feel about it, and how to look how you feel about it.": "Andy",
  "I don't take the movies seriously, and anyone who does is in for a headache.": "Bette",
  "Everything makes me nervous - except making films.": "Elizabeth",
  "To grasp the full significance of life is the actor's duty to interpret it his problem and to express it his dedication. ": "James",
  "Make them laugh, make them cry, and hack to laughter. What do people go to the theatre for? An emotional exercise. I am a servant of the people. I have never forgotten that.": "Mary",
  "I do believe that movies are subject to a million interpretations.": "Oliver",
  "A filmmaker has almost the same freedom as a novelist has when he buys himself some paper.": "Stanley",
  "I never thought I'd land in pictures with a face like mine.": "Audrey",
  "If the boy and girl walk off into the sunset hand-in-hand in the last scene, it adds 10 million to the box office.": "George",
  "The sound and music are 50% of the entertainment in a movie.": "George",
  "I was going to go to a four-year college and be an anthropologist or to an art school and be an illustrator when a friend convinced me to learn photography at the University of Southern California. Little did I know it was a school that taught you how to make movies! It had never occurred to me that I'd ever have any interest in filmmaking.": "George",
  "When I was growing up, Dr. Seuss was really my favorite. There was something about the lyrical nature and the simplicity of his work that really hit me.": "Tim",
  "I learned what I really love is making films, not the film business. I want to be on the set, meeting with writers, I want that freedom. I love it now.": "Harvey",
  "People know that I have a great love for cinema. Not just for commercial cinema, but for the 'cinema d'auteur.' But to me, two of the great 'auteurs' are actually actors and they both happen to be French. One is Alain Delon and the other is Jean-Paul Belmondo.": "Harvey",
  "Editing is where movies are made or broken. Many a film has been saved and many a film has been ruined in the editing room.": "Joe",
  "Jesus is a half-naked guy, hanging, nailed to a cross, and then people wear that around their neck, and then those are the people that are upset about violence in movies.": "Marilyn",
  "The whole world loves American movies, blue jeans, jazz and rock and roll. It is probably a better way to get to know our country than by what politicians or airline commercials represent.": "Billy",
  "Movies can't ruin books. They can only ruin movies.": "S.",
  "Movies don't make people act a fool. People act a fool because they want to act a fool.": "Eazy-E",
  "I'm terrified of the supernatural things, which is why I'm very grateful that I don't see things like that. Because if I did see things of the paranormal persuasion, I don't think I'd be able to continue making scary movies.": "James",
  "If you just love movies enough, you can make a good one.": "Quentin",
  "All my friends were in college when I was making 'Superbad.' We were drinking beer and watching movies and eating pizza. It wasn't like I was going to nice restaurants or anything like that, and I lived like a frat guy. Eventually it was time to grow up, be healthy and be responsible. You can't live like a kid forever, you know?": "Jonah",
  "My favorite movies are the ones that are different the second time, or where you're constantly discovering new things. It's not just genre movies, either, and it's not just about twists. I saw 'Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy' four times in the theater before I realized it's a love story. I love that.": "Drew",
  "When I finished the trilogy of 'Pirates of the Caribbean' movies, I had a gear shift and thought, 'I need to take a moment to smell the roses.'": "Orlando",
  "In cartoons, in movies, time passes differently. There are flashbacks and flashfowards.": "Warren",
  "The studios gotta start making more stuff where black folks get quality stuff. But I can't trip about that because I've been making movies for 35 years, and I've played everything from an old lady to a donkey, so I can't be on here talking about, 'They don't give us enough roles' and diversity.": "Eddie",
  "I manage to hide in my movies.": "Liev",
  "I was the only swimmer in movies. Tarzan was long gone, and he couldn't have done them anyway; he could never have gotten into my bathing suit.": "Esther",
  "The thing about the UK is we don't really make that many great movies.": "Jason",
  "I'm terrible at horror movies, by the way. I get scared so easily.": "Oliver",
  "By going to the movies, and because of other things, too, going to college, making a wide variety of friends, moving around traveling, I became a lot more open-minded than the heritage I was born into might have suggested.": "Roger",
  "More and more major businesses and industries are being run on software and delivered as online services - from movies to agriculture to national defense.": "Marc",
  "Hollywood is throwing action movies at me.": "Liam",
  "You know, I put my little brother in the movies and he's still in the pictures. My mother makes me put him in the pictures.": "Sam",
  "Even today, in our progressive times, in most movies that come out, the men have to have biceps and the women have to be thin or something.": "Joseph",
  "Why be boring? Have some fun. Rock shows should be like movies: I don't go to a movie hoping it'll change my life.": "Alice",
  "In movies we tend make things black and white: you're either this, or you're that.": "Bill",
  "I'm a weird big guy. Doing rapping, doing movies. Do a lot of stuff. But always do things the right way.": "Shaquille",
  "I always try to describe making movies like summer camp, or some holiday where you spend all day, every day with a new group of people whom you kind of love and then never see again.": "Eddie",
  "The first two movies I directed failed, when I was 21 and 23, and that was the greatest thing that could have happened.": "M.",
  "I like to think of myself as a fairly educated human being, but I'm a very uneducated actor when it comes to movies, directors, producers, actors for that matter.": "Shailene",
  "I used to look at horror movies as being really real and it would totally freak me out and give me nightmares. Now I watch and think, 'whoa how'd they do that?'": "Evan",
  "In Chinese culture, it wouldn't occur to kids to question or talk back to their parents. In American culture, kids in books, TV shows and movies constantly score points with their snappy back talk. Typically, it's the parents who need to be taught a life lesson - by their children.": "Amy",
  "I have a maple leaf tattoo over my heart, quite literally, and my two favorite things on Earth are being in Canada and making movies.": "Jay",
  "You have to realize I like doing big movies that appear on a big screen. So the visuals and the audio have to be of a certain quality before I start to get excited about the thing.": "Hans",
  "I came to Southbury because I wanted to live a more simple life. When I was a child, I saw lots of movies about happy people living in Connecticut. And ever since then, that was where I wanted to live. I thought it would be like the movies. And it really is. It's exactly what I hoped it would be.": "Polly",
  "I like Ryan Gosling as an actor. I watch all of his movies, and he's Canadian and I just like his swag. I read his interviews and I'm a big fan of his.": "Drake",
  "I go to movies, go out with friends, go to car shows. I have a zoo.": "Axl",
  "My father loved 'Godard and Truffaut.' He was more artsy. My mom loved the 'Bourne' trilogy she likes big blockbusters. She loved that I did 'I Am Legend.' My passion for acting came with my passion for movies. ": "Alice",
  "Unless you're a big movie star, regular television work is going to bring you more exposure than anything. Everybody has a television; not everybody goes to the movies.": "G.",
  "Hopefully, after 'Victorious' has lived a long and beautiful life, I would like to go into movies. And I'd like to have a very successful movie career. Ultimately I'd love to win an Oscar; that's my big goal in life, so that's what I'm going for.": "Elizabeth",
  "'Tropic Thunder' is one of my favorite movies of all time. 'Blazing Saddles.' Anything that will get me to smile.": "John",
  "Nothing was planned in my career. I just went with the flow and took everything that came to me. Selling potato chips was obvious, as it was a family business. When friends suggested I should try theatre, I gave it a shot. Then I did a lot of advertisements, and then movies happened.": "Boman",
  "I wouldn't call myself successful, just obsessively exhausted. The music makes me smile, the movies make me feel humbled, and the comedy saves my life every day.": "Vir",
  "Some of my favorite movies are action movies. You want something good to say. That comes from good writing. But writing is not a skill I possess, unfortunately.": "Jason",
  "I was very influenced by movies I was very influenced by a world that had a sense of dream. ": "Ralph",
  "I think they should have movies in restaurants. I can't believe that so many people get together just to sit there. It's so abstract... isn't it abstract? What are these people sitting here watching?": "Andy",
  "An often-repeated assertion in the body of film criticism I have written is the assertion that movies do not just mirror the culture of any given time they also create it. ": "bell",
  "When I did 'Bird,' it was a surprise to some people, first because I wasn't in it and second because most of the films I'd been doing were cop movies or westerns or adventure films, so to be doing one about Charlie Parker, who was a great influence on American music, was a great thrill for me.": "Clint",
  "I love movies. And I dig a great love story: the kind that wrecks me, then builds me back up and leaves me inspired. I write what I want to see.": "Gina",
  "I've yet to use a cellphone, and I've never tweeted or entered Facebook. I try not to go online till my day's writing is finished, and I moved from Manhattan to rural Japan in part so I could more easily survive for long stretches entirely on foot, and every trip to the movies would be an event.": "Pico",
  "In all my work, in the movies I write, the lyrics, the poetry, the prose, the essays, I am saying that we may encounter many defeats - maybe it's imperative that we encounter the defeats - but we are much stronger than we appear to be and maybe much better than we allow ourselves to be. Human beings are more alike than unalike.": "Maya",
  "I've always tried to make movies that pull the audience out of their seats... I want audiences to be transported.": "Peter",
  "We're in a world where masculinity, especially with these big spectacle movies, is often pushed by rippling six packs and forcing an image down someone's throat trying to prove masculinity. Whereas I think true masculinity comes from having a strong sense of self.": "Theo",
  "I washed dishes so I could make movies. it was never a way for me to make money.": "Casey",
  "I really hate relaxing. I've done three movies in a row, worked for two years straight, and to me, idle time is the devil's workshop. I like to focus on something.": "Leonardo",
  "I am not really into paintings, to be honest, but for me, the art I love is when I see singers putting their heart into their song, actors giving the performance of their lives, and books and movies that make me feel something I never thought I could; there's art in everything as long as it's made with soul.": "Sara",
  "The great thing for me about 'The Resurrection of Gavin Stone' is it's a throwback to the old fashioned Hollywood movie that you can watch with your family, has a message, and is funny and entertaining. They didn't call them faith-based movies; they just called them good movies.": "D.",
  "Streaming TV shows, movies, and other types of video over the Internet to all manner of devices, once a fringe habit, is now a squarely mainstream practice. Even people still paying for cable or satellite service often also have Netflix or Hulu accounts.": "Walt",
  "'Ernest Borgnine' is sort of my version of Woody Allen's 'Purple Rose Of Cairo' in that it's about the occasional difficulty of coming to terms with the cold hard facts and the temptation to escape into another world - like movies, for example. I'm a pro at escaping.": "John",
  "Our trials and our times of pain get the most recognition, but 'Straight Outta Compton' speaks to triumph. When it's doubtful, when nobody is on your side, when your back is against the wall, you triumph and make it through. Showing growth through movies promotes growth.": "O'Shea",
  "I sure lost my musical direction in Hollywood. My songs were the same conveyer belt mass production, just like most of my movies were.": "Elvis",
  "I think there's a vague sense out there that movies are becoming more and more unreal. I know I've felt it.": "Christopher",
  "It's difficult to do a genre film well, and it doesn't matter if you're talking vampire movies or 'Dawn of the Dead' or 'The Thing' or 'Escape From New York.' Those kind of movies, they understand what the old-school B-movie is supposed to be, they get the throwback of it.": "Ethan",
  "My dad had a commercial film company, so he had a videotape player before anyone. So he got Mel Brooks movies or Citizen Kane or some classic old movies. And every summer the revival house in Evanston would show the great films from the '50s and '60s and '70s.": "John",
  "When you look at movies, the lead girl is always gorgeous and thin. There is a stereotype that you need to look a certain way and when you get in the business you really feel the pressure.": "Margot",
  "Who said that being Latino is to be a stereotype? Characters are stereotypes when making plans or without shades. I do not believe in the picture or model established in the movies.": "Edgar",
  "Just to get a job is always really exciting to me. I do feel there's a lot left for me to learn about movies, the subtleties of acting.": "Sebastian",
  "There should be a point to movies. Sure, you're giving people a diversion from the cold world for a bit, but at the same time, you pass on some facts and rules and maybe a little bit of wisdom.": "George",
  "When I felt like an outsider, movies made me feel inside my own skill set.": "Steven",
  "I'm very opinionated about movie musicals when they're adapted from live shows. You'll sit still for a three-minute song in a theater. But in movies, a glance from someone's eyes will tell you the whole story in a few seconds.": "Stephen",
  "I think a great first date would be something different... not like movies or going to dinner... going rock climbing together... doing an activity and then going to dinner, so that you guys share an experience, and then you have something to talk about, and it's not the same old thing.": "Madeline",
  "Movies are written in sand: applauded today, forgotten tomorrow.": "D.",
  "In my movies, I'm not trying to erase any old image of myself, really. And also I'm not trying to imitate anyone or follow in their footsteps, because I know, Burt Reynolds was just one of the people that told me this, I know how you can only last in this business if you got something special to offer, just by being yourself.": "Mark",
  "I'm a fat kid on the inside. I love food so much, and I fluctuate about 25 to 30 pounds between movies. I feel like I have to do a chess movie that requires very little movement at some point, just so I can eat pizza and play chess on the beach all day.": "Channing",
  "People look at Marvel movies as epic in scope, but if you look back at the comics, you realise that Marvel heroes were often a reaction to the square-jawed DC characters like Superman, who were flawless and beyond reproach.": "Jon",
  "I drove from Naples to the Amalfi coast in an Alpha Romeo 1969 Spider, which was lovely. There have been lots of movies made down there, and I felt a bit like James Bond - the driving is quite hairy. The locals have mopeds, but you wouldn't catch me on a bike on those roads. A tank would be safer!": "Paul",
  "I'm not a big fan of there being voiceovers in movies. I really prefer it when the film tells it story.": "Salman",
  "Football games are on TV, and it doesn't affect stadium attendance at all. It's the same with movies. People who really love movies and like to go out on a Saturday night will go to the movie theater.": "George",
  "I've always wanted to be an actress, ever since I was a little girl. I've always played the mom and I play my sister as the daughter. I wanted to be an actress on television and movies instead of just around the house.": "Dakota",
  "It's a political and manipulative industry. Actors vie for the same roles, movies are snatched away. Have I ever been manipulated? Yes. But I haven't manipulated anyone because if you think from the heart, you cannot be calculative. I have spent nights crying.": "Kareena",
  "In the movies, you want a good story and characters that are honest, but you are also looking for a good director who can lead the ship. That's how we look at business. Everybody has a great idea for a start-up, and so do their relatives, and they tell me, 'You gotta build it.' I say, 'I have to believe in it.'": "Ashton",
  "When people say they take hits and flops in their stride, I personally feel that they are just lying. Of course, I'm upset when my movies flop. I take it very personally.": "Mahesh",
  "Music has always been a great solace for me. It's still something that gives me far more joy than movies, I must say. I love movies, too. But somehow, music can transport you. There are so many different kinds of experiences you can have with music.": "Allison",
  "When Ginger Rogers danced with Astaire, it was the only time in the movies when you looked at the man, not the woman.": "Gene",
  "I remember working on movies like Gettysburg and feeling that Jeff Daniels was kind of a mentor.": "Donal",
  "Nobody should come to the movies unless he believes in heroes.": "John",
  "My grandmother and I saw an average of eight movies a week, double features, second run.": "Carol",
  "Movies are like an expensive form of therapy for me.": "Tim",
  "Any girl who likes watching movies would like to work in them and would want to do all of that. I'm also one of them. But people know me for badminton and love me for it. So I'd stick to it right now. But maybe after badminton, I'll think about it.": "Saina",
  "Music is the only passion I shamelessly indulge in. However, for recreation I enjoy watching movies. 'Wizard of Oz' was the first film I ever saw, followed by the 'Bond' movies. I also watch a lot of World cinema through DVDs mostly brought by one of my best friends who's now based in Toronto.": "A.",
  "My grandmother and I would go see movies, and we'd come back to the apartment - we had a one-room apartment in Hollywood - and I would kind of lock myself in this little dressing room area with a cracked mirror on the door and act out what I had just seen.": "Carol",
  "Sexiness, particularly in movies, is the chess game in the 'Thomas Crown Affair'. It's, it's, I don't know, but Faye Dunaway comes up a lot in that thinking. It's the subtlety of sexiness. The moment you try to be sexy, then it's not.": "Daniel",
  "I think a big part of marriage is not going anywhere on those days you feel you really want to. It's like in the Barrier Islands. If you want to stay together, don't leave. I think just culturally - in the media, in movies, in books - we're trained to divorce when that first blush of sexual longing starts to fade. That's just where marriage starts.": "Tony",
  "If my films make one more person miserable, I'll feel I have done my job.": "Woody",
  "Critics can be harsh and I think it's going to take me a long time to make people see what I have inside of me and that I really put my guts into movies and that I'm not superficial and that I'm not just a pretty face.": "Diane",
  "The only thing I can't do is hear. I can drive, I have a life with four kids, I work on TV, I do movies, so the deafness question, is it that they want to know because, what? Not sure.": "Marlee",
  "What I don't like are pompous, pretentious movies.": "Peter",
  "It'll be the Internet and piracy that will kill film. There's a philosophy that the Internet should be free, but the reality is that piracy will destroy the film industry and film as an art form because it's expensive to make a movie. Maybe you'll have funky little independent movies, and it'll go back and then start up again some other way.": "Helen",
  "For me, horror movies are a real escape.": "Lena",
  "Men want a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue. That is what is written in their hearts. That is what little boys play at. That is what men's movies are about. You just see it. It is undeniable.": "John",
  "There's a generation of children who don't like black and white movies. There's a level of impatience or intolerance now.": "Peter",
  "100 years ago, movies were black-and-white, silent, and 16 frames a second. So 100 years from now, what are they going to be?": "Peter",
  "When we were doing 'Freaks and Geeks', I didn't quite understand how movies and TV worked, and I would improvise even if the camera wasn't on me. I thought I was helping the other actors by keeping them on their toes, but nobody appreciated it when I would trip them up. So I was improvising a little bit back then, but not in a productive way.": "James",
  "My wife comes with me on all the movies, but she is not an appendage to a film star or anything like that. She is a completely intertwined partner. She is the other half of me. Also, we're still very much in love with each other. We always have been, we always will be.": "Michael",
  "The end of a picture is always an end of a life.": "Sam",
  "One of the reasons why people - particularly young people - love action movies is because what they are really looking for is justice.": "Steven",
  "Like all kids who want to be in action movies, I want to jump out of a speeding car, shoot guns, slide out the side in slow motion like a John Woo movie.": "Dallas",
  "As a newcomer to America who learned to 'speak American' by watching movies, I firmly believe that to change the politics of immigration and citizenship, we must change culture - the way we portray undocumented people like me and our role in society.": "Jose",
  "I watch an awful lot of old Hollywood movies - I'll devour anything with Bette Davis or Joan Crawford. My absolute favourite is 'Sunset Boulevard' starring Gloria Swanson.": "Amanda",
  "I'm shockingly terrible at action movies.": "Emma",
  "I would go through phases of wanting to be a mermaid or a vet, but because I grew up around people who were always making movies, I guess it sort of just moulded my mind.": "Dakota",
  "I want to become a Hollywood film star. I genuinely would love to be in some movies.": "James",
  "It wasn't until I saw James Dean that I began to think that maybe I could actually do this. Movies didn't have to be just this fantasy with this impossibly handsome guy.": "Terence",
  "I like to look like a person. It drives me crazy when you see women in movies playing teachers, and they have biceps. It totally takes me out of the movie. I start thinking, Wow, that actress playing this part really looks great!": "Emma",
  "I never think it's right to chew gum in front of other people, but a lot of times I'll come in for a meeting chewing gum and I'll forget I'm chewing it. Then you don't want to swallow it because it stays in your system for seven years or something, so I've asked to throw it away. I've started to wonder if that's why I didn't get certain movies.": "Jennifer",
  "The first fashion show I ever attended was for Ritu Beri in 1997 or 1998. I think that was the first time Ritu had designed for one of my movies 'Yeh Raastein Hain Pyaar Ke.' She had done a show in Paris, and she had done the same show in Delhi. It was very eclectic, and I love the way she combines colours and makes them flamboyant.": "Madhuri",
  "I love horror, I love scary movies, I love thrillers. If things creep you out and spook you? I love it.": "Lana",
  "The next thing I knew, I was out of the service and making movies again. My first picture was called, GI Blues. I thought I was still in the army.": "Elvis",
  "A lot of movies are about life, mine are like a slice of cake.": "Alfred",
  "I love the movies, and when I go to see a movie that's been made from one of my books, I know that it isn't going to be exactly like my novel because a lot of other people have interpreted it. But I also know it has an idea that I'll like because that idea occurred to me, and I spent a year, or a year and a half of my life working on it.": "Stephen",
  "I love indie movies. I think that independent cinema is where it's at and where a lot of trends begin. It's where new filmmakers are breaking through.": "Zooey",
  "America had, for one thing, lived in anarchy for - until much more recently than Europe. We had the Wild West, where the cliche of the cowboy movies was the nearest sheriff is 90 miles away, and so you had to pack a gun and defend yourself.": "Steven",
  "Even in India the Hindi film industry might be the best known but there are movies made in other regional languages in India, be it Tamil or Bengali. Those experiences too are different from the ones in Bombay.": "Aishwarya",
  "There are some movies I can watch over and over, never get sick of. I'll put one of those on and be puttering around the house. Then a certain scene will come on and I'll just have to go over and watch.": "David",
  "I do love the films I've done in the past. I work hard in my movies and my friends work hard and we're trying to make people laugh and I'm very proud of that.": "Adam",
  "We need more extreme movies in Sweden. Personal projects that are necessarily made for a bigger audience. I think it creates a creative lock-up to have the audience as a goal.": "Noomi",
  "There's more to life than movies.": "Paul",
  "All movies aren't fun some are hard work. You try to do something and convey a set of emotions that have to do with some real life kind of stuff. ": "Samuel",
  "All through my life what I've loved doing is watching movies. I love the escapism of film, I love stories. So it is incredible to be able to be in them as much as I am, to see them from the first stitch in a costume to the end product.": "Keira",
  "Well, the thing about great fictional characters from literature, and the reason that they're constantly turned into characters in movies, is that they completely speak to what makes people human.": "Keira",
  "It's time for me to do things I like so I will be happy, my wife will be happy, my friends will be happy. I just want to do something I'm proud of. It's time for me to change. I could sign with a company for 10 movies and I'm the king of video and so what?": "Jean-Claude",
  "I don't want to criticize any other designers, but I have to say that many of the people involved in this industry - directors and producers - are trying to make their games more like movies. They are longing to make movies rather than making videogames.": "Shigeru",
  "There's too much down time making movies. That leads to boredom. And that leads to trouble.": "Jeremy",
  "I never really got nightmares from movies. In fact, I recall my father saying when I was three years old that I would be scared, but I never was.": "Tim",
  "Man's inhumanity to man is as old as humanity itself. Some people just do evil things. Most do not. A billion people have seen 'Batman' movies over the past 20 years, and they have been entertained and inspired. One man saw it as a sick entry point for mass murder. The one is tragic. The billion are not. I choose to write for the billion.": "Kurt",
  "My friends tell me I'm the most boring celebrity they know! A typical night for me is at home in California or watching movies in my pyjamas.": "Amber",
  "In most movies there is a Prince Charming who rides up and saves the girl.": "Zoe",
  "'Sunset Boulevard' - the story of Hollywood movies draped on a depressing sex affair - is an uncompromising study of American decadence displaying a sad, worn, methodical beauty few films have had since the late twenties.": "Manny",
  "I guess you get pigeon-holed in Hollywood, but I'm ok with that because I've been able to do a lot. I started in the theater, then I went to stand-up comedy, and then when I went into the movies to do comedy and drama and big movies and small movies.": "Denis",
  "I wish there would be more movies about scientists.": "James",
  "Ideally I'd like to be working steadily as an actor: movies, a TV series, that sort of thing. I've been through a few different TV development cycles, and they didn't work out. When the time and project are right, it'll come together. Like I tell a lot of guys, it's not a race; there's no finish line.": "Russell",
  "I did four movies where I gained, like, fifty pounds. I had curly hair, and I had all of this facial hair. I had put on all this weight for these movies, and I did four or five of them back-to-back. Then I cut the weight and I got fit again. I cut my beard and I took away the mustache, and people were like, 'What are you doing?'": "A.",
  "Whether as victim, demon, or hero, the industrial worker of the past century filled the public imagination in books, movies, news stories, and even popular songs, putting a grimy human face on capitalism while dramatizing the social changes and conflicts it brought.": "George",
  "My folks always let me go to the movies every Saturday. We were really motion-picture goers.": "John",
  "I make movies in order to make things understood, not to be shocking.": "Bernardo",
  "I love to star in movies, but I want to have good roles. It doesn't help to get starring roles in something that's no good. I mean, that will just kill you.": "Joe",
  "I do like going to the movies, but I like eating tons of sweets and ice cream, so I can't go to the movies anymore.": "Tyson",
  "Books are up against TV and movies and video games and a multimedia society that is so busy that people don't have contemplative time any more. I worry deeply about this. In fact, I worry about everything all the time. I used to be a punk. All I wanted to do was tear everything down, and that was so much easier.": "T.",
  "I guess I've been extremely keen on theatre, on getting on to the stage, taking on different roles, enacting vocations, personalities, people, situations, and I guess that's the interest that has driven me to work in movies.": "Amitabh",
  "I traveled to Morocco once, and I only saw one television when I was there, but I did go into this dirt cave and I saw this kid chopping tomatoes and pita, and he had a picture on the wall of Jean-Claude Van Damme holding a gun. That connected with him on the other side of the world, so no wonder these big movies are made - they have a mass appeal.": "Parker",
  "I really detest movies like 'Indecent Proposal' and 'Pretty Woman' because they send a message to women that sleeping with a rich man is the ultimate goal and really that's such a small part of it.": "Laura",
  "Summer movies are spectacles that's what you pay 10 dollars to see. You want to get teased by effects sometimes. I think that will never stop. ": "Jan",
  "A lot of my stories are inspired by Japanese folklore or literature or movies: I've done stories based on Kabuki and Noh plays, and on Kurosawa's 'Yojimbo' movies.": "Stan",
  "A film is a petrified fountain of thought.": "Jean",
  "Citizen Kane is perhaps the one American talking picture that seems as fresh now as the day it opened. It may seem even fresher.": "Pauline",
  "I'm not a film buff. I don't watch a lot of movies.": "Denzel",
  "From what I've been able to determine, many of our big stars are addicted to tobacco. They want to smoke in movies for the same reason I smoked as I wrote, which is that they think their performance is going to be better.": "Joe",
  "The one benefit of having done all kinds of movies as an actor is, you learn the pros and cons of being tempted to do a really big movie because it costs a lot of money.": "Ben",
  "My favorite thing about movies is the ending, and so all my favorite movies have really great endings.": "Emma",
  "Old film-noir movies. There's something comforting about watching black-and-white movies, and hearing this kind of music just puts me in a fantasy world. It's a really great escape for me.": "Petra",
  "If making movies was easier, there'd be a lot more good movies. So you kind of learn that if it's just a good script, or if it's just a good producer, that's not always enough. You need an entire team of creative people coming together.": "Chris",
  "I have a love interest in every one of my films: a gun.": "Arnold",
  "I don't think you should feel about a film. You should feel about a woman, not a movie. You can't kiss a movie.": "Jean-Luc",
  "There's an electrical thing about movies.": "Oliver",
  "Give me a couple of years, and I'll make that actress an overnight success.": "Samuel",
  "If my films don't show a profit, I know I'm doing something right.": "Woody",
  "I think a sequel is a waste of money and time. I think movies should illuminate new stories.": "Francis",
  "So much of movie acting is in the lighting. And in loving your characters. I try to know them, and with that intimacy comes love. And now, I love Voldemort.": "Ralph",
  "I was obsessed with romance. When I was in high school, I saw 'Doctor Zhivago' every day from the day it opened until the day it left the theater.": "John",
  "And in movies you must be a gambler. To produce films is to gamble.": "Douglas",
  "I don't storyboard. I guess it dates back to my days in live television, where there was no possibility of storyboarding and everything was shot right on the spot - on the air, as we say - at the moment we were transmitting. I prefer to be open to what the actors do, how they interact to the given situation.": "Arthur",
  "I'm definitely a romantic comedy dude because I'm a big romantic at heart. I'm a softy, so it's always nice to watch movies that make you think that love at first sight is actually possible.": "Sterling",
  "I do think it's getting better, but I have noticed that Asians are not well represented in awards shows, and not a ton of Asian faces on the big screen either. Perhaps some of the young Asian actors who are on TV series now will be seen in upcoming movies in the near future - Jamie Chung, Constance Wu, Suzy Nakamura, to name a few. Fingers crossed.": "Lauren",
  "I've made so many movies playing a hooker that they don't pay me in the regular way anymore. They leave it on the dresser.": "Shirley",
  "I never wanted to do the same kind of movies over and over anyway, so my theory on it all is I'm just gonna try and dodge the label and keep doing what I am doing.": "Matt",
  "Well, I think one of the main things that you have to think about when acting in the movies is to try not to make the acting show.": "James",
  "Sex is a doorway to something so powerful and mystical, but movies usually depict it in a completely flat way.": "David",
  "I think most people, even if they say they hate horror movies, there's that feeling you get inside that you love. I mean, I love it. I love to have the hairs on the back of my neck stand up or get that chill up my spine.": "Barry",
  "Horror movies can be very interesting because they can deal with intangible subjects that are full of emotion.": "Meg",
  "It was like in Samoa when they'd put up a movie screen on the beach and show movies and the locals would run behind the sheet to see where the people went. It was pretty grim.": "Dick",
  "I love to unwind and watch movies, especially those from the classic black-and-white era.": "Fred",
  "I don't think London has been given enough credit in a lot of the movies that we make here.": "Mel",
  "I like boxing movies. One of the hardest things for me to watch as far as boxing films, is the boxing. The actual boxing usually sucks.": "Omar",
  "I like simple things. I like to sneak in the theatre and watch movies. I'm a movie buff.": "Justin",
  "I don't want to imitate life in movies; I want to represent it. And in that representation, you use the colors you feel, and sometimes they are fake colors. But always it's to show one emotion.": "Pedro",
  "The movies that are made more thoughtfully or made or with more ambition often get just get drowned out by the noise.": "Roger",
  "I praise CBS for taking a risk, which is always the price you pay for opportunity. This is not standard movie of the week storytelling. I think movies of the week have fallen into a niche and that isn't my niche.": "Tom",
  "January is the garbage can of movies in America, directly after all the Oscar contenders have been out.": "Michael",
  "When videotape came so a lot of movies that I do have a kind of afterlife in video. Things where movies that I do would come and go they still come and go but you can go rent them and see them on TV. ": "Christopher",
  "I think the audience would like to see movies that are stunning to watch. I really think they'd like to see spectacles.": "Jan",
  "Usually when you see females in movies, they feel like they have these metallic structures around them, they are caged in by male energy.": "Bjork",
  "Not everybody goes to movies to get their life changed.": "Samuel",
  "You take somebody that cries their goddam eyes out over phoney stuff in the movies, and nine times out of ten they're mean bastards at heart.": "J.",
  "I'm fighting the label of 'Black' actress simply because it's very limiting in people's eyes, especially people who are making movies.": "Whoopi",
  "How many actors have a shot at being a part of something that became a part of pop culture? It's been very rewarding. I'm not getting the 20 million bucks for the new movies, but at least I'm getting warmth and recognition from people wherever I go.": "Adam",
  "People need to start to think about the messages that they send in the movies.": "Morgan",
  "I'm an actor. And I guess I've done so many movies I've achieved some high visibility. But a star? I guess I still think of myself as kind of a worker ant.": "Forest",
  "You can make movies for a select audience, but you have to market it to them.": "David",
  "I couldn't be happier about being a part of 'Hunger Games' and to play Katniss. I have a huge responsibility to the fans of this incredible book and I don't take it lightly. I will give everything I have to these movies and to this role to make it worthy of Suzanne Collins' masterpiece.": "Jennifer",
  "I thought 'The Artist' was a perfect way to find a good balance. The artistic challenge is obvious because the film is black-and-white and its silent, but I did my best to make the movie accessible and easy to watch. I really don't want to make elitist movies. I really try hard to work for the audience. Audiences are smart. They get everything.": "Michel",
  "I watched a lot of Douglas Fairbanks movies. He always played the same role with a mustache. Zorro had a mustache. The Musketeer had a mustache. Tarzan had a mustache.": "Jean",
  "Our brand at Netflix is really focused on movies and TV shows.": "Reed",
  "I think real life reflects your movies. In your life, you pick stuff that influences what movie roles you wanna pick. I think if you've got an interesting life, you wanna do interesting movies about interesting things.": "Chris",
  "Making people laugh is giving, and it's healing, too, when people can go up to the movies and forget about their problems. It's a good thing. That's why I want to work.": "Chris",
  "I have a feeling, one of those gut feelings, that I'll make pretty good movies the rest of my life.": "Paul",
  "I do like escapism. I like going to the movies on a Friday night and seeing something fun.": "Charlie",
  "I want to make movies about my country from my point of view.": "Tommy",
  "As a kid, I said, 'I want to write for movies.' When I finally had that opportunity it was like I was able to exhale. 'Wow, I'm finally doing this for real.'": "Cliff",
  "I want to do movies that I'm proud of where my kids, at some point, can see and I can feel comfortable sitting there watching it with them. And just that move people. That make people feel a little bit better about themselves when they leave the theatre.": "Kevin",
  "It's a funny thing: You want so badly for people to see what you do - you're proud of it - and I like the effect that movies have on people. But the attention can also make me uncomfortable.": "Kristen",
  "I have done many movies that people hadn't seen. 'The Fountain,' I spent a year on that. 'The Prestige' with Chris Nolan, and 'Australia.' From my perspective it's very satisfying. Some movies people see and other movies they don't. 'Wolverine,' 'X Men,' I know that in some level people know me just for that and it's fine for me.": "Hugh",
  "The things I see now on TV and in movies are so outlandish. Kids doing rude things with pies! And the language that they use! It's being outrageous for the sake of being outrageous. I can't watch it. It turns me off.": "Sid",
  "Music in movies is all about dissonance and consonance, tension and release.": "Quincy",
  "You're basically the sum of all the experiences you've ever had, and they're sort of shaken up in you and reproduced in the things you create, and that includes seeing movies.": "Ben",
  "I like movies where you can come back and re-watch them and admire the cinematography 25 years later.": "Rob",
  "Whenever I think about movies, I always look at that art process as having the best of a lot of worlds. Because if you watch a great film, you have a musical element to it, not just on the scoring, but in the way that the shots are edited - that has music and rhythm and time.": "Frank",
  "My children have never watched any of my films. Charlie knows that daddy makes movies, but he says they are not good enough for him to watch.": "Russell",
  "The way Hollywood portrays mothers - you're either all good and saint-like, or you're all bad. And I think the real honesty of motherhood is not given a voice in movies. I miss that as an audience member.": "Ellen",
  "Listen, I think movies serve many different purposes, from those movies that are frivolous and just an entertainment, to movies that just go to exploring the complexities of the human soul. Everything is valid if it's done with honesty and dignity, and I actually do both of those types of movies in my career.": "Antonio",
  "I don't stop. It's my nature. People have to tell me to slow down. I plan on playing every role on Broadway. I want to do 'Evita.' I want to do 'Sweeney Todd' with Chris Colfer. We want to do 'Wicked.' I'll be Elphaba and he wants to play 'Guy-linda.' I want to do movies, make music. 'Glee' is only the beginning.": "Lea",
  "I'd love to act more. I've had to turn down multiple movies because I was on tour, but it's encouraging to know that someday there might be the right role, the right timing. And I've been writing a lot of music, so hopefully very soon I'll have recorded a project of my own. I also want to get a boat and open a restaurant.": "Joe",
  "I hate movies that tell people what to think. I'm proud that Democrats thought 'Thank You For Smoking' was their film and Republicans thought it was theirs. I'm proud that pro-choice people thought 'Juno' was their film and pro-life people thought it was theirs.": "Jason",
  "For me, modern technology has ruined romance and movies - nobody can run to the airplane gate anymore.": "Lorene",
  "I hate to say it, but there seems to have been some sort of dumbing down as far as movies go.": "Sam",
  "In movies and in television the robots are always evil. I guess I am not into the whole brooding cyberpunk dystopia thing.": "Daniel",
  "I think it's dynamite, the way my career has just kept moving, even when people didn't know it did. I made such interesting films, but, yeah, they're not necessarily the big movies that go to the supermarket. I don't need those movies, because I don't wanna do them.": "Rutger",
  "I don't like gratuitous violence. I don't like the 'Saw' movies. I don't like the 'Hostel' movies. I don't like anything that is violence for violence's sake.": "Michael",
  "I have a trophy case that contains all the action figures ever made of me. It also has items I've stolen from my movies, like three guns and holsters from 'Serenity'.": "Nathan",
  "When I do stand-up for a long time, I'll get burned out, then I'll get an acting gig. For me, the grass is always greener. I'd like to do a mixture of all of it. My goal is just to do small movies that I've written. That's what I'm trying to do now, just write smaller movies.": "Zach",
  "I love watching old movies, reading and having some good meals. I have a very close group of friends and family. I try to spend time with the ones that I love and work as hard as possible.": "Justin",
  "Everyone loves the seventies because that's when movies were character-based, and you saw great characters and you saw very interesting filmmaking. There are interesting movies being made now, but it's harder and harder to make them.": "Justin",
  "I'm really visually stimulated more than anything. I don't really listen to music. I'm more into watching telly or watching movies and visual art.": "Sia",
  "In the 1950s, we had all these B-grade science-fiction movies. The point was to scare the public and get them to buy popcorn. No attempt was made to create movies that were somewhat inherent to the truth.": "Michio",
  "I adore watching movies movie marathons are my favorite pastime. I can watch up to five movies back to back. I also love music and like reading whenever I get the time. ": "Priyanka",
  "I've never understood the cult of Hitchcock. Particularly the late American movies... Egotism and laziness. And they're all lit like television shows.": "Orson",
  "I don't care about movies. I tend to play badminton once a week.": "Edward",
  "I'm a comedian who got into movies, so I don't really think of myself as an actor.": "Eddie",
  "I think the movie business is in trouble. It's all movies that you've seen before. Everything's a remake they want things that are familiar rather than things that surprise you. ": "Graydon",
  "I love card games, and I've always loved board games and stuff like that as a kid, and I think it's that part of your brain that's engaged in con movies. It's like this 'Who's outsmarting whom?'": "John",
  "In the past, I had a knee-jerk approach to work, and it showed on screen. I was doing movies for the wrong reasons - trying to juggle dates, do too many guest appearances, take up projects under pressure or for emotional reasons.": "Salman",
  "I don't miss acting. I don't even see movies. I don't see plays. I don't watch television.": "Charles",
  "I grew up watching old black and white movies where Marlene Dietrich or Jean Harlow would go walking down some cobblestone street in ripped stockings and head into some smoky boite and sing for a pathetic living. That's so what I wanted to be.": "Ellen",
  "The difference between movies and TV is that in TV you have to have a trauma every week, but that event may not be the biggest event in the characters' lives.": "Peter",
  "On television and in the movies, crimes are always solved. Nothing is left uncertain. By the end, the viewer knows whodunit. In real life, on the other hand, many murders remain unsolved, and even some that are 'solved' to the satisfaction of the police and prosecutors lack sufficient evidence to result in a conviction.": "Alan",
  "My background is in largely in theatre and acting. I grew up in a town with a well-respected Shakespeare Festival, and I fell in with some kids whose parents worked there. We staged all-kid versions of 'Hamlet', 'Cymbeline', a few others. All the while, I was making short films; monster movies, slapstick comedies, claymation.": "Matt",
  "I am a giant proponent of giant screens. But I accept the fact that most of my movies are going to be seen on phones.": "George",
  "I think that if you go about making movies to win Oscars, you're really going about it the wrong way.": "Nicolas",
  "During the off-season, I go to the movies almost every day.": "Derek",
  "Movies are open doors, and at every door, I change character and life... I live for the present always. I accept this risk. I don't deny the past, but it's a page to turn.": "Juliette",
  "I'm a huge Woody Allen fan. Good movie, bad movie, it doesn't matter - I just like his movies.": "Sean",
  "People say, 'Gee, you do a lot of mafia movies.' I think I've done two, out of 60.": "James",
  "I'm such a fan girl when it comes to movies, TV and sci-fi, sometimes I can't believe I actually get to be in them.": "Rebecca",
  "I can't get through some movies without shedding a tear I can't lie. ": "David",
  "I'm definitely interested in doing movies. I've always focused more on acting than singing because that's where my true passion lies.": "Melissa",
  "I think people are sick of trends changing every six months - not because we're tired of them, but just for the sake of change. There is so much junk in the world: junk TV, junk movies, all those junk magazines with the same people on the cover.": "Tom",
  "I've wanted recognition I wanted success I wanted appreciation I love the perks of being in the movies. I love the fame that comes with it - but that's why I became an actor. ": "Vidya",
  "I believe in my privacy. I always have, and I always will. I don't think that my private life needs to be on display for me to get a better response at the box office or for me to get a better choice of movies.": "Kajol",
  "'The Blair Witch Project' is great for motion sickness. The first time you see it, it is extremely creepy. The first time I saw it, I saw it on a bootleg tape on a tour bus before it had even come out. It was one of the first movies I'd seen like that. I didn't even realize it was a damn movie!": "Corey",
  "I don't want to be in somebody else's movie, and then they make all the money. I've gotten offers to do the movies, but I won't sell myself short and be in somebody else's movie, like 'Boyz N the Hood.' I don't think I woulda done that.": "Eazy-E",
  "'Close Encounters of the Third Kind.' Big, big, big smash for me. My birth of the love of cinema was born with 'Close Encounters' and '2001.' Those sci-fi movies I saw when I was a little kid.": "Denis",
  "It was always a dream as I was growing up. I would watch movies, mostly American movies, and be so engrossed in those stories, all I wanted to do was be there. I wanted to be part of that romance or that fantasy or be that warrior or that struggling soul who finally makes it good.": "Gerard",
  "A few years after 'Melrose Place,' when the luster of 'Melrose Place' wore off and what was left was just the stink, and I was just doing bad TV movies, that was a personal low point. I felt I needed to stop doing those, and I did.": "Grant",
  "Most of us cluster somewhere in the middle of most statistical distributions. But there are lots of bell curves, and pretty much everyone is on a tail of at least one of them. We may collect strange memorabilia or read esoteric books, hold unusual religious beliefs or wear odd-sized shoes, suffer rare diseases or enjoy obscure movies.": "Virginia",
  "I feel that in horror movies, especially, if you don't care about the characters, you've lost the audience. No one cares, and it becomes a process of watching people get killed.": "Drew",
  "When you go to watch a baseball game, when you go to watch an NBA game, when you watch an NFL game, when you go to watch movies, the offering that those arenas are doing foodwise is 'all the hot dogs you can eat'; all the French fries you can eat; for $20 you can eat 20 hot dogs.": "Jose",
  "I graduated from public high school. I went to the prom. I did it all. But I also worked on 30-million dollar movies with roller coasters and Michelle Pfeiffer. It's been a very interesting and blessed life for sure.": "Ryan",
  "I guess rebelliousness has been explored in many movies, but what about the smart kids' rebellion? Not just the motorcycle jackets and that kind of rebellion; it's the dorky kid - what could he do?": "Portia",
  "The reason I was in most of the movies I've done is that they paid for me to be in the theater.": "Nathan",
  "The entertainment world, television, movies, social media, YouTube stuff, we're so bombarded with so much imagery and such a great sense of inhumanity, and there is a coarseness, a coarsening of interaction.": "Steven",
  "One of my favorite movies is 'A Guide to Recognizing Your Saints.'": "Liam",
  "I'm a single parent, and I just found that it was too difficult to manage raising my kids and doing the traveling involved in making movies. So I took a little bit of a break. And the little bit of a break turned into a longer break, and then I found that I really didn't miss it.": "Rick",
  "Technology will need to make many more huge leaps before one can ever view films with the level of picture and sound quality many film lovers demand without having to slide a disc into a player, especially with the technical requirements of today's 3D movies.": "Ridley",
  "I don't envy the job of people who have to watch five movies a day - that's insane.": "James",
  "I've always been discreet - more than discreet. When a friend calls, and I'm doing something innocuous like cooking dinner, I tell them I'm reading or running out to the movies. It's the surveillance I can't stand.": "Joshua",
  "The idea that somebody would go to my YouTube channel and want to watch movies and then be subjected to some terrible car commercial - I don't like that.": "Casey",
  "I like happy endings in movies. I think life has a happy ending. When it's all said and done, it's all something worthwhile, and I want my movies to reflect that. There are enough things to be sad about. When you pop in a movie, let the message be one that's one of hope.": "Jon",
  "Music is still part of my life, but I hate the idea of people coming to see me play the guitar because they've seen me in movies. You want people who are listening to be only interested in the music.": "Johnny",
  "When I'm off the golf course, and my wife and I have free time, which is not very often, we really enjoy movies. I'm a movie nut; she might even be more so. Holiday in our house is the Oscars.": "Zach",
  "I've always seen movies in English with Spanish subtitles. For audiences around the world, the language is less important than if it's a good film.": "Patricia",
  "Jimmy Stewart lived for movies, fought for his country, and died for love. Now isn't that a wonderful life?": "Richard",
  "When I'm doing a movie, I'm not doing anything else. It's all about the movie. I don't have a wife. I don't have a kid. Nothing can get in my way... I've made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies.": "Quentin",
  "None of my costume designers have ever been nominated for an Oscar 'cause I don't do period movies that have ball scenes with a hundred extras in them.": "Quentin",
  "My movies are painfully personal, but I'm never trying to let you know how personal they are. It's my job to make it be personal, and also to disguise that so only I or the people who know me know how personal it is. 'Kill Bill' is a very personal movie.": "Quentin",
  "I took a break from horror I made three ghost movies back-to-back-to-back. ": "James",
  "One of the first movies my dad took me to see was the original 'Road Warrior.' And I was kind of raised on the action movies of that era: 'The Terminator' and 'Die Hard' and, of course, all of the 'Star Wars' movies.": "Aisha",
  "I have had quite an interesting life. My husband was quite successful in the movies, and we went out frequently with Gloria Swanson and other stars.": "Rose",
  "I was such a big 'Dirty Dozen,' 'Where Eagles Dare,' 'A Bridge Too Far' - all those kinds of movies I loved.": "Duncan",
  "Books are a little better movies than just screenplays because there's more fat on the bone. There's more character development. There's more stuff to pick from.": "Mike",
  "I thought I'd just do a wave of movies, and then I'd burn out. They just kept coming together.": "Paul",
  "We're only on the earth for a short period of time. Movies aren't enough. I want to take my success and parlay it into something bigger and better.": "Paul",
  "My photography is mainly focused on my work making movies, which I've done my whole life. I think I have a perspective that not many people have. And I get to take advantage of all of the strange sources of light on a set.": "Jeff",
  "I don't want to be knocked out. But the contact and the focus and the energy I get from sparring gives me energy to make movies, energy to be a dad, energy to be a friend, and, you know, makes me feel, probably, a lot younger and behave a lot younger than I am.": "Peter",
  "There's so much that goes into a film that I feel like it's a bit arrogant to say, 'Oh, I never watch my own movies.' Well, it's not just you. There's a whole host of other people. So much skill goes into it. But I would say it does take a couple times seeing it to get a level of perspective.": "Felicity",
  "I like stories that grow, that have unpredictable layers. As opposed to Hollywood movies that start out with a lot of shock and noise and peter out into an unconvincing cliche.": "Peter",
  "I love movies where you can sense that the director risked biting off more than they can chew.": "Damien",
  "'The Third Man,' directed by Carol Reed and written by Graham Greene, is, quite simply, one of the finest movies ever made.": "Elvis",
  "The pleasantly crude 'Hall Pass' reminds us of what's been missing from movies: Those squirm-inducing moments in comedy that produce enough discomfort that, at points, what we're watching is half a heartbeat away from a horror film.": "Elvis",
  "My parents used to do these little film festivals in our house where we'd watch all the Marx Brothers movies, or Chaplin movies, and a lot of westerns.": "Alden",
  "As anyone who has recently seen PG-13 movies knows, the level of violence in them has increased to the point of making the Motion Picture Association of America's voluntary rating system meaningless.": "Campbell",
  "I am definitely romantic, and I love romantic stories - that's why I keep making romantic movies.": "Felicity",
  "Me and Woody Harrelson, we're twins. We're the same person. I should only make movies with him.": "Laura",
  "We need to make more original movies, and audiences would do well to support original movies for the future of the medium.": "Edgar",
  "I don't like being pigeonholed at all. It stemmed from after 'Mandy Lane': I was being offered all these horror movies. I love horror movies, but when I dreamed of being a director, it was always doing all sorts of things.": "Jonathan",
  "The truth is that I didn't start out making commercial movies. My films were not film festival movies with the possible exception slightly of 'Super,' but I was able to nurture my gifts through the works of artists making lower budget films that needed a place and an outlet.": "James",
  "I wrote my first screenplay on a lark, because it was a storytelling format that felt like a familiar shorthand - we all watch movies, don't we? But even though I grew up in Los Angeles, my family was entirely unconnected with the movie industry, and I never truly believed that it would one day be my fate.": "Lisa",
  "I'm not a strikingly handsome guy, but I'm in movies.": "Shia",
  "I call 'Community' the best day job in the world, because between takes, I get to write music. I get to write sketches. I get to write movies. It's the best job ever.": "Donald",
  "I moved to California when I was twelve and I got a video camera and made little movies because I didn't have any friends yet. I would force my sister to make these movies with me - which became my YouTube channel.": "Dylan",
  "We don't make movies for critics. I've done four movies; there's millions upon millions upon millions of people who've paid to see them. Somebody likes them. My greatest joy is to sit anonymously in a dark theater and watch it with an audience, a paying audience.": "Michael",
  "I don't think movies or television have any basis in reality at all. It's all just pretend. That's what's fun about it.": "James",
  "It's simple: You get a part. You play a part. You play it well. You do your work and you go home. And what is wonderful about movies is that once they're done, they belong to the people. Once you make it, it's what they see. That's where my head is at.": "Denzel",
  "I'm a big 'Star Wars' fan and grew up watching the movies. I read all the books and have read 'Star Wars' fiction that went between the newest trilogy and the original trilogy and it was part of my childhood.": "Jared",
  "I love devastating movies, documentaries and hummingbirds (yes, in that order).": "Tig",
  "I like smart movies about smart people, and enjoy it when most of the facts are on the table and we can contemplate them together.": "Roger",
  "I hate horror movies, with a passion.": "Katee",
  "I was never that into the movies. Never. Even as a youngster. I became interested in movie music only because of the studio orchestras in Hollywood.": "John",
  "There's this little box that African-American actors have to work in, in the first place, and I was able to rise above that box. I could have done a bunch of movies where I stayed as the Axel Foley or Reggie Hammond persona. But I didn't want to be doing the same thing all the time. Every now and then, you crash and burn, but that's part of it.": "Eddie",
  "My movies are usually about stripping off the makeup, getting down to the skeleton.": "Michael",
  "I hate dream sequences in movies and T.V. shows generally for their heavy-handed symbolism and storytelling tediousness.": "Ira",
  "I think they built Hollywood on the West Coast because they were always dreaming of a New World. When they arrived here, the only way to keep dreaming was to make movies. Film was the fourth dimension.": "Denis",
  "Spider-Man has always been a huge part of my life. I love the movies. I love the comics. And I always just wanted to be Spider-Man.": "Tom",
  "So, one way or another, I found myself in a few movies. I take it seriously when I'm on the set, but I don't take myself seriously as an actor.": "Henry",
  "The thing about HD-DVD that is attractive to Microsoft is that it's very pro-consumer in letting you copy all movies up onto the hard disk.": "Bill",
  "An actress is not a machine, but they treat you like a machine. A money machine.": "Marilyn",
  "Stephen Hawking's been watching too many Hollywood movies. I think the only kind aliens in Hollywood are the ones created by Steven Spielberg - 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' and 'E.T.,' for example. All other aliens are trying to suck our brains out.": "Neil",
  "Although I'm not actually embarrassed by this, I tend not to read books that have awesome movies made from them, regardless of how well or badly the movie represented the actual written story.": "Neil",
  "I never thought, in my lifetime, that you'd be able to watch movies, read books and listen to music from a phone, but I guess the technology of tomorrow is here today.": "Dolly",
  "My favorite movies of all times is 'Doctor Zhivago,' and I love 'Gone With the Wind.' I'd love to play some Southern belle or something where I owned a plantation.": "Dolly",
  "As a writer, one of the things we all learned from the movies was a kind of compression that didn't exist before people were used to watching films. For instance, if you wanted to write a flashback in a novel, you once had to really contextualize it a lot, to set it up. Now, readers know exactly what you're doing. Close-ups, too.": "Salman",
  "In the movies, the writer is just the servant, the employee.": "Salman",
  "If you look at Indian movies, every time they wanted an exotic locale, they would have a dance number in Kashmir. Kashmir was India's fairyland. Indians went there because in a hot country you go to a cold place. People would be entranced by the sight of snow.": "Salman",
  "Whatever happened to books? Suddenly everybody's talking about these 100-hour movies called 'Breaking Bad'. People are talking about TV the same way they used to talk about novels back in the 1980s. I like to think I hang out with some pretty smart people, but all they talk about is 'Breaking Bad.'": "Douglas",
  "I'm a playwright who gets involved in movies when I'm not writing a play.": "Tom",
  "Movies can be instruments of enlightenment.": "Marianne",
  "You know those movies where the people in the audience are screaming, 'Don't go in that door!' because you know the killer is there? Well, it is the same thing with this debt. We know how this ends.": "Marco",
  "When I'm shooting a movie, I'm always in an invisible theater seat. I respect the fact that people have worked hard all week and want to go to the movies on the weekend and be entertained.": "Michael",
  "I think movies are too long.": "Michael",
  "Television has its own award. It's called the Emmy. It's a good award. I like it. I have one. But you don't see movies like 'The King's Speech' win Oscars and then go to TV and qualify for Emmys. In documentaries, some networks have been able to game the system.": "Michael",
  "Of the big horror movies of the '70s, you have 'The Omen,' 'The Sentinel,' 'Rosemary's Baby,' 'The Stepford Wives,' 'Burnt Offerings' - these are all romantic fatalist movies where there's a sort of glimmer of hope... but darkness wins.": "Chuck",
  "Movies are like magic tricks.": "Jeff",
  "So many things have to come together to get a creatively successful and financially successful film. Sometimes you'll have a movie that you're very proud of, and you think it transcended all of your expectations, but it doesn't come out at the right time. I have done movies that have never been released. That can be depressing.": "Jeff",
  "Basically, one of the hardest things about being an actor is getting your first break. I'm a product of nepotism. The doors were open to me. I'd done several movies before I decided what I wanted to do.": "Jeff",
  "Making movies is about creating illusions, and they can be subtle illusions, but it's all a cumulative effect as you make these little tweaks. It kinda adds up to something, hopefully.": "Jeff",
  "Movies become art after editing. Instead of just reproducing reality, they juxtapose images of it. That implies expression; that's art.": "Alejandro",
  "I think the whole stigma of 'black movies' is slowly being lost. When you look at movies like '12 Years A Slave,' to 'The Butler,' to 'The Best Man,' to 'Ride Along,' to even 'Think Like a Man' from last year - these movies are just good movies.": "Kevin",
  "I wish that my life could be like the movies, like 'Bonnie and Clyde' or 'The Hunger' or 'Harold and Maude.' And... it can be! It maybe just takes somebody else who is as fearless as you. It takes a person who will not hesitate.": "Marilyn",
  "Watching movies is my one distraction.": "Marilyn",
  "Maybe there are people who are gamers who haven't seen movies I have made, or the movies I have made have made no impression on them at all.": "Kevin",
  "The movies are the only business where you can go out front and applaud yourself.": "Will",
  "I'm not a real movie star. I've still got the same wife I started out with twenty-eight years ago.": "Will",
  "There's only one thing that can kill the movies, and that's education.": "Will",
  "For me, the sound design and the musical score is a big part of what makes scary movies work.": "James",
  "As a filmmaker, you aspire to want to make movies that can hopefully stand the test of time, but you never know when that will happen or if that will happen.": "James",
  "We think craft is important, and the irony has always been that horror may be disregarded by critics, but often they are the best-made movies you're going to find in terms of craft. You can't scare people if they see the seams.": "James",
  "All my movies are about people with some ideology, but guess what? It never works out.": "James",
  "I was making a lot of 8mm home movies, since I was twelve, making little dramas and comedies with the neighborhood kids.": "Steven",
  "Television has a different biorhythm than movies. I love the biorhythm of TV.": "Steven",
  "I love history, so I do a lot of movies about history.": "Steven",
  "It is not my job to compare my movies. I don't like to compare my films with other movies because I don't really have that perspective. It is an intellectual exercise, but it doesn't intuitively come to me.": "Steven",
  "A hit for me is if I enjoy the movie, if I personally enjoy the movie.": "Ridley",
  "One of the problems with science fiction, which is probably one of the reasons why I haven't done one for many, many years, is the fact that everything is used up. Every type of spacesuit is used up, every type of spacecraft is vaguely familiar, the corridors are similar, and the planets are similar.": "Ridley",
  "I always shoot my movies with score as certainly part of the dialogue. Music is dialogue. People don't think about it that way, but music is actually dialogue. And sometimes music is the final, finished, additional dialogue. Music can be one of the final characters in the film.": "Ridley",
  "When I see old movies with women in floor-length dressing gowns, or when they're going to the store and they've got a pillbox hat with a net over the eyes and white gloves, I'm offended that I can't go to the store like that.": "Blake",
  "When I first started writing for television in the seventies and eighties, the Internet didn't exist, and we didn't need to worry about foreign websites illegally distributing the latest TV shows and blockbuster movies online.": "Al",
  "A lot of action movies today seem to have scenes that just lead up to the action.": "Jason",
  "I'm the first to admit that I like going to, or my memories at least of going to Clint Eastwood movies or Charles Bronson or James Bond.": "Nicolas",
  "I try to make two movies a year. To me, that's not too much. On top of that, I like to work.": "Nicolas",
  "I do enjoy animated movies. I really love anime and movies like 'Spirited Away' and 'Howl's Moving Castle.'": "Nicolas",
  "I want to make all kinds of movies. I do want to make big movies that are a lot of fun to go to, but I also want to make movies that are going to stimulate some thought and maybe raise some awareness.": "Nicolas",
  "I may be alone in this, but I do sense the power of film, in that movies have the ability to literally change people's minds. That's pretty powerful stuff when you consider that.": "Nicolas",
  "I care about the connection with the audience. Film is such a powerful medium. Movies can change the way people think.": "Nicolas",
  "I like old movies, screwball comedies, vintage clothes, and basically I'm an old-fashioned gal.": "Zooey",
  "I think once you enter the dating world and you realise it's nothing like those Disney movies you watched when you were a little girl, you just become more guarded.": "Megan",
  "I want to turn my attention to movies about love relationships. Exploring the female psyche - there ought to be some interesting discoveries there. Love stories. If you do it right, people want to hear romantic dialog.": "Sylvester",
  "Everyone told me to pass on 'Speed' because it was a 'bus movie.'": "Sandra",
  "I always see my songs in colors, and I'm often more inspired by movies and photographs than I am by other songs when I write my music. I'm also inspired by fashion, and I want my music to be a visual painting of what's in my mind.": "Charli",
  "I think it's more interesting to see people who don't feel appropriately. I relate to that, because sometimes I don't feel anything at all for things I'm supposed to, and other times I feel too much. It's not always like it is in the movies.": "Ryan",
  "In principle, I think the idea of rewarding a good effort is interesting, but movies are generally different from each other as are performances and the conditions on how the performances are given and how they're edited and so forth.": "Viggo",
  "The thing with movies is, because you have so little time, I always feel like there are more things we could've done with the character. If we'd done a sequel to 'The Thomas Crown Affair,' what would that have been like? But for the most part, you try not to think of that, because it's just going to break your heart.": "Denis",
  "When I go to Batman movies, I always think, 'Man, I would like to be a bad guy in a Batman movie.' especially as they got darker when they go to the Christian Bale era.": "Denis",
  "You never hear of a live-action studio that has been making so-so films looking over at a studio that's making great movies and going, 'Oh, we see the difference - we're using a different camera.'": "John",
  "I love TV, and I love movies, and I pull so much content from the drama in all of those mediums and put them into songs.": "Sia",
  "If you make action movies, the critics will savage you, and then your movies are outdated the following week with the new wave of special effects.": "Adam",
  "'The Thing from Another World' was the first movie that really scared me. But the one that made me want to make movies was 'The Tales of Hoffman.' That's my favorite film of all time. It's a fantasy film. It's an opera. I never get tired of it.": "George",
  "Success begets success. I've been offered a lot of movies now that '30 Rock' has been successful.": "Alec",
  "The thing that runs through the British film industry even today is a lot of unsung movies are financially the bigger ones. Even though they weren't always the greatest of movies, something in them was very potent which people loved.": "Peter",
  "The director Sofia Coppola's new comic melodrama, 'Lost in Translation,' thoroughly and touchingly connects the dots between three standards of yearning in movies: David Lean's 'Brief Encounter,' Richard Linklater's 'Before Sunrise' and Wong Kar-wai's 'In the Mood for Love.'": "Elvis",
  "No actor has made a career of exerting determination to the extent that Matt Damon has. In the 'Bourne' movies, he burned himself down to a central nervous system - his focus fried away unnecessary calories.": "Elvis",
  "'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' is one of the greatest films of all time.": "Laura",
  "Average Americans order nonfat decaf iced vanilla lattes at Starbucks and choose from 1,500 drawer pulls at The Great Indoors. Amazon gives every town a bookstore with 2 million titles, while Netflix promises 35,000 different movies on DVD. Choice is everywhere - liberating to some, but to others, a new source of stress.": "Virginia",
  "Most of us do not consciously look at movies.": "Roger",
  "I grew up on certain movies, particular movies that said something to me as a kid from Missouri, movies that showed me places I'd yet traveled, or different cultures, or explained something, or said something in a better way than I could ever say. I wanted to find the movies like that.": "Brad",
  "Well, the wonderful thing about making movies, oddly enough, is that they're sort of highly motivated graduate studies in one or another field.": "Sydney",
  "Every single art form is involved in film, in a way.": "Sydney",
  "When you make a film you usually make a film about an idea.": "Sydney",
  "Sometimes I do movies that aren't any good, or sometimes I might not be any good in them, or sometimes they don't do very well.": "Michael",
  "I'm quite comfortable looking at myself in movies, probably because I've been doing it for so long, since I was a kid. So I sort of watched myself grow up and go through adolescence, like, basically on camera.": "Winona",
  "The woman who made those movies, that's not me. She's someone else.": "Brigitte",
  "I don't believe in the so-called Latino explosion when it comes to movies. Jennifer Lopez doesn't have an accent. She grew up in New York speaking English, not Spanish. Her success is very important because she represents a different culture, but it doesn't help me.": "Salma",
  "I love family films. Of course, as a mother who has to watch so many movies, you really appreciate it when somebody makes a film that is for everybody - family entertainment that's really for the family, where everyone has a good time.": "Salma",
  "The good thing about songwriting is you don't have to delineate between what's true and what's fiction; records aren't put on the shelf that way. Books are, movies are, but records aren't.": "Jason",
  "If I can't get the girl, at least give me more money.": "Alan",
  "I love to watch movies.": "Judy",
  "I used to be prettier than I am, but I think I look better now. I was a pretty boy. Particularly in my early movies. I don't like looking at them so much. There's a sort of pretty thing about me.": "Christopher",
  "I live making comics. Comics is an industrial art but less suffering, because comics are for young people who are more adventurous. I do that. I live off comics, and then I write books, but when you want movies, you cannot make movies without money.": "Alejandro",
  "I have a lot of repression. So repression is what I make movies about.": "Ang",
  "Making movies is a way of understanding myself and the world.": "Ang",
  "I love watching the old movies. I love Katharine Hepburn. I just adore her and everything that she stood for. I find it interesting watching the likes of Gene Tierney and those classic movies of the '40s.": "Natalie",
  "As popular culture becomes more presentist, we move away from entertainment as the vicarious experience of a narrative - as watching someone else's story - and much more toward enacting one's own story. Moving away from myths and toward fantasy role-playing games, away from movies and toward videogames.": "Douglas",
  "I'm obsessed with zombies. I like watching zombie movies and I read zombie books.": "Kevin",
  "Funny things happen to you in movies for silly reasons.": "Michael",
  "Very often I've known people who wouldn't say a word to each other, but they'd go to see movies together and experience life that way.": "Martin",
  "I think these movies are definitely comedies. It's quite difficult to take a superhero movie seriously because everything is heightened. A kid being bitten by a radioactive spider and getting superpowers is kind of ridiculous.": "Tom",
  "I remember actually going to see the first 'Avengers' with one of my best mates from home. I'd never have dreamed that I'd be in one of these movies, let alone playing Spider-Man.": "Tom",
  "Hollywood is finally waking up to the fact that people who go to church also go to the movies. I'm not sure what took them so long to see that or how long they'll keep it up.": "Tyler",
  "People feel the worst film I made was 'Jack.' But to this day, when I get checks from old movies I've made, 'Jack' is one of the biggest ones. No one knows that. If people hate the movie, they hate the movie. I just wanted to work with Robin Williams.": "Francis",
  "Movies always are open to being remade because times change so much, and the tempo of movies changes. I think of it like a James Bond. They can have different actors play the same role... I've had people come up to me and say, 'We want to remake 'The Jerk' with so and so.' And I say, 'Fine.' It just doesn't bother me. It's an honor actually.": "Steve",
  "I love being in these ensemble comedy movies. I love working with a bunch of people and coming up with, you know, How can we make this moment funnier?": "Jane",
  "There was a Russian director named Elem Klimov, who did his films during the communist days. They were constantly struggling with the authorities and to be allowed to express themselves. But he did one of the best war movies I've ever seen - it's called 'Come and See.'": "Stellan",
  "When I realized that my big dream was going to come true - 'Night Shift' was a success, 'Splash' was a success, I got the job to do 'Cocoon' - suddenly, I was underway. And I knew my name was rising up the lists. I was going to have a career. I was going to be able to direct movies until I screwed it up.": "Ron",
  "Comics are a dying art. If you ask a little kid to choose between a video game with insane graphics or comic books... you have to compete with cable, satellite TV with its thousands of channels, and with video games that are like movies, with CGI explosions where you can blow up worlds.": "Glenn",
  "Hollywood is a boys' club, and that's something I thought was a stereotype - and it's not. That really shocked me. Still shocks me. Everyone's helping their buddies out and pressing their buddies and playing tennis with their buddies and making movies with their buddies, and that grosses me out.": "Emily",
  "I am a cynical optimist. Big opening weekends are like cotton candy. The films you will remember over time are the films that stick in the consciousness of the audience in a good way.": "Robert",
  "I'm afraid that eating in restaurants reflects one's experiences with movies, art galleries, novels, music - that is, characterized by mild amusement but with an overall feeling of stupidity and shame. Better to cook for yourself.": "Jim",
  "I have a very busy life, and not many people who have a career and four kids go out a lot to the movies.": "Meryl",
  "My mother and my sisters - five girls - were crazy about glamour and Hollywood movies. I styled myself on Veronica Lake and Marlene Dietrich.": "Jerry",
  "I'd love to win trophies, be in movies, have a body of work I'm proud of and find a way to enjoy it along the way. Success is probably a more of a complicated thing than that.": "Demetri",
  "I will make action movies, I think, for a few more years, another five years.": "Jackie",
  "When I got depressed, I watched Bruce Lee movies. I learned everything from Bruce Lee.": "Jackie",
  "I don't think people are experiencing superhero fatigue. Do you hear people complaining that there are too many action movies? I think it's good entertainment.": "Michael",
  "'Spider-Man' seems to have a different tone to the pure Marvel stuff, but I really enjoyed the 'Guardians Of The Galaxy' and 'Iron Man' movies. I love the special effects and how it seems very real, but at the same time, it still lives within the realm of Marvel. That's got to be a lot of work.": "Michael",
  "Some horror movies are just for shock value, so it doesn't really feel scary.": "Michael",
  "Sometimes it's more difficult to exist as a female lead, especially in action movies because all those men are around you. They take so much place.": "Monica",
  "I think it's too easy often to find a villain out of the headlines and to then repeat that villainy again and again and again. You know, traditionally, America has always looked to scapegoat someone as the boogie man... there is a tradition in the most simplistic of action movies for there to be some horrible villain.": "Edward",
  "There's an idea that action movies are more attractive to one gender than the other or different kinds of people or whatever. The truth is action is not any different than any other part of a story.": "Patty",
  "Where I come from, it was a heresy to say you wanted to be in movies, leave alone American movies.": "Daniel",
  "If you're strutting around Beverly Hills and hitting up these big industry parties every night when you're not making movies, then it's going to eventually consume you. But for me, I live most of my life in Boston. I do things no different from the way my buddies back home do them, except when I go to work, I go to a film set.": "Chris",
  "I stopped making movies because I don't like taking my clothes off. Maybe it's realism, but in my opinion, it's utter filth.": "Debbie",
  "The go-to reflex all over Hollywood is still likeability. I've always had a problem with it because I think I have a weird barometer in the sense that some of the characters I've cared about the most in movies are characters that are often thought of as despicable.": "Damien",
  "I find L.A. kind of romantic, actually. As a movie junkie, it's a city that was built by the movies. There's something really weird and surreal about it that I find energizing.": "Damien",
  "I like movies that are specific. Movies that home in on a very specific subculture, a specific discipline, a specific world.": "Damien",
  "'La La Land' is about the city I live in. It's about the music that I grew up playing it's about movies that I grew up watching. Even the big spectacle of the movie feels private to me in that way. ": "Damien",
  "I really like action movies. The 'Die Hard' franchise. And the 'Bourne' movies.": "Alexa",
  "It's not like I'm the first man ever to do this, y'know? You gotta go back to Nat King Cole, Bing Crosby and Sammy Davis Jr. Those are people who've done music well and movies well, and y'know, Frank Sinatra and Elvis and all these dudes have made the transition. I don't know about Elvis, 'bout doin' 'em good, y'know? It's nothin' new.": "Ice",
  "Tarantino's movies are smartly intoxicating cocktails of rampage and meditation; they're in-your-face, with a mac-10 machine pistol and a quote from the Old Testament. They blend U.S. and European styles of filmmaking; they bring novelistic devices to the movie mall.": "Richard",
  "The people who run Hollywood are supposed to be masters at creating drama, suspense, thrills - at putting on a great show. If we knew not only who the winners were but also by how much they won, the Oscar show could actually be the Super Bowl of movies.": "Richard",
  "Movies are not about the weekend that they're released, and in the grand scheme of things, that's probably the most unimportant time of a film's life.": "Quentin",
  "In the kind of films that I do, there is an extremely limited number of people that can improvise. The reason the ensemble continues in the movies is because those are the people that can do that kind of work. It's not just an accident those people are in the film.": "Christopher",
  "When I'm writing fiction, I read nonfiction or biographies. Now I'm watching very old movies or old foreign films. I don't immerse myself in whatever's going on in whatever area I'm working in.": "Whit",
  "I am a massive film geek, and I love movies.": "James",
  "With 'Girls'... I feel like there's an impulse to try to make it look better or neater or more perfect, and when I watch theater, television, movies, it's always the imperfection I'm always more attracted to.": "Adam",
  "I don't watch the movies I'm in - ever. Sometimes I keep pictures, but that's it. I used to watch my movies, because I didn't want to be rude to the people making them, but I stopped a few years ago. I think it's pretty common among actors. It's like listening to your own voice, but multiplied by a million.": "Jesse",
  "Before movies, memory unspooled differently in the mind, trailing off in dust-blasted fade-out rather than spliced-together flashback; before photography, memory rippled like a reflection on water's surface, less precise but more profoundly true.": "Steve",
  "I don't want to make movies for kids, and I don't want to make movies for adults either.": "Kristen",
  "I had to act in a school play when I was about ten years old. I really didn't want to do it. But everyone had to do it so I didn't have a choice. A talent agent came and watched it and later gave me some work. It's funny because I'd always known that I wanted a movie career. I just didn't think that I would be in the movies.": "Kristen",
  "Sometimes I have a melody in my head; sometimes it's just a verse. I read lines from a book or movies that I watch and grab a few quotes and start writing on paper. From there, I record a really rough version and work on the song.": "Yuna",
  "We need Hollywood to make movies and television shows about sexy female engineers.": "Chelsea",
  "I didn't have any ambition to produce big mainstream popcorn movies.": "Jodie",
  "I don't know if I see myself as really an action hero, but I like doing physical movies and I like doing movies where the writing is very lean.": "Jodie",
  "I've always had this idea that I wanted movies to make people better not worse.": "Jodie",
  "Robots have a rich and storied history in movies.": "John",
  "I grew up on the Roger Moore and Sean Connery Bond movies, so the DNA of my spies is extremely ridiculous and goofy.": "Nick",
  "A huge part of acting in movies is appetite. You do your best work when you've got a lot of appetite and you really want to embrace something. When you get tired, you don't have that hunger.": "Clive",
  "Sometimes in movies, I still have to be the hero, but it's not all that important to me anymore.": "Dennis",
  "Before I was an actor, I was never able to hold a job for more than 3 months for some reason. It just wouldn't hold my interest, so there was some way that I wound up quitting or getting fired from it. But being an actor is perfect, because movies usually take about three months to shoot. Then it's over and they say, 'Hey, great job!'": "Dennis",
  "Music is fun, but I'm an ice skater. I may sing songs and do shows, make movies and other things... that's all well and good and I enjoy it, and I would never trade any of those for anything. But figure skating is who I am.": "Johnny",
  "I've turned down twentysomething million dollars for movies.": "Vin",
  "The movies are all about visual, and television is all about character and dialogue.": "Theresa",
  "If you lined up 10 writers and asked them to write a movie about Steve Jobs, you'd get 10 very different movies.": "Aaron",
  "I just knew that was what I wanted to do. I was going to perform as a singer; I was going to perform as a dancer, and I was, you know, going to do movies and be an actress. I was going to do it or die trying. That's what my life was.": "Jennifer",
  "I didn't watch horror movies when I was a kid. I didn't watch any bad movies.": "Colin",
  "If I wanted to make spy movies for the rest of my life, that would be one thing, but I don't want to just make spy movies.": "Daniel",
  "When we talk about Oscars, it's almost as a symbol of excellence, and the American public and the worldwide public accept that symbol. So, a movie like 'The Artist' that costs $14 million, has to go out and compete with movies that cost $140 million. How does David deal with Goliath?": "Harvey",
  "I like the idea of movies having a magic element. How many times have you seen an actor in a movie who you know only as the character? It's wonderful, isn't it?": "Christian",
  "There are very few movies in English about romantic obsession told with a seriousness of purpose.": "James",
  "I love New York. It just reminds me of so many movies... I look up at buildings, and feel like Godzilla should be climbing up them or something.": "Liam",
  "Saturday night at my house, I often trot out classic movies and force the urchins to watch them. There is much wailing and gnashing of teeth, but I think it's important to teach kids about American culture, and films are certainly a big part of it.": "Bill",
  "My movies just kind of sneak up on you. I don't have to worry too much about what everybody is going to say. Anyway, I really don't pay attention to what the world says about my movies. I just care about what my buddies think.": "Adam",
  "It's just weird that for some people, art is a luxury. My parents had no artistic outlet. Some people pass down music to their kids, but I couldn't tell you what my mom's or dad's favorite song is. So when I started going out into the world, I was drawn to people who knew about movies, art, even fashion.": "Channing",
  "I've been on so many movies. Generally, I haven't gotten to be on the ground level. As of two years ago, in 'Dear John,' I got to really be on the ground floor. I wasn't a producer. I felt like I put the work in, and I did have a lot of sway on what got fixed, reshoots, so on and so forth. It felt really good.": "Channing",
  "I'm not someone who sits at home and doesn't like to go out, doesn't like to watch movies. I like to live my life.": "Virat",
  "The greatest thrill is that moment when a thousand people are sitting in the dark, looking at the same scene, and they are all apprehending something that has not been spoken. That's the thrill of it, the miracle - that's what holds us to movies forever. It's what we wish we could do in real life.": "Mike",
  "As much as I would love to do roles in big movies and am keen to establish myself in the industry. I don't want to sacrifice things that I really enjoy, like spending time with my family and friends.": "Will",
  "Making movies has become such a golden ring, and it's all such a big business, that the rewards system has gotten totally out of whack. Suddenly, you're treated in a manner befitting someone who is actually an important person.": "Ben",
  "I came to the plain fields of Ohio with pictures painted by Hollywood movies and the works of Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller. None of them had much to say, if at all, about Dayton, Ohio.": "Chitra",
  "Photoshop makes things look beautiful just as you have special effects in movies. It's just a part of life.": "Erin",
  "I'm not into superhero movies, but I love cartoons. Tweety bird is my favourite.": "Deepika",
  "I didn't want people to think I'm just in the movies, where you make money and wait around for 13 hours before you get to do 20 minutes of work.": "D.",
  "The only thing I find difficult to watch - horror movies - not that I don't like them. Like 'The Shining,' it's one of my favorite movies, but it's terrifying. I feel like I've watched a marathon afterwards.": "Nikolaj",
  "I absolutely love genre movies. When I was a kid, I was really impacted by genre films and cult classics.": "Lucas",
  "The secret to film is that it's an illusion.": "George",
  "I've never been that much of a money guy. I'm more of a film guy, and most of the money I've made is in defense of trying to keep creative control of my movies.": "George",
  "Changes are not unusual - I mean, most movies, when they release them, they make changes. But somehow, when I make the slightest change, everybody thinks it's the end of the world.": "George",
  "The movies I like watching the most are these sort of cinema verite, handheld films where you really get gritty with people. But I also have this strange affinity for old Rock Hudson/Doris Day movies and things that sort of pop out where you see the frames, where you have these 2D animation moments and split-screens and things like that.": "James",
  "I would do anything for a part, nearly anything. Being in movies doesn't mean being pretty.": "Diane",
  "Well, Toronto, I consider to be the birthplace of my films. I've made three films and this is the third one to premiere here in the same theater on the same day at the same time - they are my audience. They're the people that I think about while I'm writing, directing, and editing. I specifically make movies for them.": "Jason",
  "It can have an enormous effect because big budget movies can have big budget perks, and small budget movies have no perks, but what is the driving force, of course, is the script, and your part in it.": "Morgan",
  "I think with movies I am really connecting to the Joseph Campbell idea of the collective unconscious.": "Will",
  "In today's world, America's soft power is commonly thought to reside in the global popularity of Hollywood movies, Coca-Cola, McDonald's and Starbucks.": "Ahmed",
  "I feel sorry for people who only know comic books through movies. I really do.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "I'm not an admirer of action movies. I just think, Oh my God, it must be so tiring.": "Catherine",
  "Live theater to me is much more free than the movies or television.": "Eartha",
  "I'll tell you what I really enjoy. We all go to the movies, we all watch television, we know what they're about, how they work. When the main character is a cop or a spy, it's very exciting, but I also very much enjoy when the main characters are nobodies - a trucker.": "Nathan",
  "I remember my first taste of American big movies was 'Ghost Rider.' I'm in two little scenes. But for those two little scenes they had 400 extras, upside-down stunt cars, and a fire brigade.": "Rebel",
  "My entertainment was going to the local dollar movie theatre on the weekend, where I watched old black and white movies. If you wanted current movies, you had to drive to the big city.": "L'Wren",
  "All that running around in my underwear put money in my pockets. I can focus on working in interesting movies without having to worry about supporting myself.": "Mark",
  "'The Lunchbox' is the kind of cinema that is true to its word and not cluttered or corrupted by some of the mainstream pre-requisites. I love the way I make movies, but there are certain stories that need to be told in a certain way, and 'The Lunchbox' is that movie, and I'm so proud to present this movie.": "Karan",
  "Whether or not we communicate it, I definitely seek my mom's acceptance and approval for everything. She has a strong commercial sense of movies and is a quintessential audience. When she doesn't like something, I know there is reason to worry. When she loves something, there is reason to celebrate.": "Karan",
  "I met Hugh Jackman, and I was like, 'I love your movies!' And, of course, he asked, 'Which one?' A reasonable question, but I blanked completely. In that moment, I couldn't remember a single film that Hugh Jackman had done. So I copped out. 'The recent one!' And that was one of his biggest disasters. Well done, me.": "Karan",
  "Making movies is controlled anarchy, chaos.": "Michael",
  "One of the nice things about books as opposed to television and movies to some extent is it's not a passive entertainment. People really do get involved, and they do create, and they do have their own visions of what different characters look like and what should happen. It's great - it means their brains are working.": "James",
  "Commercial books don't even get covered. The reason why so many book reviews go out of business is because they cover a lot of stuff that nobody cares about. Imagine if the movie pages covered none of the big movies and all they covered were movies that you couldn't even find in the theater?": "James",
  "I think it would be very boring dramatically to have a film where everybody was a lawyer or doctor and had no faults. To me, the most important thing is to be truthful.": "Spike",
  "A lot of times you get credit for stuff in your movies you didn't intend to be there.": "Spike",
  "Movies are not scripts - movies are films; they're not books, they're not the theatre.": "Nicolas",
  "Mirrors are the essence of movies.": "Nicolas",
  "Our memory and the movies keep movie stars alive for us, and Tony Curtis is still a star.": "Nicolas",
  "Women's roles in the movies remain, for the most part, girlfriends, mothers, wives.": "Rebecca",
  "I've played a lot of mothers in my movies.": "Vera",
  "I like all of the mental, psychological thriller movies too. I enjoy horror movies across the board.": "Sophia",
  "I've been in so many good movies that I felt like nobody saw it's a pretty dreadful feeling. ": "Woody",
  "People wrestle sometimes making movies, and I think that conflict is a very essential thing. I think a lot of very happy productions have produced a lot of very banal movies.": "Edward",
  "We've all seen 'Network' and 'Wag the Dog,' but we were somehow insulated by the fact that those were just movies, fictions, and we could rest easy that the Real News doesn't operate that way. Well, it does - sometimes.": "Peter",
  "People go to the movies to have an emotional experience, not to learn information they could look up on Wikipedia.": "Peter",
  "Whether it's the experiments on 'MythBusters' or my earlier work in special effects for movies, I've regularly had to do things that were never done before, from designing complex motion-control rigs to figuring out how to animate chocolate.": "Adam",
  "Why not premiere movies on Netflix the same day they're opening in theaters? Listen to the consumer give the consumer what they want. ": "Ted",
  "There's nothing more important in making movies than the screenplay.": "Richard",
  "The only reason anyone goes to Broadway is because they can't get work in the movies.": "Bette",
  "Hollywood has the idea that movies have to be dumb. But especially movies for or about teenagers have to be really dumb!": "Joseph",
  "After 'Prom Night' I did two movies where I was playing a prostitute. I gravitate towards characters that have some sort of inner turmoil or some sort of character arc. That's the great thing about acting, so many different things and being really diverse in your choices.": "Brittany",
  "My dad sat me in front of the TV, and instead of putting on Nick Jr. or something, he put me in front of 'Jailhouse Rock' and all the Elvis movies.": "Drake",
  "I like mainstream movies that are completely off the wall.": "Robert",
  "I spent my entire youth in front of a TV watching old movies, and as soon as I was able to get a subway pass, when I was 14, I joined the Museum of Modern Art and was there all weekend watching old movies.": "Amy",
  "When I make a film I'm away from home for two to three months. So I want my kids to look at my films one day and say, I love his movies, I love his choices-because he loved them.": "Kevin",
  "I've had some movies that have been ridiculed, but that's OK with me. I don't feel that really defines me. Should I change who I am to be popular?": "Kevin",
  "I want to make movies that pierce people's hearts and touch them in some way, even if it's just for the night while they're in the cinema; in that moment, I want to bring actual tears to their eyes and goosebumps to their skin.": "Russell",
  "I lost my front tooth in rugby league when a fat guy from Bellevue Hill kicked me in the face as I got up from a tackle to mark him. I made this decision not to cap the tooth because I thought it was false. But I didn't make any movies as a teenager, and I had a very hard time with girls and stuff.": "Russell",
  "It's the contemporary woman that movies don't know what to do with, other than bathe her in a bridal glow in romantic comedies where both the romance and the comedy are artificial sweeteners.": "James",
  "Right after 'The Wackness' came out, it was a really exciting time, and then it was a bit disappointing when it came out. Even though not that many people saw it, I was still getting offered some movies. I was thinking that people would just stop calling me since it didn't do very well at the box office.": "Jonathan",
  "Go see it and see for yourself why you shouldn't go see it.": "Samuel",
  "Why should people go out and pay money to see bad films when they can stay at home and see bad television for nothing?": "Samuel",
  "I get inspiration from literally everything and anything. I take inspiration from people, relationships, stories, and I take inspiration from movies I see, books I read and songs I hear.": "Sabrina",
  "What really matters is your movies and how good a person you are. Otherwise, tabloids and news channels writing about you only builds your curiosity and stardom and propels you to reach wider places.": "Ranbir",
  "Comedy. It was just huge in my house. Peter Sellers and Alec Guinness, Monty Python and all those James Bond movies were highly regarded.": "Mike",
  "I hate when the sun is high and there are no shadows. If I could do super high-budget movies, I would only shoot when the sun starts to get low - but you can't just shoot for four hours every day.": "Susanne",
  "I've always been slightly hesitant about generalizing movies made by men and women being different in their nature; I think movies by each director are different. Having said that, I think that it's kind of disgraceful that there aren't more female directors.": "Susanne",
  "I've been lucky, I've had movies that made a lot of money, so I don't feel like I have to kill every time out. I don't want that pressure. I don't need it.": "Bill",
  "I've never made any horrible, horrible movies. If you don't ruin your reputation, you can always get work.": "Bill",
  "I've been into horror movies ever since I was five years old.": "Kirk",
  "The same sensations that you get in heavy metal are in horror movies. Heavy metal sounds evil and horror movies are evil, ha ha!": "Kirk",
  "I really don't have any solutions and I don't like movies that do.": "Charlie",
  "Trying to constantly get yourself into movies is extremely stressful and sometimes just impossible.": "Seth",
  "Growing up I didn't watch movies.": "Denzel",
  "Being alone is scarier than any boogey man and the reason why I don't choose to see Horror movies as a rule.": "Tom",
  "If you don't like my movies, don't watch them.": "Dario",
  "True violence, not the kind you usually see in television or movies, touches something very deep and primal in people.": "Mark",
  "In India, there is a psychological problem that movies going to film festivals are boring. It is a problem with exhibitors.": "Anurag",
  "My agent said, 'You aren't good enough for movies.' I said, 'You're fired.'": "Sally",
  "If you can market smut and toilet paper, you can market movies.": "Dawn",
  "I would love to have more kids. Kids are the best part of my day. I don't wake up to make movies. I wake up to hang out with my family.": "Reese",
  "I love movies.": "Greg",
  "I did 14 movies in six years, I had a cartoon TV show, and I don't want to do that again. I just want to make unique pieces of art. That's why I quit everything when I was 14 and sat around for eight years before I did another movie.": "Macaulay",
  "I try to watch a movie a day, if not more, and through movies, I learned about so many different political themes I hadn't been interested in and cultural things I hadn't been aware of and economic factors I hadn't thought about.": "Hideo",
  "'Little Miss Sunshine' snowballed. It was a tiny movie. We shot it in 30 days, and it was really fun to do, but it was one of those small movies that you don't hold out huge hope for.": "Greg",
  "I guess you just feel like there's a whole story that's not being told in movies. You're only seeing the macho guy version of a story that from the woman's side, may be completely different.": "Heather",
  "So I know how I watch movies which is on my laptop, man. And that's how I suspect a lot of people do it.": "Kevin",
  "Hitchcock had a charm about him. He was very funny at times. He was incredibly brilliant in his field of suspense.": "Tippi",
  "When I started to watch some of the films I'd done, I realized I was doing movies that I might not actually want to see.": "Heath",
  "Movie magic is movie magic and acting magic is acting magic.": "Ben",
  "I always wanted to be a stay-at-home dad making art, making movies.": "Robert",
  "I do like strong women in my movies. I have five sisters, so I've just grown up with that model.": "Robert",
  "We ogle plants and animals up close on television, the Internet and in the movies. We may not worship the animals we see, but we still regard them as necessary physical and spiritual companions. Technological nature can't completely satisfy that yearning.": "Diane",
  "Besides the fact that I make movies, there's nothing interesting about my life at all, unfortunately.": "Jonah",
  "I just like to act and write and produce. To me, making movies is the ultimate goal.": "Jonah",
  "All the movies that I have done I have not been in control of. Sometimes there is a contractual situation where you go to the studio, and they kind of tell you which ones they want you to do.": "Steven",
  "I love swimming, tennis, and I am taking up golf. I am not serious about it, I just go to the range and practice. Other than that, I enjoy going to the movies and hanging out with my friends.": "Mila",
  "When I was a little girl, I watched all old movies. My mother liked old movies, and she loved shopping for antiques, so I was around old things all the time.": "Dita",
  "I just think old old movies, they make you concentrate and pay attention so much more. They feel so warm. A lot of modern digital videotape, it's just too bright. Don't know why, it's not warm.": "Jack",
  "I missed out on everything. Sometimes on the street I see teenagers hanging out and going to the movies, going to concerts, and I get so jealous.": "Adriana",
  "I never cared about making one coherent masterpiece with a conventional narrative. I always wanted my movies to have images falling from all directions in a vaudevillian way. If you didn't like what was happening in one scene, you could just snooze through it until the next scene.": "Harmony",
  "I'm so sick of seeing these movies where married couples are just cuddling on the couch and caressing each other's faces.": "Leslie",
  "My biggest challenge is to not do urban movies for the rest of my life, those alpha hoodies.": "John",
  "I have kind of a funny relationship with movies. I don't have to see the whole movie to get an impression of it or to let it have an influence on me.": "Lana",
  "I've had broken bones and cuts and dashes and tears from movies, but when I was five, my mom put the biscuits up high so we wouldn't be helping ourselves. So, one day I asked to stand up on a chair to get a biscuit, and it fell, and the corner of the chair went right into the side of my eye, and it made a big hole in there.": "Gerard",
  "You can make a thousand different movies about the same subject.": "Pedro",
  "Everybody gets typecast in movies, but you have to make wise choices. I'd say around 90 percent of movie casting is about the way you look, so you have to fight that. If producers had their way, I'd only be in action films, but I'm interested in a more varied career than that.": "Famke",
  "Ultimately, if you look at all my films from 'Bloody Sunday' on, they're steeped in a post-9/11 atmosphere. 'United 93' is directly about 9/11, of course, but every one of the movies deals with paranoia, mistrust, and fear.": "Paul",
  "It's a juggernaut, yeah... but I'm not phased by making movies.": "Matthew",
  "When I was a little boy I used to borrow my father's hat, and make a press card to stick in the hat band. That was the way reporters were always portrayed in the movies.": "Charles",
  "You won't find me in a romantic comedy. Those movies don't speak to me. People don't come to talk to me about those scripts, because they probably think I'm this dark, twisted, miserable person.": "Naomi",
  "If I have to produce movies, direct movies, whatever to change the way Hollywood treats older women, I'll do it. If I have to bend the rules, I will. If I have to break them, I will.": "Naomi",
  "I don't know that movies are important. But I know that stories are important. Movies may disappear. They've only been around, for God's sake, for the last hundred years... I think that it's the need to tell stories, and that people need to be told stories. It's the old sitting around the fire, you know.": "Allison",
  "You still get the movies made. A filmmaker can always scrape up money to do a movie. The passion drives it. And you'll get the money. Money's the easiest thing. But the hardest thing is finding a way for people to see your movie.": "Allison",
  "I don't like to watch my own movies - I fall asleep in my own movies.": "Robert",
  "I quit doing the movies because the wrestling was going so good and was so on fire during the '80s and '90s, but I was getting all these movie scripts.": "Hulk",
  "Movies have these transcendent moments where everything is just right, from the dialogue to the music to the lighting to the narrative context; everything is just perfect, and something magical happens - the film breaks through the screen and does something to you.": "Jason",
  "Books and movies are different art forms with different rules. And because of that, they never translate exactly.": "Tom",
  "I don't see my movies. I think it's healthier and safer to keep a bit of distance. I'm afraid to be disappointed.": "Bernardo",
  "I don't see my movies. When you ask me about one of my movies, it just goes in my memory because maybe sometimes I confuse one for another. I think all movies are like sequences, which is the body of my work.": "Bernardo",
  "My passion is capturing what it feels like to love, be it romantic or otherwise. I love to watch two people realize what they meant for each other - and that goes across all media, books, TV, movies, personal essays; everything.": "Taylor",
  "They allow us to disrespect our Black woman. A lot of these things would be considered criminal if it were to be carried out in the streets. That's like when they tell you after you buy your VHS and you rent movies they tell you not to copy the movies.": "Afrika",
  "Making movies is just like betting on horses at the racetrack.": "Maureen",
  "There is the moral spectrum in 'Fargo,' and you see it in other Coen brothers movies, where you have a very good character on one end and a very bad character on the other.": "Noah",
  "A producer is always behind the scenes, even more in the movies - nobody sees you. I didn't even meet most of the actors. When I worked on 'Top Gun,' I never met Tom Cruise. You were always in the background.": "Giorgio",
  "It's all about escapism. That's essentially what all movies are about. It's a vicarious thrill.": "Todd",
  "I love making movies, and being in any that I can be in. I'd like to be in those giant movies, as the fifth or sixth lead, and have three or four killer scenes. You don't have the responsibility of the entire movie being on you. I like those roles. I'm shooting for the middle.": "Bill",
  "Family entertainment is really very necessary in our culture. Look how profitable they are. It's almost not discretionary. You need to take your family to the movies.": "Gary",
  "As a kid growing up in a small town in Washington State, my only exposure to New York City was through movies. The town with its towering skyscrapers, fascinating people and teeming energy absolutely captivated me.": "Robert",
  "I love dancing just because I've done it my whole life and it's definitely what I want to do. I feel like, I want to train with acting and do movies. Those two are my main priorities. I definitely want to be able to sing and model, too. I definitely love those, too.": "Maddie",
  "I think movies are a director's medium in the end. Theater is the actor's medium. Theater is fast, and enjoyable, and truly rewarding. I believe in great live performance.": "Sam",
  "The movies that influenced me were movies that told their stories through pictures more than words.": "Sam",
  "I love horror movies because they're really fun. They tap into those wonderful primal emotions.": "Margot",
  "It's seldom that you find great moments in television. Usually you remember - in 'Breaking Bad' or any of these other great shows - you remember situations or characters. Not moments. But I have to say, I can make the same argument for mainstream movies, which have bad narratives and also no memorable moments.": "Alfonso",
  "I get ideas from everywhere: movies, books, movies, nature - it comes into my brain, it sits there for a while, and it starts coming back out.": "Tony",
  "I look at myself as an audience member. I still love movies, and I still go and sit in the back of the big dark room with everybody else, and I want the same thrill.": "Samuel",
  "I think 'North by Northwest' and 'Rope' and Rear Window' and 'Psycho' are on my list of favorite all time movies. I just think his kind of command as a director was almost unparalleled, and I feel like in certain ways the sort of character-based thriller owes more to Hitchcock than anyone.": "Carlton",
  "Movies portray men as tough guys.": "Geoffrey",
  "We spend all this energy keeping our lives normal and safe and predictable, and the result is that our approved cultural safety valve is the movies. So in films, anyway, the hero is obliged to represent the continuance of social values and institutions, and his permission to act is much more seriously limited than the villain's.": "Peter",
  "Even if I set out to make a film about a fillet of sole, it would be about me.": "Federico",
  "The dubbing of the music and effects is really incredible today. You're feeling gun shots. I mean, it's not the way people say it is, but the gunshot sounds real. And cars sound real. Among the many things in the evolution (of movies) is to make the sound in the movie incredible. That's what you feel.": "Joel",
  "I can't really remember my life without movies.": "Elle",
  "Life is short. I'm 47 years old. I've got 10 years to go where I can be the best I can be. I want those 10 years to be precious, not like before, cranking two or three movies a year. I've made a ton of movies in my life, but so what?": "Jean-Claude",
  "My body looks like 30 but my face looks like 50. But I cannot walk bare-chested in the streets. I like to do these movies to challenge myself physically.": "Jean-Claude",
  "I was studying to be an architect, I wasn't plotting to join the movies. Films were just another career option. I took acting up with the same schoolgirl enthusiasm I had for examinations. Acting is a job and I take it very seriously.": "Aishwarya",
  "I love to hang out with my friends and go to the movies. My mom and I are involved in the Mother/Daughter Organization - national charity work. Whenever I get free time, we volunteer. It's an organization so mothers and daughters can spend time together while volunteering.": "Hailee",
  "I've made 122 movies, and I daresay there's a picture of mine showing somewhere in the world every day.": "Tony",
  "I'm a spoilt brat. I thought I was just going to walk in and make movies. But I'd been my own boss for so long that all of a sudden to be facing a roomful of people who were niggling over every little scene... I just thought I'd go back and draw my comics and have a happy life.": "Frank",
  "I was dirt-poor. I could barely hold down a job. Eventually, though, I started getting small parts on shows like 'Smallville,' 'Supernatural'... and lots of really bad sci-fi movies. I was running around the woods in wolf contacts, covered in fake blood made out of pancake syrup, roaring.": "Cory",
  "I have a checklist of things I'd like to do in movies. One of them is get possessed. Die on a deathbed with a ghostly pallor - that's on my list.": "Talulah",
  "For a number of years, I'd been around the kind of people who financed movies and the kind of people who are there to make the deals for movies. But I'd always had this naive idea that everybody wants to make movies as good as they can be, which is stupid.": "David",
  "When you make the kind of movies I make, you get weird letters from people.": "David",
  "I think you really have to remember what you loved about making music in the first place. Ultimately, people can be like, 'We've seen this dude in many movies,' but if they hear a song and they're feeling it, they can look past all the personal things and not hold it against you that you're also an actor.": "Common",
  "I never enjoyed working in a film.": "Marlene",
  "I always loved silent movies. I was not a specialist, but I loved them. And when I started directing, I became really fascinated by the format - how it works, the device of the silent movie. It's not the same form of expression as a talkie. The lack of sounds makes you participate in the storytelling.": "Michel",
  "I'm not a huge fan of scary movies, but I love doing them because your character arc gets condensed, and everything is elevated, and so you kind of have this amazing opportunity to go in many different places.": "Imogen",
  "I used to love Kapil Dev and, like any schoolboy, wanted to become a cricketer till I started dreaming of making movies.": "Imtiaz",
  "I love going to the movies and getting Raisinets, a big tub of popcorn and a Coke. That's definitely a guilty pleasure because I can't be doing that all the time.": "Sanaa",
  "I think it's probably the Dutch who are to blame for starting the whole 'art business', because before they came along, art was attached to relatively stable structures, and it was everybody's. It was like going to the movies.": "Antony",
  "The two Hindi movies that I did were not marketed well, and so not many people came to watch the film, hence the audience doesn't know much about me. I am a newcomer, and I cannot sell a film on my own. There has to be a backing in terms of producers.": "Tena",
  "I do not fear anybody on the field or in society, but I fear at night when I am away from my parents. I am scared of the unknown described in horror movies.": "Saina",
  "With movies, you are always in search is a good story, one that everyone will relate to and love. I love finding those stories and creating a visual world to tell the story.": "Don",
  "For years in football I was angry with the game, angry with pundits and, a lot of the time, angry with the journalists writing about me. All that changed when I got my break in movies.": "Vinnie",
  "You know, usually with movies there are periods, dark areas, where I might not be getting what I wanted out of a theme. I'll have to go over and over it again.": "Trevor",
  "One of the joys of going to the movies was that it was trashy, and we should never lose that.": "Oliver",
  "In the movies, Bette Davis lights two cigarettes and hands the second one to James Cagney. It was just so glamorous and romantic.": "Loni",
  "I don't intentionally make deep movies.": "Hayao",
  "Movies are an art form that is very available to the masses.": "Richard",
  "I make movies I want to see.": "Neil",
  "There are some movies you do for the character there are some movies you do for the people. ": "Kajal",
  "Movies are a complicated collision of literature, theatre, music and all the visual arts.": "Yahoo",
  "I always loved clothes. I grew up in a blue-collar family, but I loved old movies and seeing all those dashing leading men.": "Joseph",
  "Come on, guys, I am a computer nerd. I love Hollywood and movies. My whole life is like a movie. I wouldn't be who I am if it wasn't for the mind-altering glimpse at the future in 'Star Wars.'": "Kim",
  "On planes I always cry. Something about altitude, the lack of oxygen and the bad movies. I cried over a St. Bernard movie once on a plane. That was really embarrassing.": "Michael",
  "I love Jared Hess' movies. He's such a weirdo and such a nice, funny guy.": "Kate",
  "These archetypal older women in movies can sometimes make my skin crawl. It's about the one dimension it's about the lack of any texture. ": "Patricia",
  "I have a sneaking suspicion that if there were a way to make movies without actors, George Lucas would do it.": "Mark",
  "I like something where I can really use my imagination and be an active participant in the construction of the monster and usually that's in the world of the supernatural or the world of the fantastic, so that's why those kinds of stories about demons and the supernatural appeal to me or maybe I'm really interested in that subject.": "Sam",
  "Everybody knows when you've got a role in a Spike Lee movie, you're gonna blow up. But I happen to be the only person who's had the lead in the two Spike Lee movies nobody saw.": "Anthony",
  "I like movies. Movies have afforded me a modicum of luxuries. The thing about the movies is, if you're bad in a movie, you're bad forever.": "Anthony",
  "I realized what interested me as a student of film was one thing and the movies that I liked were another.": "Sam",
  "What we're supposed to do as actors is be able to portray real human beings and emotions. And if you grow up in this bubble of showbiz and you only know people who make movies, you don't really have an understanding of the world outside.": "Emily",
  "I only make movies I want to go see.": "Jerry",
  "There are a lot of movies that inspire me to do what I do.": "Jerry",
  "Inspiration comes from everywhere. From life, observing people, etc. From movies and books you love. From research.": "Holly",
  "Movies are something people see all over the world because there is a certain need for it.": "Wim",
  "Film buffs who don't live in Hollywood have a fantasy about what it's like to be a director. Movies and the people who make movies have such glamour associated with them. But the truth is, it's not like that. It's very different. It's hard work.": "John",
  "There are a lot of movies that I don't care about, especially not remakes.": "John",
  "I play Xbox. I have a little boy to look after. I have dogs. You know, I have things to do. I would love to be able to sit down and watch something like a movie. I watch my own movies because I have to.": "Tom",
  "On the one hand, the press, television, and movies make heroes of vandals by calling them whiz kids.": "Ken",
  "I was that kind of kid that was going to the movies every weekend, I couldn't get enough of the movies, and now I get to make them. So I kind of have a one-track mind.": "Andrew",
  "Well, I'm a consumer as well. I go to the movies with my popcorn and believe everything I see.": "Kelly",
  "I'm just glad I've had these opportunities to be geeks in some really awesome movies.": "Christopher",
  "It's the story that counts.": "Vincente",
  "And there have certainly been movies I wanted to be in and milestones I wanted to surpass that did not happen.": "Thomas",
  "Some of the best roles are for women in these independent, smaller movies.": "Kyra",
  "I think in Europe, movies are made like a commodity and then sold as art.": "Christoph",
  "Shoot a few scenes out of focus. I want to win the foreign film award.": "Billy",
  "So I like to try to go back and develop pure visual storytelling. Because to me, it's one of the most exciting aspects of making movies and almost a lost art at this point.": "Brian",
  "And I always had this idea for making a movie about a femme fatale, because I like these characters. They're a lot of fun, they're sexy, they're manipulative, they're dangerous.": "Brian",
  "Filmmaking can be a fine art.": "Terri",
  "Today what is more important for me is performance. At the risk of sounding immodest, I have done it all - 61 movies over 12 years. But now I am looking for quality. It's easy to be a star. Now I want to be an actress.": "Karisma",
  "If you're sixty-something, pushing 70, the chances of you getting a tremendously fascinating part in the movies are very low, as to be almost negligible, or even in television. But in the theatre, there are still things to do, very interesting, very profound things.": "Brian",
  "I've always loved silent movies. I recently saw 'Tilly's Punctured Romance' at the Academy, which is the first comedy made with Charlie Chaplin in 1914, and I sat there, and I couldn't believe that the entire audience of 2,000 people were laughing that hard from a movie made in 1914 - and there were no words; it was all faces.": "Taylor",
  "I make movies for teenage boys. Oh dear, what a crime.": "Michael",
  "I make movies that audiences like, that I'd want to see. That's all.": "Michael",
  "I love doing big movies. It's awesome! You have all these toys. The thing I like about this movie is, like they always say, directors have the biggest train sets! Don't tell anyone, but I'd do this for free.": "Michael",
  "It's a great feeling to think that I can be a friend to so many people through my movies.": "River",
  "I've never seen 'The Goonies.' I've never seen 'Indiana Jones.' I watched 'UHF' over and over again when I was little, and that was it. I had no time for any other movies. I watched 'Naked Gun,' 'UHF,' and 'Airplane!' over and over.": "Eric",
  "The only movies I want to do are the ones I'm passionate about. I care about school, and I'm still a kid. I want to live like that while I can.": "Lily-Rose",
  "I just like movies that somehow expose the world in a way that's different than you imagine it.": "Alex",
  "I've always loved movies about con men. I think con men are as American as apple pie.": "Bill",
  "I'm always frightened away by movies that lower the bar on our endeavor to learn more about the crazy weird creatures that we are.": "Jason",
  "I figure you're only here for a matter of moments. Ever since I was a kid watching movies I've always wanted to make people laugh or have some sort of emotional reaction.": "Tim",
  "You read a script and its based on 'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction', and it goes right in the bin.": "Tim",
  "Little Odessa. Of all my movies, it's the one that I still really love when I watch it and I'm pretty happy with what I didn in that.": "Edward",
  "I live, therefore I make films. I make film, therefore I live. Life. Movement. I make home movies, therefore I live. I live, therefore I make home movies.": "Jonas",
  "I grew up loving monsters. I'm just a total monster geek. When I was a kid, I had the Aurora monster models, and I would make them. I loved the Universal horror movies and the Hammer movies. I just had an affinity for them.": "John",
  "The reason that I'm a writer today is because of Shakespeare and falling in love with Shakespeare when I was 8. That was through the movies, actually - through Olivier's 'Hamlet.' That was the first thing that got me to fall in love with Shakespeare and movies and everything in one big preadolescent rush.": "John",
  "It's harder than it looks to juggle all those things: relationship, movies, YouTube.": "Kian",
  "I loved Superman growing up. I saw a couple of those movies in the theater, and I watched 'Superman II' 8000 times.": "Stephen",
  "Everybody's a filmmaker today.": "John",
  "Real pirates were better than in movies, more daring and terrifying and cunning than any screenwriter could imagine. They operated during the Golden Age of Piracy, from 1650 to 1720.": "Robert",
  "I like a lot of classic movies, like, for example, 'Citizen Kane', James Dean movies, etc, etc.": "Tommy",
  "When I was a little kid, I wanted to be, like, you know, a movie star, you know? Or, I always have interest in movie, you know? Because I like the visual aspect of the movies, et cetera.": "Tommy",
  "We work very cost effective and I sell my movies in 100 territories on my own.": "Uwe",
  "That white uniform was her 'pass' to get into white places with us - the grocery store, the state fair, the movies. Even though this was the 70s and the segregation laws had changed, the 'rules' had not.": "Kathryn",
  "I'm proudest of the fact that I've been able to make a few movies in the studio system that are slightly unorthodox and personal. But it's never quite as easy as you dream that it could be.": "Cameron",
  "The movies we love and admire are to some extent a function of who we are when we see them.": "Mary",
  "You can map your life through your favorite movies, and no two people's maps will be the same.": "Mary",
  "I made over forty Westerns. I used to lie awake nights trying to think up new ways of getting on and off a horse.": "William",
  "You know how many movies it took Tom Cruise before he was making 5, 6 million dollars? It probably took a billion dollars in box office.": "Jason",
  "Without naming names, I think other movies look more realistic but they feel less real.": "Brad",
  "I would say the film world has stopped operating as one. We have divided it into Hindi movies, Bengali movies, Tamil movies and so on. Earlier, there was only one channel and we all knew what was going on. Today, it is hard to keep track of programmes due to the advent of regional channels.": "Mithun",
  "'E.T.' was the movie that made me want to make movies in the first place, and it was the first movie that made me focus on writing instead of what happens in the movie.": "Adam",
  "While I always thought of making sequels to movies like 'Ghayal,' the filmmakers would almost always veto the idea.": "Sunny",
  "But I did have two months off between Loser and the start of Prozac Nation. So, it was supposed to be Jason time, right? My time to enjoy myself away from movies.": "Jason",
  "In movies, it's so easy to have this 'boom,' to kill, and I think that's inhumane.": "Jacques",
  "I've always been a fan of movies well before I got involved in the industry. The magic that it brings and being able to, I guess, escape your troubles, escape whatever is going on in life and getting to live in this moment and in the story and live in the lives of these characters.": "Jovan",
  "I've been around a long time, and when I was at the top of the hill, I was very ahead of my time! Evidence of that is that my music is still current today - you know, rappers sample it all the time. So, rather than compromise my artistic integrity, I concentrated on movies.": "Isaac",
  "Barbra Streisand is without a doubt one of the most honest people I have ever known. There is no doubt in my mind that she will not be doing any more concerts. Of course, she still will be making records and starring and directing in movies.": "Marvin",
  "My mom and father are extremely proud. They love it when I don't die. I've done so many movies where I've died that their first question when I book a job is, 'So, are you going to die in this?'": "Michael",
  "Books are like movies of the mind and it's better to leave Kinsey where she is.": "Sue",
  "Making movies is a dangerous job. Because you are always the one who stands at the center of the universe when making movies.": "Emir",
  "I really want to meet and work with JJ Abrams. Everyone talks about what a nice director he is, and he has kids and stuff, so he sounds really awesome, not to mention he makes awesome movies.": "Ty",
  "Movies are a voyeuristic experience. You have to make the audience feel like they are peeking through a keyhole. I think of myself as the audience. Then I use light, framing, and motion to create a focal point.": "Haskell",
  "I think you get less takes on TV than in movies.": "Evan",
  "I think people would be most surprised to know that I love scary movies.": "Olivia",
  "Really interesting genre films, especially monster movies, evoke the fears of the times intentionally. Our starting point was 'Godzilla' - the original movie was released less than 10 years after Hiroshima, and it's a classic in Japan.": "Matt",
  "When Americans shoot movies they aim at the entire planet. When the French make movies, they aim at Paris.": "Jean-Jacques",
  "I don't hold with the notion that only bad books make good movies.": "Anthony",
  "After many decades of Disney movies, we have been conditioned to expect princesses to fall in love quickly with their charming princes and 'live happily ever after.'": "Mohamed",
  "I really realize the more movies I do just how important - it's so cliche when people say it, because everybody says it nowadays - but it's so important to keep it grounded. I totally understand what that means.": "Ken",
  "The subjects that I am working are movies that say something. They are shouting or criticising something. I would hate to play a princess waiting for the prince to come and give her a kiss.": "Golshifteh",
  "I have always been drawn to coming-of-age stories and books and movies featuring compelling young characters.": "Emily",
  "I always think that I'm the best thing in a lot of bad movies. Personally, I have to. I think that I like me as an actor.": "Matthew",
  "You just realize that at the beginning of 'Scooby' you're just going to start at level ten and stay at ten the entire time. It's hard. It physically beats you up. It's definitely one of the hardest movies you can do.": "Matthew",
  "I love all kinds of movies. I love a really good comedy and not the cheesy ones. My parents hate this, but I love horror films. Those are my favorite, and of course, dramatic roles. I'm really drawn to those as well. All different genres.": "Liana",
  "You know what I loved about 'Sideways'? Well, the wine, of course. But it was one of the few movies in which being a writer was realistically depicted. I loved how the Paul Giamatti character tries so ineptly to talk about his book.": "Kristan",
  "The movies I like to make are very rich and full of passion. Some people see me as an action director, but action is not the only thing in my movies. I always like to show human nature - something deep inside the heart.": "John",
  "I've been on the road since 1983. Nothing ever changed, even when I was doing TV and movies.": "Sinbad",
  "I met the Colonel when Elvis was recording some song I'd written for one of his movies. Elvis was just having fun with the gang and all the Memphis boys and Colonel Parker was sitting over here in like a theater seat.": "Mac",
  "I love horror movies. I mean, who doesn't like a good horror movie every once in a while? It's fun to get scared.": "Tara",
  "I'd like to make really important movies, like American Beauty. I was really proud to be a part of that movie.": "Allison",
  "I've always been really into action movies. Since I was little, that was my favorite type of film.": "Austin",
  "I don't watch horror movies because they scare me!": "Sarah",
  "I grew up with two sisters, and we owned three movies: 'Grease,' 'It's a Wonderful Life,' and 'Grease 2.' And you can only watch 'Wonderful Life' in the last half of the year. So I don't remember a time when I didn't know 'Grease.'": "Thomas",
  "There have been 14 versions that I can find of Burke & Hare movies. They have all been horror films and all the movies have taken place in Victorian times, which doesn't make any sense.": "John",
  "There are lots of great movies coming out of the U.S. but it's not something I've ever really been interested in. They're great films but I much prefer the smaller independent films, which are more thought provoking and experimental.": "Billie",
  "In all, I was in 16 movies, including 'The Bishop's Wife' with Cary Grant, Loretta Young and David Niven; I was in 'Rio Grande' with John Wayne, 'Albuquerque' with Randall Scott, 'Blue Skies' with Bing Crosby and 'Hans Christian Anderson' with Danny Kaye.": "Karolyn",
  "I'm not surprised that Spielberg was able to capture the heroism of Schindler so many of his movies are about the better part of mankind. ": "Gene",
  "I started as a journalist for magazines in New York City, so it was always storytelling. And moving into movies was a natural transition.": "Bruce",
  "I think you kind of hope for people to gush over movies, but I think the opposite way is great sometimes, too. I'd rather have a movie that you're angry about and that you're talking about the next day, than something you forget about when the popcorn goes into the trash.": "Gabriel",
  "I hate horror movies! I avoid them like the plague. I don't like getting scared.": "Danai",
  "While the notion that torture works has been glorified in television shows and movies, the simple truth is this: torture has never been an effective interrogation method.": "Jerrold",
  "Ah, in work, love and the movies, everything is a fight.": "Lina",
  "The Hollywood movies are more like novels, and the kinds of films I make are more like poems.": "Stan",
  "I used to go to two movies every week for the Saturday matinee when I was a kid.": "Mort",
  "I always wanted to play a boxer because some of my favorite films, as a boy, were those great boxing movies, like 'Raging Bull', 'Rocky', 'The Set Up', 'Fat City and Hard Times'. I just loved those films.": "Holt",
  "There's been a vacuum with movies that people can relate to. There's been a paucity of dramas that people can relate to. I think audiences are clamoring to connect - particularly after 9/11 - with things that are genuine and real and I think documentaries are filling that need.": "George",
  "I think the '70s are always inspiring to me. I was born then, so I have a lot of memories about how my parents were and what kinds of movies I was watching.": "Frida",
  "I grew up watching movies and television, and one day when I was really young I told my mom I wanted to become an actor, and she was really supportive and got me involved in local theater and commercials. From there I moved up to auditioning for movies and television.": "Cameron",
  "One of my favorite movies is 'Back to the Future'.": "Holland",
  "It was considered oh, not proper for children to go to the movies.": "Kitty",
  "Thank God for small movies and filmmakers who can make movies for not $8 million. Thank God for $8,000 movies.": "Trieste",
  "My parents were dismayed by my love of horror movies as a young girl, then even more dismayed when I kept rooting for Dracula to win instead of Van Helsing.": "Jeaniene",
  "Put the hero back in the super hero movies, because I think 'super' might have taken over.": "Max",
  "Every time I make a picture the critics' estimate of American public taste goes down ten percent.": "Cecil",
  "Nobody makes movies bad on purpose.": "Roland",
  "The best reason to go to the movies is to be with other people. Eating the popcorn, being with other people you don't know.": "Peter",
  "For me, honestly, one of the first movies I did I was always pounding coffee, and I crashed so horribly. So I've kind of weaned myself off. You keep getting second and third winds. But for me, I've stopped doing energy drinks or any kind of stimulant. I just kind of go natural.": "Nick",
  "Technology has not only changed the way people are able to view movies, it has changed the way our industry produces and advertises movies.": "Dan",
  "I just like that dynamic in relationships in movies where they're kind of lovers as rivals, you know?": "Marc",
  "Everyone has a first love, and mine was the western. When I was a child and dreamed of the movies, it was always as a cowboy on a white horse.": "Franco",
  "For me personally, I think I just enjoy movies about werewolves or vampires because it's not like an everyday thing. It's something you can really escape into.": "Agnes",
  "I have a saying: 'I'm good for three things: making fried bologna sandwiches, making money and picking out good movies.'": "Tyler",
  "My favorite types of movies to watch as a viewer are thrillers - I really have a soft spot for them, I love them. Especially psychological thrillers.": "Alex",
  "I loved scary movies growing up.": "Katie",
  "'Home Alone' was a movie, not an alibi.": "Jerry",
  "Cult movies are basically movies Hollywood missed the first time - that they should have gotten - and then the fans got it and made it successful.": "Troy",
  "Ultimately, there's always been a link between comic books and video games, and comic books and movies, and then basically all three steadily becoming this sort of transmedia.": "Troy",
  "There was never anything else I wanted to pursue. It was always theater, and movies are a fairly new thing.": "Ben",
  "I don't have a TV or watch movies. I don't like to be broadcast to, I want to participate.": "Pete",
  "It gets so boring at home. After all, how many reruns of Abbott and Costello movies can a guy watch on television?": "Bud",
  "I'm interested to see what happens to Spike Lee with limited resources, you know? I love Spike Lee's movies. But you know what? I kinda liked his movies when he used to scramble and fight more for them.": "Mark",
  "In the future, I kind of like the idea of doing music for film. I think that would be a nice job. I've always liked the sound aspect in movies. I guess once I have more instruments under my belt, it could be something I could do.": "Christopher",
  "When movies first came out, maybe they were in black and white and there wasn't any sound and people were saying the theater is still the place to be. But now movies and theater have found their own place in the world. They are each legitimate art forms.": "Hans",
  "The directing of a picture involves coming out of your individual loneliness and taking a controlling part in putting together a small world. A picture is made. You put a frame around it and move on. And one day you die. That is all there is to it.": "John",
  "In the next couple of years, part of every film's process is going to be to adjust the images. And it'll be to change the color of an actor's tie or change the little smirky thing he's doing with his mouth. Or you can put in more clouds or move the tree a little bit.": "Robert",
  "My only real contact with what my father did was that he could get 16-millimeter prints, so every weekend we would show two or three movies at home. But our house wasn't frequented by stars. My father's personal life was his personal life, and it was separate from his professional life.": "Stanley",
  "I grew up playing 'Mortal Kombat' as a kid. I was always a fan of the video game. Saw the movies as a kid as well.": "Brian",
  "The great art of films does not consist of descriptive movement of face and body but in the movements of thought and soul transmitted in a kind of intense isolation.": "Louise",
  "I enjoyed being in movies when I was a boy. As a child you're not acting - you believe.": "Roddy",
  "It's all about the sensuality of movement, every movement you make. That's why I love doing action movies. It's all about movement, dance - even if you're hitting someone in the face. You've got to sell it all with great passion. There's a narrative to the body. It's exactly the same as dance.": "DeObia",
  "Reality in movies is the reality of the story you're telling, so it may not match the reality as we know it, but the reason there's art is that it tries to bring some kind of understanding of all the suffering and joys and pain that we go through. Storytelling brings some value to it.": "Caleb",
  "Adding sound to movies would be like putting lipstick on the Venus de Milo.": "Mary",
  "While I'd like to make movies that are uplifting, there's always that part of you that goes, 'I want to play the evil guy because it's not me.' So anything that is not me is a challenge, and if I rise to the challenge, then I've kind of proved myself.": "Dean",
  "The difference between life and the movies is that a script has to make sense, and life doesn't.": "Joseph",
  "This is how I feel about horror films: there's enough scary things that happen in day-to-day life. Sometimes just going and getting the mail is scary, when you open your bills. And so, sometimes I feel like scary movies are just tapping into those anxieties and magnifying them.": "Josh",
  "Having my son made me grow up. I'm keeping my dangers in the movies.": "Tom",
  "I've done a lot of movies, but my favorite was 'Blind Faith.'": "Courtney",
  "I don't think I could compare myself to Macaulay Culkin, because we're pretty much two different kinds of actors. He's done a lot of comedy. He does mostly just comedy like 'Uncle Buck' and 'Home Alone' and 'Home Alone 2.' And I've done a lot of different stuff, like sad movies, like the movie about the kid with AIDS.": "Brian",
  "I learned at a very early age that life is a battle. My family was poor, my neighborhood was poor. The only way that I could get away from the awfulness of life, at that time, was at the movies. There I decided that my big aim was to make money. And it was there that I became a very determined woman.": "Susan",
  "I'm married to the theater but my mistress is the films.": "Oskar",

  "When the American spirit was in its youth, the language of America was different: Liberty, sir, was the primary object.": "Patrick",
  "We live in a time of conflict - external and internal - when we sometimes concentrate too much on what divides us. Today, fly the Stars and Stripes with pride and confidence that what unites is far stronger.": "Charlie",
  "Peasants, who after the liberation of the country became the masters of their lands and their country under the benevolence of Comrade Kim Il Sung, launched the campaigns for increasing agricultural production and donating cereals out of patriotism, and thus faithfully supported the Party's line of nation building.": "Kim",
  "But this Veterans Day, I believe we should do more than sing the praises of the bravery and patriotism that our veterans have embodied in the past. We should take this opportunity to re-evaluate how we are treating our veterans in the present.": "Nick",
  "To me, it seems a dreadful indignity to have a soul controlled by geography.": "George",
  "Nationalism is a silly cock crowing on his own dunghill.": "Richard",

  "The fight for freedom must go on until it is won; until our country is free and happy and peaceful as part of the community of man, we cannot rest.": "Oliver",
  "Patriotism has no appeal to us justice has. Party has no weight with us principle has. Loyalty is meaningless it depends on what one is loyal to. ": "A.",
  "Real patriotism is a willingness to challenge the government when it's wrong.": "Ron",
  "The same ambition can destroy or save, and make a patriot as it makes a knave.": "Alexander",

  "All the evils of France have been produced less by the perversity of the wicked and the violence of fools than by the hesitation of the weak, the compromises of conscience, and the tardiness of patriotism.

  "Protection and patriotism are reciprocal. This is the way which has led nations to greatness.": "John",

  "A nation is the same people living in the same place.": "James",
  "Next to the love of God, the love of country is the best preventive of crime.": "George",
  "I know it is very hard to rise above the influences of party prejudice. Often, it almost drowns the sentiment of patriotism. Party rancor and party hatred are the last serpents which the genius of patriotism can crush.": "Joseph",

  "The highest patriotism is not a blind acceptance of official policy, but a love of one's country deep enough to call her to a higher plain.": "George",
  "'My country, right or wrong' is a thing no patriot would ever think of saying except in a desperate case. It is like saying 'My mother, drunk or sober.'": "Gilbert",

  "A steady patriot of the world alone, The friend of every country but his own.": "George",
  "When I see someone in a military uniform I make it a point to approach them, shake their hand and say five words... 'thank you for your service.' 'Stars Earn Stripes' is a high energy, fun, action show, but at its heart it is all about those five words.": "Mark",
  "The patriot blood of my father was warm in my veins.": "Clara",

  "Patriotism is not a short and frenzied outburst of emotion but the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.": "Adlai",

  "One tell-tale sign of a Wingnut: they always confuse partisanship with patriotism.": "John",
  "To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary... is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds.": "Robert",
  "There is a fuzzy but real distinction that can and I believe should be made, between patriotism, which is attachment to a way of life, and nationalism, which is the insistence that your way of life deserves to rule over other ways of life.": "Todd",
  "Remember the Dreamers whose patriotism was praised when the Democratic House passed, and the Senate filibustered - the DREAM Act in 2010? Washington promised a path to citizenship, not just a roadblock to deportation.": "Christine",
  "Americans admire a people who can scratch a desert and produce a garden. The Israelis have shown qualities that Americans identify with: guts, patriotism, idealism, a passion for freedom. I have seen it. I know. I believe that.": "Richard",
  "I've been working with Pat Robertson on Africa debt-relief, and we disagree on virtually everything except certain very specific, inalienable rights, and the truth is that morality and patriotism come in all shapes and sizes.": "George",
  "America is not static. America is striving. And sometimes, America requires critique. Jingoism is an avoidance of realism. You can simultaneously love and be disappointed in the object of your love, wanting it to be better than it is. In fact, that is a measure of love. Honest critique is a pillar of patriotism.": "Charles",
  "The music industry's actions at the time of 9/11 and since have been actions driven by patriotism in most instances, and greed and stupidity to a lesser degree. Sounds like real life doesn't it?": "Ronnie",

  "There is a real patriotism underneath the best of my music but it is a critical, questioning and often angry patriotism.": "Bruce",

  "I hate patriotism... I can't stand it. It's a round world last time I checked.": "Bill",
  "Let no American imagine that Zionism is inconsistent with patriotism. Multiple loyalties are objectionable only if they are inconsistent.": "Louis",
  "I was weaned not on television or Wild West sagas but on stories of nationalism and patriotism. I would sit at my mother's feet by the hour and drink in these exciting tales of the freedom fighters in our family.": "Sukarno",

  "Xenophobia is dangerous, but patriotism is a good thing.": "Viktor",
  "Our entire family is replete with sentiments of patriotism. Uncle Swarna Singh left for his heavenly abode in jail in 1910, two or three years after my birth. Uncle Ajit Singh is leading the life of an exile in foreign countries.": "Bhagat",
  "Our nuclear scientists and engineers have done a splendid job, and naturally, the entire nation has risen to salute their professional excellence, discipline, and patriotism. They have had the benefit of having been led in the past by great men like Homi Bhabha and Vikram Sarabhai.": "Atal",
  "Look, I think Hispanic community - the values that resonate in our community are fundamentally conservative. They are faith, family and patriotism.": "Ted",
  "There's something I will say: In the U.S., people are very patriotic. Their patriotism is obvious. In France, for many years, you had to fight to be patriotic. People are pushing us from loving our own country.": "Marine",
  "Patriotism to your country is something that comes from your heart. It should be taught to you by your parents.": "Jesse",
  "What is it that unites, on the left of British politics, George Orwell, Billy Bragg, Gordon Brown and myself? An understanding that identity and a sense of belonging need to be linked to our commitment to nationhood and a modern form of patriotism.": "David",
  "My commitment to the Republican movement was pure and simply patriotism, a love of Australia... a desire or passion that all of our national symbols should be unequivocally and unambiguously Australian.": "Malcolm",
  "But presidential approval also became a surrogate measure of national unity and patriotism.": "Thomas",
  "I don't like the showy nationalism - a tattoo, wrapping yourself in a flag - that doesn't matter to me. The way to show your patriotism and commitment is to go and support or play for your team.": "Gary",

  "Patriotism is the religion of hell.": "James",

  "Every year in China, Internet executives are officially rewarded for their 'patriotism.'": "Rebecca",
  "I think patriotism is never racism.": "Marine",
  "Patriotism is a love of country. If you love your country, you should love your countrymen and women. It doesn't mean you always agree with them or even like them. It is understanding that we have interwoven destiny.": "Cory",
  "Our platform calls for a balanced deficit reduction plan where the wealthy pay their fair share. And when your country is in a costly war, with our soldiers sacrificing abroad and our nation facing a debt crisis at home, being asked to pay your fair share isn't class warfare - it's patriotism.": "Cory",
  "My position is that it isn't government's job to mandate patriotism. To me, mandating a pledge of allegiance to a government is something Saddam Hussein would do.": "Jesse",

  "I am unable to watch the Olympics due to the blustering jingoism that drenches the event. Has England ever been quite so foul with patriotism? The 'dazzling royals' have, quite naturally, hi-jacked the Olympics for their own empirical needs, and no oppositional voice is allowed in the free press.": "Morrissey",

  "The Montreal Olympics were in July 1976, the bicentennial, at the height of patriotism.": "Caitlyn",
  "Patriotism is best exemplified through auto-critique.": "Henry",
  "Patriotism is best exemplified through auto-critique.

  "When I was a kid, back in the '40s, I was a voracious comic book reader. And at that time, there was a lot of patriotism in the comics.

  "Patriotism is an ephemeral motive that scarcely ever outlasts the particular threat to society that aroused it.": "Denis",

  "It is the patriotic duty of every man to lie for his country.": "Alfred",
  "Every American soldier wants as much public support as he can possibly have. That's the soldiers on duty in Iraq, and that's me, as well. We fight better knowing that our people back home support us, back us, and understand what we're doing. It's hugely important.": "John",

  "But my patriotism goes for something beyond what we have. We don't have something that I want to die for - anymore.": "Jack",
  "Saving petrol is saving India's money. This is a sense of patriotism. The country can be energy-independent by energy conservation. I appeal to the other ministers also to do this.": "Veerappa",

  "Patriotism is an indispensable weapon in the defense of civilization against barbarism.": "Bill",
  "Jews have had to carry around their own sense of self in a carpet bag and I think perhaps too much emphasis might be being put on nationality and on the other hand patriotism, that sort of thing.": "Janet",
  "If terror groups are to be defeated, it is national governments that will have to do so. In nations like India, governments will have to call on the patriotism of citizens to fight the terrorists. In a nation like Pakistan, the government will have to be persuaded to deal with those in their midst who are complicit.": "Bill",
  "The aspects of patriotism that hush dissent, encourage going along, and sanction comfortable distancing and compliance with what is indecent and unacceptable... those aspects are too fundamental to ignore or gloss over.": "Bernadine",

  "I have a great belief in the future of my people and my country.": "Marian",

  "I have no sense of patriotism, but I do have a sense of community.": "Chrissie",
  "Politics is too partisan, and sometimes patriotism is cast aside. Patriotism is honor and love of your country and your brothers and sisters. With politics I get the impression that it's all about what's good for the party and not necessarily what's good for the country.": "Ricardo",
  "I don't think anyone has qualms in saying victory to the people of India. But when a political party appropriates such a slogan and says this is the definition of patriotism, those who say it are patriotic and those who don't are not patriotic, then I reject that definition.": "Palaniappan",

  "Patriotism has served, at different times, as widely different ends as a razor, which ought to be used in keeping your face clean and yet may be used to cut your own throat or that of an innocent person.": "Charles",
  "When a dog barks at the moon, then it is religion; but when he barks at strangers, it is patriotism!": "David",
  "Here's how I see obesity: as a symptom. The larger problem is over-consumption. In a society that identifies consumption with patriotism, valorizes 'growth' above all else and assigns status according to how much you consume, we compete with each other to see who can consume the most.": "Emily",
  "It seems that American patriotism measures itself against an outcast group. The right Americans are the right Americans because they're not like the wrong Americans, who are not really Americans.": "Eric",

  "I suppose I have become a sort of living monument in Portugal. But I come from a family with roots all over the world, so the idea of patriotism is not very strong in me. My country is the country of Chekhov, Beethoven, Velasquez - writers I like, painters and artists I admire.": "Antonio",

  "Faith is to believe what you do not see the reward of this faith is to see what you believe. ": "Saint",
  "Corruption is a cancer: a cancer that eats away at a citizen's faith in democracy, diminishes the instinct for innovation and creativity; already-tight national budgets, crowding out important national investments. It wastes the talent of entire generations. It scares away investments and jobs.": "Joe",
  "Without faith, nothing is possible. With it, nothing is impossible.": "Mary",

  "I am a bit of a hopeless romantic. I really do have a faith and a belief in love, and when I love, I love hard.": "Melanie",
  "I love tattoos. And mine symbolise who I really am. I have a Samurai on my left arm. At a subconscious level, I connect to this warrior and model myself on his discipline, skills and honour. There is also a tribal tattoo and a Chinese symbol of faith. I have seen a lot of people getting tattoos just because it's a trend.": "Virat",
  "The faith that anyone could move from rags to riches - with enough guts and gumption, hard work and nose to the grindstone - was once at the core of the American Dream.": "Robert",
  "We can never learn too much of His will towards us, too much of His messages and His advice. The Bible is His word and its study gives at once the foundation for our faith and an inspiration to battle onward in the fight against the tempter.": "John",
  "Faith must trample under foot all reason, sense, and understanding.": "Martin",
  "I always joke about letting the haters motivate you. Everybody has that in their life, people who doubt them or make them feel less than they are. It just takes faith and belief in yourself, and you've got to dig deep into that. That has to come from you - nobody's going to give you that.": "Jennifer",
  "Ever since the Crusades, when Christians from western Europe were fighting holy wars against Muslims in the near east, western people have often perceived Islam as a violent and intolerant faith - even though when this prejudice took root Islam had a better record of tolerance than Christianity.": "Karen",

  "Trust wholly in Christ rely altogether on His sufferings beware of seeking to be justified in any other way than by His righteousness. Faith in our Lord Jesus Christ is sufficient for salvation.

  "I always see the glass half full. I see the beauty in others, and I see the hope for tomorrow. If we don't have hope and faith, we have nothing.": "Craig",
  "When you're thirsty and it seems that you could drink the entire ocean that's faith when you start to drink and finish only a glass or two that's science. ": "Anton",

  "I see heaven's glories shine and faith shines equal.": "Emily",
  "A woman of faith is blessed by faithful men in her life who hold the priesthood of God and honor this privilege: her father, bishop, husband, brothers, sons.

They love her; they bless her.": "Margaret",
  "Do not tell secrets to those whose faith and silence you have not already tested.": "Elizabeth",
  "Trust is to human relationships what faith is to gospel living. It is the beginning place, the foundation upon which more can be built. Where trust is, love can flourish.": "Barbara",

  "The woman power of this nation can be the power which makes us whole and heals the rotten community, now so shattered by war and poverty and racism. I have great faith in the power of women who will dedicate themselves whole-heartedly to the task of remaking our society.": "Coretta",
  "The people that I grew up with had no problem with my faith. They did, however, seem very concerned that I would starve to death during Ramadan. I would explain to them that I have enough fat to live off of for three whole months, so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake.": "Maysoon",
  "Is it faith to understand nothing, and merely submit your convictions implicitly to the Church?": "John",

  "The future is as bright as your faith.": "Thomas",
  "Truth, according to the Christian faith, is God's love for us in Jesus Christ. Therefore, truth is a relationship.": "Pope",
  "I have no faith in human perfectability. I think that human exertion will have no appreciable effect upon humanity. Man is now only more active - not more happy - nor more wise, than he was 6000 years ago.": "Edgar",
  "Faith is an excitement and an enthusiasm: it is a condition of intellectual magnificence to which we must cling as to a treasure, and not squander on our way through life in the small coin of empty words, or in exact and priggish argument.": "George",
  "Faith and prayer are the vitamins of the soul man cannot live in health without them. ": "Mahalia",
  "Asking in faith requires honesty, effort, commitment, and persistence.": "David",
  "When your maturity is derived from circumstantial factors other than faith, your level of maturity would continue to fluctuate rather than being stable. This is why I am enabled to maintain a balance and stable approach to the challenges that come my way every day. I am not moved by what people say or do concerning my relationship with God.": "T.",

  "A library implies an act of faith.": "Victor",
  "Trust is a core currency of any relationship. Sometimes our need to control and micromanage everything erodes our confidence in ourselves and others.

  "Scoutcraft is a means through which the veriest hooligan can be brought to higher thought and to the elements of faith in God; and, coupled with the Scout's obligation to do a good turn every day, it gives the base of Duty to God and to Neighbour on which the parent or pastor can build with greater ease the form of belief that is desired.": "Robert",
  "People don't believe or understand that a community can lose hope. You can have a whole community where hopelessness is the norm, where folks don't have faith that things will get better because history and circumstances have proven over 30, 40, or 50 years that things don't get better.": "Geoffrey",
  "Doubt is not the opposite of faith it is one element of faith. ": "Paul",

  "I live and love in God's peculiar light.": "Michelangelo",
  "Stand straight, walk proud, have a little faith.": "Garth",
  "Faith itself is a horrible mechanism that stunts the growth of ideas. It also stunts the act of questioning, and it does this by pushing the idea that you have to have faith - and that nothing has to be proven.": "Joe",
  "I actually do not believe that there are any collisions between what I believe as a Christian, and what I know and have learned about as a scientist.

  "We all have our convictions formed by different things, and mine are informed by my faith, they're informed by the Word of God, and I found that to be an anchor for me, a compass and a guide for me. When people start bullying one another and calling each other names for those different convictions, then I think you get into problems.": "Kirk",
  "Faith consists in being vitally concerned with that ultimate reality to which I give the symbolical name of God. Whoever reflects earnestly on the meaning of life is on the verge of an act of faith.": "Paul",

  "Part of my driving desire as a pastor is to remove every obstacle except the cross that would keep people from coming to faith in Christ.": "Mark",
  "Faith is a continuum, and we each fall on that line where we may. By attempting to rigidly classify ethereal concepts like faith, we end up debating semantics to the point where we entirely miss the obvious - that is, that we are all trying to decipher life's big mysteries, and we're each following our own paths of enlightenment.": "Dan",
  "I am disturbed when I see the majority of so-called Christians having such little understanding of the real nature of the faith they profess. Faith is a subject of such importance that we should not ignore it because of the distractions or the hectic pace of our lives.": "William",
  "Let no rank puff up anyone for faith and love are paramount - the greatest blessings in the world. ": "Ignatius",
  "When we step out in faith and use the talents He's given us, we show that we trust God, that we believe He will bless our actions and cause us to succeed.": "Victoria",
  "I never was deeply interested in any object; I never prayed sincerely and earnestly for anything, but it came at some time - no matter how distant, in some way, in some shape, probably the last I should have devised, it came. And yet, I have always had so little faith. God forgive me.": "Adoniram",
  "People have to realize that just because you're a Christian, it doesn't mean that you're perfect, because every once in a while everyone stumbles. Living by faith is about when you do mess up, getting back up, brushing yourself off, and keep trying to improve where you mess up or where you have temptation.": "Tim",
  "Working with Roshni gives me lot of confidence. When I started SSN - in 1994, after a windfall gain from HCL-HP then - I was OK to do it alone. My brother, who was supposed to head it, passed away. We had a governing council to run it. That was a leap of faith, and we didn't know where we will get.": "Shiv",

  "God always takes the simplest way.": "Albert",
  "Reason is the enemy of faith.": "Martin",
  "The good news of suffering is that it brings us to the end of ourselves - a purpose it has certainly served in my life. It brings us to the place of honesty, which is the place of desperation, which is the place of faith, which is the place of freedom.": "Tullian",
  "It's not the tools that you have faith in - tools are just tools. They work, or they don't work. It's people you have faith in or not. Yeah, sure, I'm still optimistic I mean, I get pessimistic sometimes but not for long.": "Steve",
  "My first encounters with faith came about the time I was a Boy Scout, at about 14 or 15. I made the logical deduction that they operate the same way; I treated my faith like earning a merit badge, and everything about Christianity was about earning merit badges.": "Max",
  "I solemnly declare that this spiritual kingdom of faith will move forward with or without each of us individually. No unhallowed hand can stay the growth of the Church nor prevent fulfillment of its mission. Any of us can be left behind, drawn away by the seductive voices of secularism and materialism.": "James",
  "I think so many people tend to think of faith as blind adherence to a dogma or unquestioned surrender to an authority figure, and the result is losing self-respect and losing our own sense of what is true. And I don't think of faith in those terms at all.": "Sharon",
  "God never made a promise that was too good to be true.": "Dwight",

  "Life is only a long and bitter suicide, and faith alone can transform this suicide into a sacrifice.": "Franz",
  "The difficulties we face originate from one of three sources. Some are sent to us by the Lord to test our faith, others are the result of Satan's attacks, and still others are due to our own sinful choices.": "Charles",
  "I am satisfied that every man or woman who goes to the temple in a spirit of sincerity and faith leaves the house of the Lord a better man or woman.": "Gordon",
  "A witness, in the sense that I am using the word, is a man whose life and faith are so completely one that when the challenge comes to step out and testify for his faith, he does so, disregarding all risks, accepting all consequences.": "Whittaker",
  "I realized that my truest passion was for helping people change through faith in a higher power. That meant, for me, belonging to the church. Using my abilities to bring Christian doctrine to a postmodern world.": "James",

  "Evolution is unobservable. It's based on blind faith in a few dry bones and on unreliable dating systems in which the gullible trust. Kids should be allowed to make up their own minds about this issue, and not be censored to 'one side is all we will let you hear.'": "Ray",
  "With faith and obedience practiced long enough, the Holy Ghost becomes a constant companion, our natures change, and endurance becomes certain.": "Henry",
  "Embrace every opportunity of exercising kind feelings and doing good to others, especially to the household of faith.": "Adoniram",
  "During my first years in the Sierra, I was ever calling on everybody within reach to admire them, but I found no one half warm enough until Emerson came. I had read his essays, and felt sure that of all men he would best interpret the sayings of these noble mountains and trees. Nor was my faith weakened when I met him in Yosemite.": "John",
  "Fear is the denomination of the Old Testament belief is the denomination of the New. ": "Benjamin",

  "Liberty cannot be established without morality, nor morality without faith.": "Alexis",
  "I have an almost complete disregard of precedent, and a faith in the possibility of something better. It irritates me to be told how things have always been done. I defy the tyranny of precedent. I go for anything new that might improve the past.": "Clara",
  "Practice means to perform, over and over again in the face of all obstacles, some act of vision, of faith, of desire. Practice is a means of inviting the perfection desired.": "Martha",
  "In the evening of life we shall be judged on love, and not one of us is going to come off very well, and were it not for my absolute faith in the loving forgiveness of my Lord I could not call on him to come.": "Madeleine",
  "Back of every creation, supporting it like an arch, is faith. Enthusiasm is nothing: it comes and goes. But if one believes, then miracles occur.": "Henry",

  "Things can fall apart, or threaten to, for many reasons, and then there's got to be a leap of faith. Ultimately, when you're at the edge, you have to go forward or backward; if you go forward, you have to jump together.": "Yo-Yo",
  "Trust is not the same as faith. A friend is someone you trust. Putting faith in anyone is a mistake.": "Christopher",

  "There were periods of my life when a lot of people didn't believe in me. I still had faith in myself. I really had to ask myself life questions. Where do I see myself in five years? Create a ladder for yourself, and walk up the steps. Climb that ladder.": "Fergie",
  "Christian faith is... basically about love and being loved and reconciliation. These things are so important, they're foundational and they can transform individuals, families.": "Philip",
  "I think it is something that is so important, to be very aware of the direction in which the 21st century is going with all this blind faith in democracy. And by the way, I am not against democracy - I am against the blind faith that is being put in democracy.": "Alfonso",

  "Faith is personal if it's to be real.": "Bear",
  "And Jesus, the heart of the Christian faith is the wildest, most radical guy you'd ever come across.": "Bear",

  "The name 'Seventh-day Adventist' carries the true features of our faith in front and will convict the inquiring mind. Like an arrow from the Lord's quiver, it will wound the transgressors of God's law, and will lead to repentance toward God, and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ.": "Ellen",

This will engender a greater faith in our own future.": "Chiang",
  "We should know that faith is a gift of God, and that it may not be given to men, except it be graciously. Thus, indeed, all the good which we have is of God; and accordingly, when God rewardeth a good work of man, he crowneth his own gift.": "John",

  "Now I will say this to every sinner, though he should think himself to be the worst sinner who ever lived: cry to the Lord and seek Him while He may be found. A throne of grace is a place fitted for you. By simple faith, go to your Savior, for He is the throne of grace.": "Charles",
  "I don't know if my faith stems from what I'd call unconditional love, but the energy certainly feels boundless.": "Stacey",
  "Religious-liberty protections are one way of achieving civil peace even amid disagreement. The United States is a pluralistic society. To protect that pluralism and the rights of all Americans, of whatever faith they may practice, religious-liberty laws are good policy. Liberals committed to tolerance should embrace them.": "Edwin",
  "My faith teaches that life is sacred. That's why I personally oppose the death penalty. But I take my oath of office seriously, and I'll enforce the death penalty... because it's the law.": "Tim",
  "Wyoming is a special place: Where our farmers and ranchers rise before dawn and work until night to feed our nation.

  "I have faith in the judicial system.": "Clarence",
  "When I came to faith, I was on pro-choice boards, and I dropped off of those because you couldn't read the Bible and be pro-choice.": "Bob",
  "I partly know why I have not led a perfect life like other believers.

  "If I were dying, my last words would be: Have faith and pursue the unknown end.": "Oliver",
  "Faith is not a notion, but a real strong essential hunger, an attracting or magnetic desire of Christ, which as it proceeds from a seed of the divine nature in us, so it attracts and unites with its like.": "William",
  "I'm a believer in belief. Faith is something that works - it causes people to do things, it has results. It's an intangible, indefinable, very real thing. And it moves people, sometimes to atrocity. And sometimes to survival.": "Tommy",
  "What is faith? If you believe something because you have evidence for it, or rational argument, that is not faith. So faith seems to be believing something despite the absence of evidence or rational argument for it.": "Peter",
  "It's okay to have faith in something that you can't see or touch.": "Chad",
  "When music is allowed to take the place of devotion and prayer, it is a terrible curse. Young people assemble together to sing, and, although professed Christians, frequently dishonor God and their faith by their frivolous conversation and their choice of music.": "Ellen",
  "I like the detail work of telling a story in small pieces, as is done in movie-making, and also the long leap of faith needed to see a theatre performance through each night. Both require focus and self-discipline.": "Viggo",
  "Pakistan is heir to an intellectual tradition of which the illustrious exponent was the poet and philosopher Mohammad Iqbal. He saw the future course for Islamic societies in a synthesis between adherence to the faith and adjustment to the modern age.": "Benazir",
  "Sometimes you need faith and victory spoken over your life. Words have created power. When you receive them into your spirit, they can ignite seeds of increase on the inside.": "Joel",
  "Give someone who has faith in you a placebo and call it a hair growing pill, anti-nausea pill or whatever, and you will be amazed at how many respond to your therapy.": "Bernie",

  "Reason is our soul's left hand, faith her right.": "John",
  "Faith begins where Reason sinks exhausted.": "Albert",
  "I think faith is the small mustard seed of opportunities every day. For example, 'Am I going to love this person? Am I going to share my faith with this person?

  "The other day the President said, I know you've had some rough times, and I want to do something that will show the nation what faith that I have in you, in your maturity and sense of responsibility. He paused, then said, would you like a puppy?": "Dan",
  "Being outspoken about my faith isn't just something that I do it's who I am because my faith isn't just a little piece of my life. It is my life. It's not a question of whether I'm outspoken about it or not. I'm definitely not ashamed of it. ": "Tim",
  "If you desire to be pure, have firm faith, and slowly go on with your devotional practices without wasting your energy in useless scriptural discussions and arguments. Your little brain will otherwise be muddled.": "Ramakrishna",

  "If you have no faith, you've lost your battle.": "Bill",

  "My mother was truly my saving grace, because she would take me to church with her. I would see my mother smiling in the choir, and I wanted to know this God that made her so happy. If I had not had that faith in my life, I don't know where I would be right now.": "Tyler",
  "I'm really interested in mythology and folklore. I'm interested in moralities, why we're here, faith... all of these bigger questions that I think we can place in films that allow us to question and give us a safe place to feel. Those types of questions can pop up in all sorts of different types of films - drama, comedy, action movie.": "Brie",

  "There's stuff going on in the world right now, which you can't imagine why is this happening; it's crazy.

  "Faith is an island in the setting sun, But proof is the bottom line for everyone.": "Paul",
  "I don't think it's any coincidence that I lost my religious faith and 'manned up' in the same year. I was described somewhere as a lapsed Catholic, which is funny because I'm not going back! I want to achieve things rather than live life in an animalistic way.": "Jimmy",
  "We may not only find faith in God in our sorrow. We may also become faithful to Him in times of calm.": "Thomas",
  "I went into politics thinking that, if I made arguments in good faith, I'd get a hearing. It's a reasonable assumption, but it's wrong.

  "The sight of parents, children and grandparents all descending on a tented field to enjoy the pleasure of ideas and books renews my faith in humanity.": "Mariella",

  "God surrounded me with people of faith, people of strong faith, people of power, spiritual power, and I saw little miracles happen in their lives. By it happening in their lives, I started believing it could happen to me.": "Natalie",

  "The work of healing is not my work, but by faith, healing is done. The work of deliverance, great and mighty deliverance, is not my work but is my faith in Him. It is not the works of righteousness which I have done, but according to His grace. I am a product of His grace.": "T.",
  "Religious organizations exist to foster the interests of persons subscribing to the same religious faith. Not so of for-profit corporations. Workers who sustain the operations of those corporations commonly are not drawn from one religious community.": "Ruth",
  "I asked long ago,'What must I do to be saved?' The Scripture answered, 'Keep the commandments, believe, hope, love.'

  "Those who today always look for disciplinarian solutions, those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal 'security,' those who stubbornly try to recover a past that no longer exists - they have a static and inward-directed view of things. In this way, faith becomes an ideology among other ideologies.": "Pope",

  "As a former Commander, I gave an oath to defend the Constitution against all enemies foreign and domestic. As a state senator, I gave that same oath.

  "I had faith in the concept and the theory that all Americans are endowed with the right to a fair trial and I would be fairly judged and fairly tried.": "Wesley",
  "It's OK to be outspoken about your faith.": "Tim",
  "The infinite faith I have in people's ability to understand anything that makes sense has always been justified, finally, by their behavior.": "Alice",
  "I don't have faith in young people any more. I don't waste time trying to communicate with them.": "Vivienne",
  "Faith is a dynamic and ever-changing process, not some fixed body of truth that exists outside our world and our understanding. God's truth may be fixed and unchanging, but our comprehension of that truth will always be partial and flawed at best.": "Gene",
  "I wish everybody finds the serenity that good, strong faith brings.": "Ann",
  "I am totally convinced the Christian faith is the most coherent worldview around.": "Ravi",
  "I was a wife and mother, blameless in moral life, with a deep sense of duty and a proud self-respect; it was while I was this that doubt struck me, and while I was in the guarded circle of the home, with no dream of outside work or outside liberty, that I lost all faith in Christianity.": "Annie",
  "My faith in humanity leads me to believe that people are looking for something more elevating than the sordid details of the intimate aspects of one's personal life.": "Ginger",
  "Those who are preparing for the coming of Christ should be sober, and watch unto prayer, for our adversary, the Devil, goeth about like a roaring lion, seeking whom he may devour; whom we are to resist steadfast in the faith.": "Ellen",
  "We need a government, not politics. Because there's too much politics. Of course there should be debate. But there seems to be so much pettiness and not enough good faith. It is civilized to agree to disagree, and this idea is slowly disintegrating. The great statesmen of the past knew this, and I think it helps drive civilization.": "Daphne",
  "I'm always fascinated when people really fervently believe, because I have such a hard time believing anything. When people have real faith in something, it's fascinating to me. And the fact that so many people, in surveys, so many people say they do. It kind of blows my mind.": "Conor",
  "Let us take refuge from this world. You can do this in spirit, even if you are kept here in the body. You can at the same time be here and present to the Lord. Your soul must hold fast to him, you must follow after him in your thoughts, you must tread his ways by faith, not in outward show.": "Saint",
  "Faith is a really important part of my life and inspires me in all facets of my life, including my songwriting and my singing.": "Vusi",
  "First of all, you ask me if the God of Christians forgives one who doesn't believe and doesn't seek the faith. Premise that - and it's the fundamental thing - the mercy of God has no limits if one turns to him with a sincere and contrite heart; the question for one who doesn't believe in God lies in obeying one's conscience.": "Pope",
  "The opposite of faith is not doubt: It is certainty. It is madness. You can tell you have created God in your own image when it turns out that he or she hates all the same people you do.": "Anne",
  "You cannot let where you are today cause you to get stuck. I'm going to be my best right now. That's what faith is all about.": "Joel",
  "I'm just the messenger here. I'm just another representative of my faith, so to speak.": "Stephen",
  "Our Heavenly Father loves us. He sent His Only Begotten Son to be our Savior. He knew that in mortality we would be in grave danger, the worst of it from the temptations of a terrible adversary. That is one of the reasons why the Savior has provided priesthood keys so that those with ears to hear and faith to obey could go to places of safety.": "Henry",
  "Let me say that I consider myself a deep believer in the reality of God. I might define God quite differently from the way some people in the Christian faith would do so, but I do not doubt the reality of that experience.": "John",
  "I'm a great mother because of my intentions on being a great mother I'm a good friend because I'm loyal I'm a good daughter because I've hopefully made my mother proud I'm a great human being because I accept that there's a spiritual being underneath it all. I've always been a woman of faith. ": "Lauren",
  "The Almighty has plans for us to make a place so we can go on and make a difference. It all has to do with my faith; I am deeply religious. It goes back to my roots, to my mom and my dad.": "Dikembe",
  "Most Christians would not recognize Mormonism as part of the Christian faith.": "Franklin",
  "I was 22 years old when I asked Christ to come into my heart. You cannot be born a Christian you can only be converted. And that is by putting your faith and trust in Christ. ": "Franklin",
  "My characters tend to be more dynamic because they're reaching that point in their lives where their old way of being is breaking down. They're conflicted by the idea that they don't know what's next. You could call it Kierkegaard's leap of faith, when you get tired of sort of reinventing yourself on a very superficial level.": "Chuck",
  "When I turned about 14, I developed a friendship with this guy whose mom was the secretary to Ernest Angley, the faith healer, who's very popular in the Midwest. He had a television show, and he was sort of like Liberace mixed with Jerry Falwell - very glitzy, very high-tech.": "Marilyn",
  "I haven't looked at marriage in the conventional sense, as far as settling down. I look at it as putting faith in another person, which has always been hard for me to do.": "Marilyn",
  "To receive all of the promised blessings, we must accept the gospel in faith and in full. However, this certain faith does not usually come all at once. We learn spiritually line upon line and precept upon precept.": "James",
  "I believe transparency in government is key to restoring our nation's faith in its elected leaders.": "Kirsten",
  "If we are too friendly to nice, decent bishops, we run the risk of buying into the fiction that there's something virtuous about believing things because of faith rather than because of evidence. We run the risk of betraying scientific enlightenment.": "Richard",
  "The very idea that you could have separation between mosque and state from Islam's perspective is the imposition on them of Christian practice. Islam doesn't really have a place for state. They are a universalistic faith like Christianity, but they think there is no country that bounds Islam.": "Stanley",
  "What the world needs today more than anything else is an implicit faith in God, our Father, and in Jesus Christ, His Son, as the Redeemer of the world.": "Heber",
  "The Resurrection is at the core of our beliefs as Christians. Without it, our faith is meaningless.": "Joseph"
