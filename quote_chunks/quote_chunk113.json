  "We get information in the mail, the regular postal mail, encrypted or not, vet it like a regular news organization, format it - which is sometimes something that's quite hard to do, when you're talking about giant databases of information - release it to the public and then defend ourselves against the inevitable legal and political attacks.": "Julian",

  "A free and open Internet should not have to be weighed down by legal challenges - its dynamism is essential to our economy.": "Anna",

  "Tori's my legal name. My niece and nephews, they all call me Aunt Ellen, because I went by my middle name years ago, before I turned 18.": "Tori",
  "I'm for the DREAM Act. It makes so much sense. Following the implementation of the DREAM Act, we'll have a case study we can point to where we can say that we provided a path to citizenship or legal involvement in the community for these young immigrants, and the sky didn't fall.": "Beto",
  "Learn to invest in investments where you can achieve an honest, legal advantage over other investors. When it comes to investing, why play on a level field?": "Robert",
  "The Elephantine papyri - written as some of the books of the Bible are being written - is true social and legal documentation, and to historians overwhelmingly powerful and moving, even when ostensibly about trivial things.": "Simon",
  "Don't get me wrong: I can and do waste time on the Internet with the best of them, but in some respects, I am an embarrassingly analog guy. I am not on Facebook. I write whole books on yellow legal pads. I do not own a cell phone.": "Jonathan",
  "The most interesting legal philosophy is German, so naturally I went to Germany, particularly to Berlin, quite a bit.": "Philip",
  "I researched children's rights, divorce law, and parental kidnapping. Millions of children and parents are touched by the inadequacy of the legal system to deal with the human heart.": "Amity",
  "I've worked since it was basically legal to work. I was a waitress on and off for eight years. I worked at Sears; I worked at Abercrombie folding clothes. My dad really instilled good money management habits, and I've saved 10 percent of my paycheck, every paycheck, since I was 15.": "Rosanna",
  "'Network neutrality' is sometimes called 'Internet freedom' or 'Internet openness' and is a legal principle that would forbid cable and phone companies like AT&T, Verizon, and Comcast from blocking some websites or providing special priority to others.": "Marvin",

  "We have a legal and moral obligation to rid our world of nuclear tests and nuclear weapons.": "Ban",
  "Games of chance often involve some amount of skill; this does not make them legal. Good poker players often beat novices. But poker is still gambling, and running a poker room - or online casino - is illegal in New York.": "Eric",
  "I remember being upset because I was finally legal to drink in Canada, and I decided to throw that all away and move to America, where I had to wait another two years. I came here to do improv and to try to join the Groundlings.": "Ryan",
  "While writing, saying, and doing much, Mr. Trump is apologizing for his past sins. He's walking away from supporting abortion, hurling insults and more.

  "In the U.S., you even lose legal rights if you store your data in a company's machines instead of your own.

They may not even have to give the company a search warrant.": "Richard",
  "I don't have an issue with whether - from a legal standpoint, with whether or not government can impose the ultimate punishment on people. We do it in capital cases. Police officers shoot fleeing felons.": "Trey",
  "Our church has been legal since late 1960s. I've been involved since 1972. I was ordained in 1975.": "Sally",
  "Years ago, during a John Grisham phase, I tried to pinpoint exactly why I found Grisham's often predictable legal thrillers quite so comforting. The best answer I could come up with was the frequency with which Grisham tells us that his lead characters are sipping coffee. When it comes to food and drink, predictability can console.": "Bee",
  "Strictly speaking, my interest is not in legal rights for animals but in a change of heart towards animals.": "J.",
  "The existing legal constitution is nothing but the product of a revolution. Revolution is the act of political creation in the history of classes, while constitutional legislation is the expression of the continual political vegetation of a society.": "Rosa",

  "If they lose their legal basis for owning a .cn domain, google.cn would cease to exist, or if it continued to exist, it would be illegal, and doing anything blatantly illegal in China puts their employees at serious risk.": "Rebecca",
  "Yahoo! had a choice. It chose to provide an e-mail service hosted on servers based inside China, making itself subject to Chinese legal jurisdiction. It didn't have to do that. It could have provided a service hosted offshore only.": "Rebecca",
  "Thanks to the Internet in general and social media in particular, the Chinese people now have a mechanism to hold authorities accountable for wrongdoing - at least sometimes - without any actual political or legal reforms having taken place. Major political power struggles and scandals are no longer kept within elite circles.": "Rebecca",
  "There isn't much question that the person who obtained the WikiLeaks cables from a classified U.S. government network broke U.S. law and should expect to face the consequences. The legal rights of a website that publishes material acquired from that person, however, are much more controversial.": "Rebecca",
  "I write on big yellow legal pads - ideas in outline form when I'm doing stand-up and stuff. It's vivid that way. I can't type it into an iPad - I think that would put a filter into the process.": "Robin",
  "If there are people who act outside the law, then the state must use legal means to impose law in the interests of majority. That's the way it's done in the U.S., and that's the way it's done in Russia.": "Vladimir",
  "Many foreclosed homes are neglected or abandoned, as legal proceedings or other factors delay their resale. Deteriorating or vacant properties can, in turn, directly affect the quality of life in a neighborhood, for example, by leading to increases in vandalism or crime.": "Ben",

  "If eviction has these massive consequences that we all pay for, a very smart use of public funds would be to invest in legal services for folks facing eviction.": "Matthew",
  "There is a deep connection, when we're talking about certain market forces and a legal structure that inhibits low or moderate income families from getting ahead. Eviction is part of a business model at the bottom of the market.": "Matthew",
  "National data on evictions aren't collected, although national data on foreclosures are. And so if anyone wants to, kind of, get to know any statistical research about evictions, they have to really dig in the annals of legal records.": "Matthew",
  "We should make it as easy as possible to be able to get a legal work visa - not citizenship, not a green card. Just a work visa, with a background check and a Social Security card so that applicable taxes would get paid.": "Gary",
  "Some officials overseeing local water systems have tried to go above and beyond what is legally required. But they have encountered resistance, sometimes from the very residents they are trying to protect, who say that if their water is legal, it must be safe.": "Charles",

  "My U.N. five-point plan focuses on preventing proliferation, strengthening the legal regime, and ensuring nuclear safety and security - an effort that was given good momentum by the Nuclear Security Summit held in Seoul earlier this year.

  "We're told that to be fly, you gotta have a fly car, the rims on your wheels, the fly jewels, and that to work a regular job and make legal money is uncool.": "Missy",
  "There's a security, a validity of knowing that it's legal. It's hard to put into words. It's just a feeling, I guess - something about saying vows in front of the people around you who love and support you.": "Matt",
  "We believe that government in Britain is there to protect people from terrorism and from the worst criminality, but never at the expense of our civil liberties and the basic tenets of our legal system.": "Charles",
  "Against the wishes of my family, I gave up my legal career, and I volunteered for the Army. I became an infantryman. I went to Iraq and Afghanistan.": "Tom",
  "We should have a path to legal status for the 12 million people that are here illegally. It means, come out from the shadows, pay a fine, earn legal status by working, by paying taxes, learning English. Not committing crimes and earn legal status where you're not cutting in front of the line for people that are patiently waiting outside.": "Jeb",
  "Taiwan gives a lot of foreign aid to Costa Rica, so it looks like they are basically buying the right to fish, even though it's not legal.": "Paul",
  "In 1987, I had my first opportunity to provide 'advice and consent' on a Supreme Court nominee. At that time, I stated that the qualifications essential for evaluating a nominee for the bench included 'integrity, character, legal competence and ability, experience, and philosophy and judicial temperament.' On that test, Elena Kagan fails.": "John",
  "On the issue of the gay marriage, I believe if people want to have private ceremonies, that's fine. I do not believe that gay marriages should be legal.": "John",
  "Botswana had three successive good presidents who served their legal terms, who did well for their countries - three, not one.": "Mo",
  "I say the law should be blind to race, gender and sexual orientation, just as it claims to be blind to wealth and power. There should be no specially protected groups of any kind, except for children, the severely disabled and the elderly, whose physical frailty demands society's care.": "Camille",
  "In Texas, it's legal for a kid to be in a bar with your parents.": "Maren",
  "I think the only way to behave is as if nothing is private. And then fight to make what you care about legal and acceptable.": "Douglas",
  "I have been surrounded by some of the smartest, brightest, most caring lawyers, by agents who are willing to risk their lives for others, by support staff that are willing to work as hard as they can.": "Janet",
  "I think, clearly, where you have a situation in which the Solicitor General tells me, 'I cannot in good faith argue a certainly legal position,' and if the president told us to argue that position, we would have to tell him, 'No, we can't do that, Mr. President.'": "Janet",
  "The military tribunals currently underway at Guantanamo Bay create a clear legal process, as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court in Hamdi v. Rumsfeld, for adjudicating the cases of these terrorists, when possible. Those efforts would be severely undercut by moving the detainees to the United States.": "Mike",

  "Compromise is the best and cheapest lawyer.": "Robert",
  "Discerning the legal difference between what WikiLeaks did and what news organizations do is difficult and would set a terrible precedent.": "George",
  "If a president can enforce a part of a law and delay a part of a law, then does he have a power to not enforce any law he so chooses? If he can allow illegal aliens to freely run across our border, can he force legal citizens out of the country? Where would be the end of his power?": "Marsha",
  "Just as Josef K, the protagonist of Kafka's 'The Trial,' awoke one day to discover that he had become part of some unfathomable legal carnival, we, too are frequently waking to discover that the rules of the digital game have once again profoundly changed.": "Evgeny",
  "What can you do if they have slapped you with a legal notice? You have to reply. For all you know, they have taken you to jail or something.": "Kangana",
  "Catholicism is a wide tent in terms of political and legal positions. We could have nine Catholics on the Supreme Court and a great deal of diversity toward the law.": "Cass",
  "The process of getting regulations right is described publicly as far more political than in fact it is. It's essentially a legal and technical enterprise.": "Cass",
  "I contend the state ought to do its thing and provide legal rights for all couples who want to be joined together for life. The church should bless unions that it sees fit to bless, and they should be called marriages.": "Tony",
  "I propose that the government should get out of the business of marrying people and, instead, only give legal status to civil unions.": "Tony",
  "In legal language, a covenant generally denotes an agreement between two or more parties. But in a religious context, a covenant is much more significant. It is a sacred promise with God. He fixes the terms.": "Russell",
  "In high school - that's when I first fell in love with his music and his voice. 'Blonde on Blonde' above everything. I vaguely remember 'Desire' coming out. I definitely remember 'Street Legal' and 'Slow Train Coming.' The first time I saw Dylan was on that tour: '79 in L.A.": "Todd",
  "There's been so much corruption and so much cronyism in the taxi industry and so much regulatory capture, that if you ask for permission upfront for something that's already legal, you'll never get it.": "Travis",
  "I mean, in some cases with libel laws, you know, they can write things about people who have no course of action, because they can't afford to take legal action against them.": "Elton",
  "My feminism, as intended by me, extends to empowering women to make legal choices, not to judge the legal choices they make. My fight is for rights.": "Maajid",
  "In today's Britain, the weakest among us are often assumed to be minority communities. In fact, the weakest are those minorities-within-minorities for whom the legal right to exit from their communities' constraints amounts to nothing before the enforcement of cultural and religious shaming.": "Maajid",
  "These endless legal challenges that define elections in New York are a joke in this country, and they are the reason why it is so expensive, or one of the reasons, it's so expensive to run here and why so many people decide not to run.": "Michael",
  "We have to get control of our borders. You can only do that if you make companies obey the law and not hire undocumented or illegals. They can only do that is if they have a Social Security Card that has biometrics so they know whether the person is legal or not.": "Michael",
  "When officers' actions violate their duty, justice should be served in accordance with our legal system.": "Thom",

  "Because it started as an offshoot of al Qaeda in Iraq, ISIL has long been subject to U.N. sanctions, and all countries have a legal obligation to freeze its assets and prohibit its business dealings. But countries around the world need to do more to make these sanctions work.": "Samantha",
  "Focus on your product. A lot of people focus on the name of their brand or the legal aspects, but it's more important to create your product. It's why people join. It's your vision. Without your product, nothing is going to happen.": "Payal",
  "Russia has gone way beyond its legal powers to use bases in the Crimea.": "Jeremy",
  "Hillary Clinton is in political trouble and perhaps even legal trouble over her use of private e-mail accounts and bypassing government-issued accounts containing substantial amounts of information that belongs to the federal government. But ultimately, I don't think this latest controversy will hurt her presidential ambitions.": "Bob",
  "Going through a long legal battle is not what you sign up for as a fighter.": "Andre",
  "I have a lot of friends who, especially in Tennessee, were looking forward to getting married who wanted to wait until it was legal in the state that they live in to get married.": "Trisha",
  "I broke into the ranks of computing in the early 1980s, when women were just starting to poke their shoulder pads through crowds of men. There was no legal protection against 'hostile environments for women.'": "Ellen",

  "As self-driving cars become more common, there will be a flood of new legal questions.": "Adam",
  "My favourite authors are John Grisham and Jeffrey Archer. Grisham rapidly established himself and now completely owns the legal space of fiction writing, something I want to do in financial space. I like Archer because he keeps his readers engaged: every chapter is a page turner, and he keeps his writing simple.": "Ravi",
  "People travel overseas to do things overseas that aren't legal in Ireland all the time. You know, are we going to stop people going to Las Vegas? Are we going to stop people going to Amsterdam? There are things that are illegal in Ireland, and we don't prevent people from travelling overseas to avail of them.": "Leo",
  "When I was fighting, I would look to excite the crowds with a bolo punch or something taunting. Looking back, they were legal - but not sportsmanlike. I don't recommend another boxer try them. But we looked more to make the robot fights dramatic first and realistic second.": "Sugar",
  "Russia has every reason to dispose of its nuclear arsenal... to suit its interests and international legal obligations.": "Sergei",
  "Nobody was like, 'Kimberly, we're going to let you anchor general news or host a show or do any of that.' I at first started out doing legal analysis, but I had to make the case to my bosses... give me a shot, give me a chance, and I was able to do that: say, 'Let me fill in. Let me show you my range. Nothing to lose here - it's the holidays.'": "Kimberly",
  "If I was applying for a legal position, I would highlight my experience working for the San Francisco-L.A. DA's office, and I would mention some of the high-profile cases I did, but if I was looking for another television job, I would gloss over that, and I'd mention the highlight reel of what I did in television.": "Kimberly",
  "Sure, our legal system has its flaws, but it is the best legal system in the world.": "Kimberly",
  "Sport is increasingly played according to the tune, and rules, of those with the biggest bucks, whether their practices be legal or illegal.": "Martin",

  "It is not monogamy when there is one legal wife, and mistresses out of sight.": "Annie",
  "We should all have the legal right to purchase health insurance from any insurance company in any state, and we should be able use that insurance wherever we live. Health insurance should be portable.": "John",
  "I spent so many years in terror of 'making it legal' because the expression rang all too true - the wedding ritual struck me as nothing but a flowery front for the fulfilment of countless, tedious contracts and obligations.": "Lynn",
  "By incentivizing Wall Street players to sniff out inefficient or corrupt companies and bet against them, short-selling acts as a sort of policing system; legal short-sellers have been instrumental in helping expose firms like Enron and WorldCom.": "Matt",
  "The settlers, as we know, are the only people in Israel who take the Left seriously. When you read the settlers' publications, you think that the leftists are everywhere: The leftists infiltrate the government, the leftists run the Defense Ministry, the leftists dominate the legal establishment, and the leftists control the media, of course.": "Yair",
  "Slavery, if it can be legalized at all, can be legalized only by positive legislation. Natural law gives it no aid. Custom imparts to it no legal sanction.": "Lysander",
  "It cannot be said that the Constitution formed 'the people of the United States,' for all time, into a corporation. It does not speak of 'the people' as a corporation, but as individuals. A corporation does not describe itself as 'we,' nor as 'people,' nor as 'ourselves.' Nor does a corporation, in legal language, have any 'posterity.'": "Lysander",
  "The mental capacity of a person to make reasonable contracts, is the only criterion, by which to determine his legal capacity to make obligatory contracts. And his mental capacity to make reasonable contracts is certainly not to be determined by the fact that he is, or is not, twenty-one years of age.": "Lysander",
  "If you see how carefully I prepare for any kind of walk, legal or illegal, small or big, you will see that, actually, I narrow the unknown to virtually nothing. And that's when I am ready to walk on the wire.": "Philippe",

  "Legal immigration is the primary source of low-wage immigration into the United States.": "Jeff",
  "Look at liberty's greatest historic advances: ending slavery. Giving women the vote. Outlawing legal segregation. Each and every time, the people at the forefront of advancing those reforms - often putting their lives on the line - called themselves liberals.": "Rick",
  "If a woman chooses to have an abortion, it is legal to do that in this country, but I don't think taxpayers should be put in a position to have to pay for those abortions.": "John",

  "We have a very long legal system with the European Union, and we're English speaking.": "Enda",
  "One of the challenges for lawyers can be explaining, first of all, what the legal issue is and, second, its significance. And both of those are important.": "Ken",

  "In America, to be ID'd - sorted, tagged, and permanently filed - is to lose a bit of one's soul. To die a little. This sounds like a subtle, poetic notion. It's not. In American legal and cultural tradition, one essential privilege of citizenship is not having to prove it on demand.": "Walter",
  "I look forward to taking on issues regarding the Constitution, intellectual property, terrorism, and other legal and regulatory reforms.": "Ron",

  "If we build the legal immigration system better, then they come here, and we'll have a whole lot less illegal immigration.": "Bill",

  "The Myth of Male Power dealt much more with the political issues, the legal issues, sexual harassment, date rape, women who kill, and those issues were very much more interfaced with the agendas of feminism.": "Warren",
  "When the FDA announced its intentions to join other countries and ban quinolone use on U.S. chicken farms, the drug manufacturer Bayer initiated legal action that successfully delayed the process for five years.": "Michael",
  "One of the things I believe strongly in is developing institutions - legal, press, bureaucracies, academies - that are rooted in the pursuit of impartial truth. That aren't simply just bent to partisan ends or are corrupted for the powerful or for other ulterior motives.": "David",
  "This pro-choice issue is a legal issue that should be decided by the courts.": "Michael",
  "I mentioned it yesterday: I'm one of these people that - I don't - like, on the abortion issue, it's not something that - I'm very uncomfortable talking about it. I'm not gonna kid you. It's a very uncomfortable thing. I think that it's a legal issue. Definitely a legal issue. It's been decided upon by our Supreme Court.": "Michael",
  "In the United States, female fisticuffs were marginalized, first as erotic vaudeville in the 19th century and later as serious competition developed in the first half of the 20th. Legal wars waged by boxers in the 1960s and '70s won women the right to compete professionally nationwide.": "Katherine",
  "We need to stop illegal immigration totally and reduce legal immigration and end the diversity visas policy pushed hard by President Clinton and allowing many persons from the Middle East to come to this country.": "Virgil",
  "One: balance the budget now, not later. Two: Get Americans jobs by ending illegal immigration and making legal immigration harder. Lastly: Impose term limits.": "Virgil",
  "The reality is for 50 years in this country, federal law has required people that are illegal - or that are immigrants - or that are legal immigrants to this country to carry documentation to that effect. And that has been the law for 50 years.": "Trent",
  "I think there's no problem getting through the House a pathway to legal status. A pathway to citizenship is going to be tougher, but I think it is potentially doable, if we can show the American people that the border is secure.": "Blake",
  "I have a different approach. I don't file lawsuits because I really don't care.": "Nicole",
  "The simplest formula for the new conception of morality, which is beginning to be opposed to the moral dogma still esteemed by all society, but especially by the women, might be summed up in these words: Love is moral even without legal marriage, but marriage is immoral without love.": "Ellen",
  "When I'm sitting at the desk not being able to write line one, it's silence and despair! It's not so easy to put the pen to the legal pad or type the first sentence on the computer screen.": "Erica",
  "I think 'The Act of Killing' forced people to look at the problem, but the problem is actually a state run by thugs, or a shadow state, a part of the state that's run by thugs, and a military that enjoys complete legal - not just impunity, but immunity.": "Joshua",
  "Gay marriage is the last bastion of, to me... as a legal, ceremonial, sentimental and religious side, it's one of the last steps. Retaining your job being one of the earlier steps, like, not getting kicked out of your job because you're gay.": "Gus",
  "We have allowed a situation to develop in which it is legal for a multibillion dollar industry to own, wholly and in perpetuity, the intimate and personal details of children.": "Beeban",
  "Again, in Wag the Dog, war has to be declared by an act of congress. But if you go to war, you don't have to declare war. You're just at war and we did that, which is not legal.": "Val",
  "I know how easy it is for one to stay well within moral, ethical, and legal bounds through the skillful use of words - and to thereby spin, sidestep, circumvent, or bend a truth completely out of shape. To that extent, we are all liars on numerous occasions.": "Sidney",
  "Of all the questions I get asked as an undocumented immigrant in the United States, there are two - asked in various permutations via email, social media or in person - that chill me to the bone: 'Why don't you just make yourself legal?' And: 'Why don't you get in the back of the line?'": "Jose",
  "Britain's legal structure is basically the same as in feudal times: laws are written for the elite.": "Heather",
  "It is already clear that, because of advances in technology, drones are going to play an increased role in warfare in the years ahead. It is therefore vital that the legal frameworks governing their use are robust and internationally recognised.": "Douglas",
  "I don't believe in amnesty... What I have proposed is that we would come forth with a program that allows individuals to come forward and to plead guilty... They would have to pay a fine they would have to go through a background check - some say learn English - and they would get learned legal status. ": "Chris",
  "A new book by 'New York Times' reporter Charlie Savage, 'Power Wars,' suggests that there has been little substantive difference between George W.

  "I love immigrants. Legal, illegal - they're not to be despised.": "Mario",
  "I think we will have full marriage rights in Colorado. But in 1992, there was a very hateful Amendment 2 that basically made it legal for any institution to deny gays and lesbians access, whether it's hospitals or restaurants or employment. Anybody could fire you or not let you in a restaurant because you were gay.": "Martina",
  "I don't even talk about whether or not racial profiling is legal. I just don't think racial profiling is a particularly good law enforcement tool.": "Eric",
  "Gay and lesbian people have families, and their families should have legal protection, whether by marriage or civil union.": "Coretta",
  "We want Israel as a democratic and Jewish state. So you have to maintain a Jewish majority, and you want to do that by legal means, by democratic means.": "Benjamin",
  "I had to understand the whole bounty hunting thing, because we don't have that in Venezuela. Nothing similar at all, at least not legal.": "Edgar",
  "The Grameen Bank Ordinance with amendments up to 2008 is a beautiful legal structure for the fulfillment of the ideals and objectives of the bank. Any change in this structure will be devastating for the bank.": "Muhammad",

  "I do not believe abortion should be legal.": "Herman",
  "I chose law because writing was involved. I didn't realize how boring legal writing was, but I even learned to love that.": "Marcia",
  "State-sanctioned marriage is a civil contract, period. A contract is not a judgment of moral value. It is a legal agreement between two parties that testifies to a meeting of minds between those consenting entities. It is not a religious act or rite and so has nothing to do with Adam and Eve or Steve or even Harvey.": "Harvey",
  "In my role as Wikileaks editor, I've been involved in fighting off many legal attacks. To do that, and keep our sources safe, we have had to spread assets, encrypt everything, and move telecommunications and people around the world to activate protective laws in different national jurisdictions.": "Julian",
  "My first winner was on Legal Steps, in Ireland, at Thurles, in March 1992. I rode for Jim Bolger, and his stable jockey was Christy Roche.": "Tony",

  "Allowing for endless legal challenges or partisan political discussions is not the proper way to handle an issue that affects the entire scope of the environment and the economy.": "Gene",

  "In Psalm 72, Solomon prays for power and fame but he says the purpose of influence is to speak up for others and one is the immigrant. He doesn't delineate between legal and illegal.": "Rick",
  "Defining marriage is a power that should be left to the states. Moreover, no state should be forced to recognize a marriage that is not within its own laws, Constitution, and legal precedents.": "John",
  "Americans have grown a great deal more realistic about lawyers and the law. I think that's all for the good. A lot of people will say to you these days, 'If you are looking for justice, don't go to a courtroom.' That's just a more realistic perspective on what happens in the legal process.": "Scott",
  "People talk of me as being the inventor of the legal thriller.": "Scott",
  "Though I had come into the world on 16 November 1922, my official documents show that I was born two days later, on the 18th. It was thanks to this petty fraud that my family escaped from paying the fine for not having registered my birth at the proper legal time.": "Jose",
  "I'll occasionally go and do an honor like the Mexican-American Legal Defense Fund because it raises money for a very worthy organization.": "Linda",

  "I admit my view of the world is colored by my legal and business experiences at Liberty.": "Jerry",
  "There is international criminal organizations penetrating our southern based borders, and we need to do something about it. Secure the border, enforce the law, no amnesty, and go forward with the legal immigration system that gives priority to American working families and wages.": "Scott",
  "When I became an entrepreneur, I had the knowledge to develop and manage budgets, market products and review legal contracts.": "Vivek",
  "It is hard to see Judge Roberts as a judicial activist who would place ideological purity or a particular agenda above or ahead the need for thoughtful legal reasoning.": "Ron",
  "When I was 27 years old, I organized legal aid clinics to help low-income seniors. It was a life-altering experience.": "Ron",
  "The acid test of any legal system is not the greatness or the grandeur of its ideal concepts, but whether, in fact, it is able to produce order and justice.": "Lee",
  "My parents realized the dangers of raising a daughter in a social, political, and legal climate that was growing increasingly oppressive toward women and girls. Although they fled to London when I was just three weeks old, the challenges facing women's rights in Iran became ingrained in my social consciousness.": "Nazanin",
  "I've rung my bells so many times, especially back in the day when chair shots to the head were legal. My goodness, I took so many of those.": "Jeff",

  "These are people who haven't gone through the legal means to becoming citizens like our forefathers did. They want all the benefits but none of the responsibilities.": "Matt",
  "Relying on the face might be human nature - even babies prefer to look at attractive people. But, of course, judging someone based on the geometry of his features is, from a moral and legal standpoint, no better than judging him based on the color of his skin.": "Paul",
  "When I was a prosecutor in Kansas City, my job was to fight for justice and safety for all citizens in my community. Equal access to justice under the law is an American value embedded in the fabric of our legal and political system - the idea that anybody, powerful or not, can have their day in court.": "Claire",
  "Before swearing in new citizens, immigration officials check to make sure prospective citizens weren't on voter rolls or voted before achieving legal citizenship. A citizenship petition can be denied if they were.": "Kate",
  "That's one thing I don't think people consider nowadays. They want to believe in the importance of marriage, boil it down to just a signature on a legal document. But that's exactly what it is. If not, why not just get married without one?": "Ariel",
  "I do believe that people hire immigrants, legal and illegal immigrants, to do certain jobs that maybe possibly could go to American citizens, and that's unfortunate. If they're here legally, I think it's OK. If they're here illegally, then they ought not be taking jobs from American citizens.": "Jan",

  "The legal system in Afghanistan is very immature and porous.": "Lindsey",
  "Like all other law-abiding Americans, I fully support legal immigration.": "Ted",
  "Every generation gets the Constitution that it deserves. As the central preoccupations of an era make their way into the legal system, the Supreme Court eventually weighs in, and nine lawyers in robes become oracles of our national identity.": "Noah",

  "For years, the Bush Administration eviscerated all the military and legal structures that were designed to separate the innocent from the guilty in the 'Global War on Terror.'": "Alex",
  "I believe wholeheartedly in marriage. I don't exclusively mean a marriage with a legal contract, but any relationship that constitutes a marriage because of the quality of their relationship.": "Helen",
  "The evolution of the plaza always came from the idea of just a really good place to ride a skateboard that you could ride at anytime, and that's what the foundation always stands for - being a place that's free, open and legal... for those that are technical, to do really hard stuff, and for those who are learning, to just have fun.": "Rob",
  "Opponents of legal birth control, including abortion, have tried for decades to play the race card, saying that legal abortion is racist. What they ignore is that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. accepted the Margaret Sanger Award from Planned Parenthood in 1966.": "Karen",
  "I really am not going to get involved in a discussion about the legal position of the Iraq war. I am not the person to do that because I am not sufficiently impartial as a lawyer about this, because it's a matter that is of interest to the person that I am closest to in the world.": "Cherie",
  "If I want to make political decisions, I should stand for election. If I want to do something in the legal field, that's different; that is my - they are my qualifications, but you know, the politicians are the ones who stand up there and are answerable to the people.": "Cherie",

  "When then-New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer sued me in 2003 over my stewardship as a director of the New York Stock Exchange, the NYSE's legal expenses were more than $100 million, which made it perhaps the priciest litigation in the state's history.": "Kenneth",
  "One of the reasons Elton and I entered into our partnership - the first day it became legal in Britain to do so - is that we felt it was an opportunity to protect ourselves with official recognition of our relationship.": "David",
  "While Texas women have the right to safe, legal abortion, in reality there are already very few facilities in Texas to provide this essential care. In 2008, 92 percent of Texas counties had no abortion provider.": "Wendy",
  "A lot of things that we cannot buy and sell in markets used to be totally legal objects of market exchange - human beings when we had slavery, child labour, human organs, and so on. So there is no economic theory that actually says that you shouldn't have slavery or child labour because all these are political, ethical judgments.": "Ha-Joon",
  "You know, my first three or four drafts, you can see, are on legal pads in long hand. And then I go to a typewriter, and I know everybody's switching to a computer. And I'm sort of laughed at.": "Robert",
  "So many times I've heard people say that the right to marry for gay and lesbian couples won't really change anything other than some legal and financial stuff. It's a dumb argument: those legal and financial effects matter.": "Alice",
  "The American legal industry is a medieval guild in which the prosecutors, bar, and bench join hands to ensure that legal invoices are paid, no matter how excessive.": "Conrad",
  "In the US, you even lose legal rights if you store your data in a company's machines instead of your own. The police need to present you with a search warrant to get your data from you; but if they are stored in a company's server, the police can get it without showing you anything.": "Richard",
  "Frivolous lawsuits are booming in this county. The U.S. has more costs of litigation per person than any other industrialized nation in the world, and it is crippling our economy.": "Jack",

  "A jury is composed of twelve men of average ignorance.": "Herbert",
  "He is no lawyer who cannot take two sides.": "Charles",
  "I think a moratorium probably is legal, and we should probably for a short period of time impose a moratorium so that we don't permit any additional landfill permits for the time being, so we don't exacerbate the problem.": "Ed",

  "Misery is the company of lawsuits.": "Francois",
  "One thing I know from personal experience, judges hate it when parties talk publicly about their cases. There are a lot of things about our criminal legal system that need to be changed, and this is just one of them. Prosecutors know how to play the press. Most defendants don't.": "Michael",
  "The increasing legal pressure against archives has created anxieties among researchers, librarians, and journalists. They cite the need to protect sources who wish to make a record for posterity; procuring documents and interviews from those sources will be difficult if the fruits are only one subpoena away from disclosure.": "Jonathan",

  "As a factual matter, as in countries all over the world, technology and business practices have been running faster than legal responses and developments.": "Miriam",
  "What I'll say is that Cuban-Americans don't have to deal with the same immigration issues as other nationalities because of the 'wet feet, dry feet' policy. For Cubans, one year after you touch United States territory, you can become a legal resident.": "Jorge",

  "I never thought I would live long enough to see the legal profession change to the extent it has.": "Constance",
  "If the court strikes down the Defense of Marriage Act, is that a 'liberal' result enabling gay couples married in states where gay marriage is legal to enjoy the same economic advantages that federal laws now grant to straight couples? Or is it a 'conservative' ruling, limiting the federal government's ability to override state power?": "Jeff",
  "King consciously steered away from legal claims and instead relied on civil disobedience.": "Constance",
  "In high school, I discovered myself. I was interested in race relations and the legal profession. I read about Lincoln and that he believed the law to be the most difficult of professions.": "Constance",

  "Just as TurboTax simplified much of the tax process, so has the colossally scary legal process been reduced to a kinder, gentler series of mouse clicks and 'Continue' buttons by LegalZoom, the online leader that has become so prominent in its market that it's practically a generic.": "Lynda",
  "They seem to have forgotten that, and are back saying the only purpose of P2P networks is for illegal trading of owned goods. We claim part of the reason for P2P is for legal trading of what ought to be in public domain. And what is in public domain in many cases.": "John",
  "The 'Total Information Awareness' project is truly diabolical - mostly because of the legal changes which have made it possible in the first place. As a consequence of the Patriot Act, government now has access to all sorts of private and commercial databases that were previously off limits.": "John",
  "You see these casting directors' lists of characters, and they're all boxed in. Twenties is the hot girlfriend, thirties you can still be hot but moving swiftly to hot mum. Forties, you're the legal person in a pantsuit. Then, once you reach your fifties, you're positively elderly.": "Thandie",
  "Driving at high speed where safe and legal is part of my life. As well as a higher top speed I wanted even better stability in my FX and that meant work on the aerodynamics.": "Sebastian",
  "The legal principle placing the burden of proof on accusers rather than the accused can be traced back to Second and Third Century Roman jurist, Julius Paulus Prudentissimus. Yet, this ancient concept, which forms the legal and moral cornerstone of the American judicial system, is quickly being undermined in the name of 'national security.'": "Bob",
  "Foreigners like me have no privacy rights whatsoever. Yet we keep using U.S.-based services all the time, making us a legal target for gathering and storing our private information. Other countries do surveillance as well. But nobody has the global visibility that United States does.": "Mikko",
  "This is sort of typical Hillary Clinton: to do things that are not legal, to say that they are, and then try to cover them up. Hillary Clinton severely chastised other whistleblowers for using Internet channels that were not secure, and yet she herself was doing that with private, high-level State Department information.": "Jill",

  "The longer you remain silent, the longer you don't turn over documents, a presumption begins to build that you're withholding something. That's human nature. That may not be a legal presumption, but that's a common sense presumption.": "Trey",
  "It is high time to compel man by the might of right to give woman her political, legal and social rights. She will find her own sphere in accordance with her capacities, powers and tastes; and yet she will be woman still.": "Ernestine",

  "The only people that should vote should be legal.": "Pam",
  "If we can find a way to enforce our laws and keep people from coming into our country illegally while maintaining a strong legal immigration system, I think that's going to benefit everyone. If you come here illegally, and you commit a crime, you're not going to be able to stay in our country.": "Ronna",
  "Despite the vigorous policy and legal debates surrounding same-sex marriage, there is little disagreement about this: If the United States Supreme Court holds that states must sanction same-sex marriage, then Florida's contrary laws must fall.": "Pam",

  "The only people who benefit from lawsuits are lawyers. I think we made a couple of them rich.": "Gavin",
  "When I started law school I was shocked to learn that our legal system traditionally had the man as the head and master of the family. As late as the '70s and '80s when we were fighting for the Equal Rights Amendment, states like Louisiana still had a head and master law.": "Patricia",

  "One thing I was thinking about is that they probably get their come-uppance about the same percentage that people in real life do. Basically, stealing for all practical purposes might as well be legal in New York.": "Mike",
  "If I were in the middle of some kind of legal issue, I would get in my car and drive to Fenway. I'd get to the game early and sit in my seats and say, 'I'm home, I'm happy, and I love it here.' It was my therapy.": "Joseph",

  "When I read a book I liked, I would get a pen and one of my father's legal pads and rewrite it from memory as if I had thought of it myself. It was a clear sign that I wanted to be involved in writing, even if it was just pretend at that point.": "Jonathan",
  "I'm always writing something. There's always some structure sitting around someplace. There's always things on the computer, things scratched on score paper, legal tablets full of lyrics. It's never not buzzing around me all the time. I'm always doing it.": "J.",
  "I've always considered making it legal for Americans to import their prescription drugs a free-trade issue. Imports create competition and keep domestic industry more responsive to consumers.": "Chuck",
  "If you have been vaccinated for polio, mumps, measles, chicken pox, hepatitis, or rabies, it may be too late for you to stand your ethical ground: You have already benefited from fetal-tissue research. This is, after all, a practice that's been legal since the 1930s.": "Katha",

  "In this life and death case, I felt Mrs. Schiavo should receive the fullest due process from our legal system.": "Paul",
  "And they didn't have to get into a lot of legal speak or talk ER terms, they were real people. I think that's why so many actresses were attracted to it. And it was just about problems that you could identify with so much, right off the bat.": "James",
  "My first ever sex scene in a movie was in 'Superbad.' Because I was 17, for legal reasons my mother had to be on the set. It was real awkward, but it worked out OK because when I watched the movie with her, the sex scene wasn't awkward because she'd been right there when it happened.": "Christopher",
  "Once the Supreme Court in 1973 decided that infanticide could be legal, it not only ended America's 'inalienable right to life,' it threw the Golden Rule right off the shores of this continent.": "Michael",
  "I wish the government and the Minister of Justice would address these legal and constitutional arguments, but they refuse to. They want Canadians to go blindly into their brave new world, but it is not wise for a society to move blindly in any direction.": "Stockwell",

  "I think my dad did legal work for someone who had a Packard Bell 8088, and they couldn't pay him, so they gave him a computer. I was initially not allowed to touch it, but that didn't last long. I started tinkering with it, and there were many times I screwed up the computer.": "Jeremy",
  "A duped newspaper or magazine could contend that a fiction-spouting journalist obtained part of his salary via fraud, and use a criminal proceeding to try and recoup that money. Given the profession's notoriously low wages, however, it's probably not worth the publicity headache and legal fees. No news organization has ever pursued such a case.": "Brendan",
  "People have always heard voices. Sometimes they're called shamans, sometimes they're called mad, and sometimes they're called fiction writers. I always feel lucky that I live in a culture where fiction writing is legal and not seen as pathology.": "Ruth",

  "Testimony should be a philosophical problem and not limited to legal or historical contexts where it refers to the account of a witness who reports what he has seen.": "Paul",
  "I'm afraid I talk a lot, too much, perhaps. I should have been a lawyer or a college professor or a windy politician, though I'm glad I am not any of these.": "Tom",
  "So much business is based on the belief that we should do whatever we can within legal limits to make as much money as we can. Ben & Jerry's was based on values, and we try to operate a business that not just sells ice cream but partners with all our stakeholders - whether that's suppliers or customers - to bring about a more sustainable world.": "Jerry",
  "Lawsuits should not be used to destroy a viable and independent distribution system. The solution lies in the marketplace and not the courtroom.": "Don",
  "Food is like a legal drug. You can take 50 cents and walk into the store and buy a Twinkie and get high. And it's killing people.": "Fat",
  "It is imperative that when thousands of selfless volunteers respond to those who have incurred the wrath of a natural disaster that legal liability need not be hanging over their heads.": "Jon",
  "Perhaps these Ten Commandments cases will be the turning point in the legal war against religion.": "Cliff",
  "Every non-political human grouping of whatever kind, legal, social, religious, economic or other becomes at last political if it creates an opposition deep enough to range men against one another as enemies.": "Francis",
  "Under current law volunteers who are not working with an official nonprofit organization are not covered by the Volunteer Protection Act. Therefore, there are absolutely no legal protections for the average American who wishes to volunteer.": "Jon",

  "I wouldn't pretend to tell you we don't pay our lawyers well.": "Jay",
  "Our country was thereby saved from the consequences of its distracting individualistic conception of democracy, and its merely legal conception of nationality. It was because the followers of Jackson and Douglas did fight for it, that the Union was preserved.": "Herbert",
  "I think people should have the legal right to hurt themselves without fearing that they're going to get locked up for doing so. But on a personal level, if someone I loved was hurting himself or herself in front of me, I would, of course, try to restrain them.": "Chester",

  "To some lawyers, all facts are created equal.": "Felix",
  "I began my legal career working for Byron White, the last Coloradan to serve on the Supreme Court, and the only justice to lead the N.F.L. in rushing. He was one of the smartest and most courageous men I've ever known.": "Neil",
  "I've learned that most of gay America is coupled up, or looking to be. No wonder gay marriage has such traction. So many of us are already in it, so of course we want the legal benefits.": "Bruce",
  "A good lawyer is a bad Christian.": "John",
  "It is simply a fact that the birth rate of our illegal immigrants exceeds that of our legal residents.": "John",
  "I believe if an individual wants to join organized labor and work under a union contract, they should have the legal right to do so. At the same token, a person who does not want to work under organized labor and wants to work should have the ability to do so without the threat of having to join and having to pay dues to organized labor.": "Paul",
  "Everywhere among the English-speaking race criminal justice was rude, and punishments were barbarous; but the tendency was to do away with special privileges and legal exemptions.": "Albert",
  "Disarming Iraq is legal under a series of U.N. resolutions. Iraq is in flagrant violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions.": "Jose",
  "In my view, targeted lethal force is at its least controversial when it is on its strongest, most traditional legal foundation. The essential mission of the U.S. military is to capture or kill an enemy. Armies have been doing this for thousands of years. As part of a congressionally authorized armed conflict, the foundation is even stronger.": "Jeh",
  "Under well-settled legal principles, lethal force against a valid military objective, in an armed conflict, is consistent with the law of war and does not, by definition, constitute an 'assassination.'": "Jeh",
  "Human-rights advocates, for example, claim that the mistreatment of Iraqi prisoners is of a piece with President Bush's 2002 decision to deny al Qaeda and Taliban fighters the legal status of prisoners of war under the Geneva Conventions.": "John",
  "While Taliban fighters had an initial claim to protection under the conventions, they lost POW status by failing to obey the standards of conduct for legal combatants: wearing uniforms, a responsible command structure, and obeying the laws of war.": "John",
  "Once the attacks occur, as we learned on Sept. 11, it is too late. It makes little sense to deprive ourselves of an important, and legal, means to detect and prevent terrorist attacks while we are still in the middle of a fight to the death with al Qaeda.": "John",
  "Upon the Constitution, upon the pre-existing legal rights of the People, as understood in this country and in England, I have argued that this House is bound to revive the Petition under debate.": "Caleb",

  "A written constitution guides and directs the application of law in a way utterly unlike oral guidance. It reminds us that the certainty and consistency of legal application is essential.": "Edwin",
  "I think it's pathetic that a court of law cannot be in a vacuum of the legal system, without the influence of the public threatening to do great bodily harm to people and property. It's really a pathetic statement for our country.": "Mark",
  "The Democratic Party looks at massive immigration, legal and illegal, as a source of voters.": "Tom",
  "The Republican Party looks at massive immigration, legal and illegal, as a source of cheap labor, satisfying a very important constituency.": "Tom",

  "It was not possible to broadcast any of that because of an agreement between Jackson and the family. Our legal advice was that we could not broadcast it.": "Martin",
  "In regards to The Haunting, people compared it to the old movie, which is unfair. We didn't have the rights to the movie. I couldn't duplicate a single thing because that would have been legal infringement.": "Jan",

  "Truly I never thought of myself as writing legal thrillers, and I still don't think I do. I write stories about women.": "Lisa",
  "The Singaporean government, which represents legal migrant workers in employment disputes and claims of exploitation, requires that they stay in the country until the disputes are settled. If they leave, their claims are closed.": "Alan",
  "I also urge the Obama administration - both on its own and in cooperation with other responsible governments around the world - to use all legal means necessary to shut down WikiLeaks before it can do more damage by releasing additional cables. WikiLeaks' activities represent a shared threat to collective international security.": "Joe",

  "Literature is made upon any occasion that a challenge is put to the legal apparatus by conscience in touch with humanity.": "Nelson",
  "If we want to set and enforce a limit on immigration, we have to be willing to say no to would-be immigrants who look a lot like our own ancestors, not because there's anything wrong with them, but simply because admitting them would exceed our legal limit.": "Jan",
  "There is no quick fix for illegal immigration. But only when we achieve better control of our borders and better respect for our immigration laws can we give meaning to the discussion we need to have over reforming the numbers, categories, and procedures for legal immigration into the United States.": "Jan",

  "Instead, California is one of only 10 states that provides in-state college and university tuition to illegal immigrants. That's grossly unfair to a legal high school student who moves out of California for a year, then returns to attend college.": "Elton",
  "Consular cards were not designed to be identification and no treaty recognizes them as such. Legal travelers, visitors and long-term residents carried passports, visas or green cards for that purpose.": "Elton",

  "Embryonic stem cell research is legal in America, and nothing in the administration's current policy affects that legality; 400 lines are currently being used to conduct embryonic stem cell research, both in the private sector and by the Federal Government.": "Roger",
  "There's a misconception about Barack Obama as a former constitutional law professor. First of all, there are plenty of professors who are 'legal relativists.' They tend to view legal principles as relative to whatever they're trying to achieve.": "Jonathan",
  "I think it's very healthy to use journalistic and legal techniques to investigate the evidence for and against Christianity and other faith systems.": "Lee",

  "It was also my idea that the advisory committees of the Academy should replace the legal committees of the German Reichstag, which was gradually fading into the background in the Reich.": "Hans",
  "So my own suspicion is that the attorney has stopped this prosecution because part of her defence was to question legality and that would have brought his advice into the public domain again and there was something fishy about the way in which he said war was legal.": "Clare",
  "Hitler never abandoned the cloak of legality; he recognized the enormous psychological value of having the law on his side. Instead, he turned the law inside out and made illegality legal.": "Robert",
  "I like to think I'm a pretty good-natured guy and pretty civil and probably not ever truly guilty in any serious way of any legal infractions.": "Gregory",
  "Though every legal task demands this skill, it is especially important in the effort to frame public policy in a way that is properly responsive to human needs and predicaments. The question is always: How will the general rule work in practice?": "Elliot",

  "When I was at 'Newsweek' magazine - which, you know, this really sounds like I walked four miles in the snow to school - but I started at 'Newsweek' magazine in 1963, which was before the Civil Rights Act of 1964. So it was actually legal to discriminate against women, and 'Newsweek' did.": "Ellen",

  "I showed that privacy was an implicit right in Jewish law, probably going back to the second or third century, when it was elaborated on in a legal way.": "Norman",
  "I write longhand on legal pads, about half at home and half in cafes. I drink a lot of water and eat a lot of raw carrots.": "Daniel",
  "I write every day weekdays for about 5 hours, mostly longhand on legal pads. It has gotten neither harder nor easier, sadly or happily.": "Daniel",
  "When I consider a problem, it is now instinctive for me to think about the institutions involved, the authorizing environment, possible coalitions, likely opposition, implementation, legal issues, resource dimensions, communications - and how the problem fits into a stream of other issues.": "Robert",

  "I've learned to accept the fact that my students are far too busy preparing for their own legal careers to care one bit about the off-campus antics of Professor Burke. I get the impression that my students are vaguely aware of my novels, but are at best mildly curious.": "Alafair",
  "When you look at the big issues post-9/11 in the United States, whether it's water boarding, warantless wire tapping, surveillance, Gitmo, black sites rendition, all of those have been legal. Nobody has gone to jail for those programs.": "Matt",

  "But you can count the dead bodies from alcohol, tobacco, and legal pharmaceuticals by the millions.": "Jack",
  "It is curious that, with my somewhat antinomian tendencies, I should have gone to Trinity Hall - which was, and is, before all a Law College - and should thus have been thrown into close touch with the legal element in life.": "Edward",

  "I decided I wanted to be a lawyer when I was 11 years of age.": "Johnnie",
  "But if we get to the point where more people do not believe in a God than who do believe in God, we will have a hollow legal system - we will have something without heart.": "Lee",
  "I come from a profession which has suffered greatly because of the lack of civility. Lawyers treat each other poorly and it has come home to haunt them. The public will not tolerate a lack of civility.": "James",
  "My first girlfriend broke up with me on a yellow legal pad. After she picked me up from the airport one day, she took out a letter that her therapist wrote, and she read it to me. She and her therapists wrote a letter breaking up with me together.": "Max",
  "I have a book coming out in September, for example, where the plot concerns counterfeiting, and I had to do a lot of research on that. Or on any legal matters, for example, I have to do a lot of research online.": "Evan",
  "My job is to interpret the law based on how the legislature and the court has done it and then, of course, to use our system of justice to develop some new legal tools and new concepts.": "Bill",
  "We're involved right now in some very significant legal battles and it would be the wrong thing for me to do to step out in the middle of those battles.": "Bill",

  "The people and the mindset that killed 3,000 of our fellow citizens on September 11 2001, would have killed not 3,000, but 300,000 if they could have or 3 million or 30 million. We need to do everything we can within our value systems and legal structures to make sure that doesn't happen.": "Tim",
  "I'm overly excited to finally announce this amazing global partnership deal back home with EMI Music. I know I have mentioned doing music in the past but for legal reasons I was not in a position to release any new music.": "Melanie",

  "When the Senate ceases to engage nominees in meaningful discussion of legal issues, the confirmation process takes on an air of vacuity and farce, and the Senate becomes incapable of either properly evaluating nominees or appropriately educating the public.": "Elena",
  "To have the opportunity to lead the Solicitor General's office is the honor of a lifetime. As you know, this is an office with a long and rich tradition, not only of extraordinary legal skill but also of extraordinary professionalism and integrity. That is due, in large measure, to the people who have led it.": "Elena",
  "It is impossible to tell where the law stops and justice begins.": "Arthur",

  "Companies shouldn't use the law to prevent consumers from doing something legal.": "Jon",
  "I hope gay marriage will be legal in every state.": "Mark",
  "We need to be discussing issues specifically to help the American people. And that would not include illegal aliens. These are people - I'm for immigration - legal immigration. I've been an immigration attorney. But people who have come to our country and violated laws, we should not be providing full health care services.": "Joe",
  "The legacy of slavery comes from the sustained political, legal and economic effort to link permanently an entire group of people to poverty - and to mystify that systematic disenfranchisement by making up something called race, which could serve as a distraction.": "Sarah",

  "I used to want to be a lawyer, but I didn't want to have half my brain sucked out.": "Max",
  "Being under the microscope meant I was never given any slack. I still managed to screw up plenty in life, mind you, but in the things I really cared about - the legal work, or the stories I was telling as a writer, or the office I built in government - I wasn't left a lot of margin for error. It's kept me driven.": "Ronan",
  "I've been working at performing for five years now. I've been working in Australia and Spain and England. When I was only 15 or 16, 1 was performing in bars; I could have had legal problems, but it's also the only way to get to know what music is all about.": "Andy",

  "There are obviously legal restrictions on what you can do on TV in the States, as there are everywhere.": "Dave",

  "In my book, I detail the critical information we obtained from al Qaeda terrorists after they became compliant following a short period of enhanced interrogation. I have no doubt that that interrogation was legal, necessary and saved lives.": "Jose",
  "We knew that if the photos of CIA officers conducting authorized EIT (enhanced interrogation techniques) ever got out, the difference between a legal, authorized, necessary, and safe program and the mindless actions of some MPs (military police) would be buried by the impact of the images.": "Jose",

  "The right to a trial is a core principle of the American legal system. Depriving Americans of these essential liberties undermines the Constitution while doing nothing to strengthen our national security.": "John",

  "When you do a studio picture, all the paperwork and legal stuff is already taken care of!": "David",
  "I have always been delighted when told there was a piece of fanfic inspired by a book of mine floating about. I don't read it for legal reasons, but I'm thrilled to know it's there. Someone cared. Someone loved it enough to spend their free time writing about it for free.": "Catherynne",
  "To force a lawyer on a defendant can only lead him to believe that the law contrives against him.": "Potter",

  "About 10 years ago, in an effort to gain a better grasp on McCone's world, I took up the hobby of building fully electrified scale models: first of the legal cooperative where she started out, and then of her own brown-shingled cottage, a pursuit that the more tactful of my friends label unusual, and that the more blunt refer to as obsessive.": "Marcia",
  "While there continues to be differences, the important point is that all citizens and elected officials use democratic and legal avenues for solving those differences.": "Boris",
  "In the early centuries of Islam, the great schools of Islamic jurisprudence were built upon the above principles. Basic to all their legal systems they developed the doctrine that liberty is the fundamental basis of law.": "Aly",

  "I will do everything by apply with all the legal and apply with the rule of law. And the main important thing that I have to be fairness to everyone, not just only one person.": "Yingluck",
  "With 'GoldenEye,' the franchise got locked into this legal fight. They couldn't make new Bond movies for about seven years. It was my first huge production. I figured if I did at least a yeoman-like job, it would be greeted as a complete revival of the series.": "Martin",
  "On my first day on the set of 'Boston Legal,' I thought the director was calling me 'Candice' instead of 'Constance.' But I didn't realize he was actually talking to Candice Bergen.": "Constance",
  "Part of doing mash-ups is getting the legal rights to use the songs. If you're going to do a mash-up with five songs, you should probably find 10 songs, because you're only going to get half of them cleared. It's a real collaborative effort.": "Harvey",
  "There are a lot of Latinos who believe that allowing illegal immigrants to cut in front of the line ahead of those pursuing the legal path sends the wrong signal. The GOP needs to articulate that message respectfully but boldly.": "Angela",
  "I've always been driven by the concept of equal justice under the law, but only the rich can pay great sums of money for legal assistance and that puts them at an advantage over the poor.": "Samuel",

  "If you spend five minutes with me or watch me try to balance my checkbook, you can only imagine the disaster I would make of anyone's legal issues.": "Greg",
  "I don't think any business has to give up legal protections in order to simplify. The main consideration is that whatever protection, rights and remedies a corporation wants, they should be put in terms that are understandable to the consumer.": "Alan",
  "I do think there's a difference between what a religious leader says and does and what a public official or legislator does. But there's no question that a lot of our legal underpinnings find a good bit of their foundations in the Scriptures.": "Bob",
  "For families to access affordable housing, they often need legal representation that takes their side against abusive landlords.": "Nydia",
  "Yes, there's such a thing as luck in trial law but it only comes at 3 o'clock in the morning. You'll still find me in the library looking for luck at 3 o'clock in the morning.": "Louis",
  "I would expect illegal alien parents to take care of their children. If it means the kids go back home with them, that's what happens. If it means there are legal relatives in the United States that can take care of them, that can happen to. But I believe it's the parents responsibility to take care of the kids.": "Mo",

  "I saw a cardinal when I was in Brooklyn, and I was almost moved to tears. I was, like, 'I can't believe this thing is legal. I can't believe this thing is in the wild. How did this happen? How has someone not killed them all? They're so conspicuous. They're gorgeous. How can they still be alive?'": "Nell",

  "There's no legal protection for cyborgs. In 2010, I started the Cyborg Foundation to defend our rights. Cyborgs have been kicked out from several places because they are seen as a possible security threat.

  "I do try very hard to develop themes that are easily understood and that, hopefully, will paint vivid images of the legal principles and implications of the ruling that will stick in the Justices' heads and will help influence how they think about the case.": "Patricia",
  "The practice of law requires both continuity and growth - a deep understanding of legal principles born of reason, tradition, and experience and tested by time, but also a mind alert to present needs and the future consequences of public and private legal decisions.": "Diane",
  "We do not need a heavy theoretical thumb on the scales. What's important is how the traditional sources of law and legal interpretation - text, structure, history, canons of interpretation, precedent, and other well-established tools of the judicial craft - are prioritized, weighted, and applied.": "Diane",

  "I miss New York. I like the country and I like the people. However, the U.S. political and legal system is prone to overreaction.": "Marc",
  "Class action lawsuits are an important part of our legal system. All citizens should have the right to band together and settle grievances with bigger companies, but that system is broken and it needs fixing.": "Thomas",
  "I have a problem with censorship by the lawyer - by legal people by the publishing firm, and I may be changing publishers. They don't seem to want to take too many risks with living people.": "Kenneth",
  "The job of the press is to speak truth to power. And yet, for doing our job, we are persecuted. I say that these aggressive and illegal tactics to silence us - inventing arbitrary legal interpretations, over-zealous charges and disproportionate sentences - must not be permitted to succeed.": "Sara",
  "There are several authors who are also lawyers - and not only the ones who write legal thrillers. There are other attorneys who write romantic fiction, and I know of at least one who writes young adult books.": "Candace",
  "I'd worked in the state senate in college and seen how important legal decisions were. And at the last minute, Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison said, 'Why don't you come do an internship?' That turned into almost 15 years in the government, in the White House, and at the State Department.": "Dina",

  "An invitation to a wedding invokes more trouble than a summons to a police court.": "William",
  "One tradition I have with my friends is that when one of us gets married, we have a ton of fragrance oils and pretty bottles at the bachelorette party. Everyone puts a drop or two in a bottle for the bride and makes a wish, and the bride wears our creation on her wedding day.": "Jennifer",
  "I remember when I was in school, they would ask, 'What are you going to be when you grow up?' and then you'd have to draw a picture of it. I drew a picture of myself as a bride.": "Gwen",

  "I like wearing my wedding ring, it's nice.": "Jerry",
  "I'd been a wedding singer through college, but after a few years of doing my best renditions of jazz standards to clinking glasses and the sound of forks on salad, I thought, 'Oh God, if this is all I do, I'll never be able to live with myself.'": "Idina",

  "My wedding was a very private affair for close family and friends, so I had decided to hold a reception in my native town.": "Mohit",
  "I've been looking at some video clips on YouTube of President Obama - then candidate Obama - going through Iowa making promises. The gap between his promises and his performance is the largest I've seen, well, since the Kardashian wedding and the promise of 'til death do we part.": "Mitt",

  "There is no way in the world anyone else could do my wedding other than myself, along with whomever I select to do various things.": "Aretha",
  "I don't really have many regrets. I did miss a lot of the events in the days leading up to my sister's wedding because I was at a U17 camp. There were moments like that growing up when I felt like I focused too much on soccer. But that's probably the reason I am where I am today.": "Alex",

  "If you're going to plan a wedding, then a certain amount of suffering is not a choice.": "Ellie",
  "You can have a wedding at Fenway Park.": "Mike",
  "If you're engaged more than a year, there's something up. There's lot of debate as to whether one should or shouldn't get married, but when you get engaged, it's a promise to get married, and if you don't just do it within a year, one of the parties is using the excuse of, like, 'I can't find the right venue' to put off the wedding.": "Nicholas",
  "I can see why people love the idea of a big white wedding - it is a day when they are the centre of attention and get to wear a beautiful dress. But that sounds awful to me because that is like getting ready to walk down the red carpet.": "Lucy",
  "The one thing that I'm in charge of in this wedding is the food.": "Rob",
  "I had a huge Indian wedding, and I did it for my wife, and I did it for my white friends.": "Hasan",

  "O month when they who love must love and wed.": "Helen",
  "I think a lot of people get so obsessed with the wedding and the expense of the wedding that they miss out on what the real purpose is. It's not about a production number, it's about a meaningful moment between two people that's witnessed by people that they actually really know and care about.": "Jane",
  "Our whole wedding cost 180 bucks. Afterward, we re-heated lasagna for everyone and set off fireworks.": "Larry",
  "I did get to keep the wedding dresses from 'Runaway Bride'. They're all boxed up in my garage. I've never opened them. It'll be fun one day when Hazel is taller. She can play dress-up with her friends.": "Julia",
  "What the bride should do is call guests who have young children and say: 'I'd love to have the kids at the wedding, but we won't have room. Would you get a baby sitter, and when we get back from our honeymoon, we'll have you guys over?'": "Letitia",
  "I do not have a bride gene. I haven't been planning a wedding since I was 3. I never put a sheet on my head and pretended that it was a veil.": "Niecy",
  "As a child, as a cinemagoer, I think there is nothing better than being in a cinema or watching a film. I think it's just a while magical... it almost feels like you're at a big party in India, where you're singing, you're dancing, you're laughing, you're crying, you feel like you're at a wedding because our films invariably cover all emotions.": "Karan",
  "The chain of wedlock is so heavy that it takes two to carry it - and sometimes three.": "Heraclitus",
  "I don't ever really feel that wearing my wedding ring is what determines me being married or not.": "Jessica",
  "Recently, I was preparing to sing Springsteen's 'If I Should Fall Behind' for a wedding and was unable to get through it without tears. My wife handed me 'Love You Forever.' I read it. I cried. But that cry somehow cured me of crying while singing the song. Go figure.": "Clyde",
  "I still love touring rock clubs around the world, and that's something that's really a part of me. I love making albums, and I'm a wedding singer on the side; that's my parallel career. So I love all those aspects of making music.": "Jens",
  "I have a crusade against fondant, also shortening. There's no reason why wedding cakes can't taste good if you know what you're doing.": "Ron",
  "Ever since I was a little girl, I wanted Valentino to design my wedding dress. Valentino is the definition of timeless elegance. I don't think there's another couture house like it.": "Nicky",
  "I can wear a sexy dress to any red carpet event. My wedding is my chance to go all the way and wear a princess silhouette.": "Roselyn",
  "If it were not for the presents, an elopement would be preferable.": "George",
  "I chose my wife, as she did her wedding gown, for qualities that would wear well.": "Oliver",
  "A gloomy guest fits not a wedding feast.": "Friedrich",
  "I'm one of those people who has always been a bridesmaid.": "Piper",
  "I see an insidious problem in the marketing of weddings as 'the happiest day of your life.' The pressure that is placed upon this event to be the alpha and omega of your entire existence makes it, I think, into a kind of nuptial New Year's Eve, and we all know how that usually turns out.": "Jessi",
  "I just wrapped this movie called 'The Wedding Crashers' which was a pretty big break for me.": "Bradley",
  "When I planned my wedding the first time, my ex-husband and I, we were both struggling comics. I had a TV show that had gotten cancelled. Basically, I rented a wedding gown; the reception hall smelled like feet.": "Sherri",
  "I met Prince William at a musical festival and he let me know he was a fan of my music. But the invitation to sing at his wedding reception came completely out of the blue. The fact that Kate and William knew the words to my songs was very touching.": "Ellie",
  "My family is almost exactly like the one in 'Monsoon Wedding'. We are very open, fairly liberal, loud people.": "Mira",
  "I learned hard lessons in life; I had to because I had so much happen: My mother died my sophomore year in high school. The next year, same day, my brother dropped dead. Two years after that, I got married because my girlfriend got pregnant. The year after my wedding, my father - who I had only recently met - died.": "Bernie",
  "My brother liked sewing and sculpting and making things, and my sister sewed and painted and cooked and baked. She's a professional baker now and makes the most gorgeous sculpture-like cakes. She's the queen of wedding cakes in the Lake Tahoe area.": "John",
  "Do I believe in coupling? Do I believe in commitment? Do I believe in co-parenting, raising children together, having a family, and growing old with someone? I absolutely believe in all of those things. I just don't believe that you need to be married to do that. I love going to weddings, though. I do love a good wedding.": "Laura",
  "Growing up, I was never the kind of girl to dream about wedding dresses and pretty houses.": "Louise",
  "Somebody ripped their pants open at my wedding, dipping my mother. My mother is not a lady who throws herself into a dip that often, so I don't think he thought she was really going to do it.": "Melissa",
  "I think the only consistent thing is that I like projects that explore different social themes. 'Our Family Wedding' is a comedy, but it deals with two different cultures coming together. It's also about people letting go.": "Forest",
  "I never wanted a big wedding. I never wanted to wear a white dress or throw a bouquet.": "Taylor",
  "I loved everything about my wedding look, but, in retrospect, I would have changed the position of where we attached the veil on my head. Make sure you test a few different placements and styles before the big day to make a clear vision and plan with your hairstylist.": "Margherita",
  "My wedding was at home, so I didn't really want to wear a veil in my house. Instead I wore a lot of diamond hair clips. They were brooches, actually, designed by Lorraine Schwartz.": "Georgina",
  "It's very nice to be asked to anybody's wedding. Particularly if it's the Prince of Wales. I learned a lot from it, which was to end early and get away. I suppose one would have to look back historically and see who other royals had at their weddings. Were there people at Queen Elizabeth's wedding who were common like myself?": "Jools",
  "I am the center of attention in my job every single day the thought of a wedding to me is exhausting. Why would I put myself through that? ": "Lady",
  "Each youth betrays considerable anxiety about the wedding night ahead.": "Gore",
  "I always envisioned myself having a traditional and elegant wedding.": "Ivanka",
  "An embellished top with slim pants is great, even for a wedding.": "Brad",
  "I always had boyfriends, but I never imagined a proposal or a wedding. To me, that was like having a ball and chain round your neck.": "Sandra",
  "When I got married, I hired a great choir - the St. James Choir, an all-black gospel choir - to sing at my wedding.": "Brad",
  "I moved to the city in August of 1980, and someone I thought was a friend had an apartment in this wedding cake of a building, so I slept on her couch for a few days.": "Holly",
  "My uncle was an Elvis impersonator - his name was Perry, and he went by 'Elvis Perry' - and my work as a wedding singer landed me a spot in his act.": "Ryan",
  "I wanna stay an eternal girlfriend. I want to have my boyfriend's children, but I don't think we need a piece of paper to regulate the game, and we don't have to go through the whole stress of a wedding and suffering to throw a good party.": "Shakira",
  "I've always been the type to fall in love fast and, with every boyfriend, I plan out my wedding in my head.": "Kim",
  "Narciso Rodriguez was my first fashion big brother. He made my wedding dress, which was wonderful.": "Claire",
  "I think that weddings have probably been crashed since the beginning of time. Cavemen crashed them. You go to meet girls. It makes sense.": "Christopher",
  "I've never crashed a wedding. When I was a kid I, of course, used to crash parties. Crashing a wedding is difficult though because you have to have the suit, and you have to have information in case someone catches you. You have to know at least some names and something.": "Christopher",
  "I've always had a propensity for getting the cursive down pretty well. What it evolved into was my pseudo-waitressing job when I was auditioning. I didn't wait tables. I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton's wedding.": "Meghan",
  "I did calligraphy for the invitations for, like, Robin Thicke and Paula Patton's wedding.": "Meghan",
  "So many little girls dream about their wedding day. But with actresses, sometimes it's the inverse, because we get to be the centre of attention, looked up and down, dressed up for premieres all the time. The pull isn't quite as great.": "Natalie",
  "Everywhere I go, people ask me about Jennifer Aniston's wedding. Everywhere I go. I always say to her, I'm like, 'Being friends with you is a burden. You think it's hard to be friends with me?'": "Chelsea",
  "I met Jason on a charity walk in 2001, and we got married on a friend's boat in Panama two years later. It was the perfect wedding for two people who'd already been married and who weren't teenagers.": "Mariella",
  "I found out I was pregnant seven days after my wedding. I was on honeymoon with my family.": "Bryce",
  "I'm old school. We're from a small town in Georgia, and I think if we do pictures before the wedding, I think I'm gonna be blindfolded.": "Brantley",
  "Every wedding is slightly different from the other. But you always get to meet the funny uncle and the weirdo relatives, and there's always someone trying to beat you up for not playing enough Beatles songs or something.": "Jens",
  "I didn't go abroad until quite late. A friend drove us to Amalfi, Italy, for his sister's wedding when I was a teenager. It was exciting driving through Europe.": "David",
  "We served Twinkies and Sno Balls at our wedding. We put them on silver trays so they looked elegant - but they were the real deal!": "Dylan",
  "I love dress shopping, and I love talking about the wedding food. That's what makes me happy. If you tell me to do a guest list, I cry. I hate it.": "Chrissy",
  "I am usually part of any disaster at a wedding if I'm a bridesmaid, which I've been lucky enough to be several times.": "Jennifer",
  "On the publicity tour of 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding,' I was asked over and over again, if, as the writer, I felt it was a fair depiction of real life to have someone of my er, below average looks, hook up with hottie John Corbett.": "Nia",
  "I thought I was attractive when I shot 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.' Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them.": "Nia",
  "The white hot publicity that came from 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' was appreciated but not sought, so I was happy to walk away from it and then write.": "Nia",
  "I was in a fertility situation publicly, so I disappeared. I was very satisfied just being to able to creatively express myself with writing. The white hot publicity that came from 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding' was appreciated but not sought, so I was happy to walk away from it and then write.": "Nia",
  "I thought I was attractive when I shot 'My Big Fat Greek Wedding.' Studio executives and movie reviewers let me know I had a confidence in my looks that was not shared by them. In other words, they labeled me with words like overweight, unattractive, unappealing.": "Nia",
  "It gave me a lot of pleasure and pride that 90 percent of the crew for 'Monsoon Wedding,' and most of my film, are women. We get the work done, you know, much lesser play of ego... And I really believe in harmony, I believe in working in a spirit of egolessness and that the film is bigger than all of us.": "Mira",
  "I used to love to create outfits, and I still do - I just don't have the time. How can you wear one thing and never wear it again? Even my wedding dress - I had a dress made that I could wear again. I'm a child of the depression, so I'm very, very practical.": "Iris",
  "Seriously I suspected I was a good actor, though I didn't know it during 'Monsoon Wedding.' Now I realize the more I learn, the less I know about acting... and life.": "Randeep",
  "A woman seldom asks advice before she has bought her wedding clothes.": "Joseph",
  "You know that scene in 'Runaway Bride' when Julia Roberts puts on the amazing wedding dress and looks at herself in the mirror and goes, 'Swish, swish'? I loved that moment so much when I was a little girl.": "Lily",
  "On my wedding day. I didn't want a natural, blushing-bride look - I had a full-on hairdo and red lips. I thought it would be disingenuous to do the whole virginal look, so even though I had the white dress, I had pink net underneath.": "Sophie",
  "I think if you're at the point where you're popular enough to sell your wedding photos to OK! Magazine then you don't need the money.": "Johnny",
  "My favorite time to dance is at, like, wedding receptions, when it's all ages and everyone seems to be having fun.": "Neil",
  "So many people say you have to remember to grab hold of your bride or groom and spend time with them. I think if we had done a traditional wedding, we would have been doing it for everyone else, but this was about the two of us.": "Katherine",
  "I've already been married six times in my career as an actress - twice as Becky - so I think a wedding of my own might feel too much like work!": "Katherine",
  "I love going to other people's weddings, but I have never desired a big white wedding for myself, and it has never been put on me as a pressure, an expectation.": "Katherine",
  "I sang a song at my sister's wedding. My mother forced me into that, too. But that one felt all right.": "Adam",
  "I use filming as an excuse to take classes. I got my certification in sailing for 'Wedding Crashers,' and now I can handle a 26-foot boat. I played a seamstress once, so I took sewing classes. I love dipping into these other lives.": "Rachel",
  "I love auditioning. Since 'The Notebook' and 'Wedding Crashers,' I don't have to audition anymore, and I miss it. You get to show your interpretation of the character. I get nervous when I don't audition. What if they hate what I want to do?": "Rachel",
  "If I do find myself walking up the aisle and dancing at my own wedding reception, I want the first dance to be both spontaneous and dramatic.": "Anton",
  "I'd want it to be really special to both of us, but I'm a huge fan of 'At Last' as a wedding song. But what's also really cool is songs that no one else would have at their wedding, like an obscure Radiohead song.": "Mary",
  "I grew up in a very small town, but it happened to be in western Massachusetts, where there were a lot of gay people. I remember my aunt going to a gay wedding when I was 11, and I thought it was the coolest thing.": "Elizabeth",
  "I'm used to being in front of camera and knowing what to think. But if you're asking me to be me, I get very self-conscious. My job isn't to be me. Being an actor, people think you can do a eulogy at a funeral, a speech at a wedding. I find all that very nerve-racking.": "Eddie",
  "I try to remember, as I hear about friends getting engaged, that it's not about the ring and it's not about the wedding. It's a grave thing, getting married. And it's easy to get swept up in the wrong things.": "Gwyneth",
  "I'm obsessed with Kate Middleton. Obsessed. I loved the Royal Wedding. I was so cynical going into it, and pseudo-political about the whole thing, but as soon as I saw her, I was utterly charmed. I'm just completely enchanted by Kate and William.": "Anne",
  "After 'Muriel's Wedding,' I first went to America, and I was sent all these scripts about fat girls overcoming hurdles. Something in me knew not to go down that road, even if it was a good script.": "Toni",
  "People ask if my parents are hippies, but they're actually very conservative. A girl called Rebel sang at their wedding, and that's where my name came from.": "Rebel",
  "For my first wedding, I cried all the way down the aisle. My fake eyelash came off. My nose was red. My eyes were swollen. I'm not one of those pretty criers.": "Sherri",
  "I don't talk about my personal life in the press that's how I kept my wedding a secret. ": "Kerry",
  "I wanted to define the vocabulary of a wedding both visually and intellectually. The book is about more than weddings or wedding dresses. It's a metaphor for women's lives, their creativity.": "Vera",
  "There was no relationship between a wedding dress and fashion. There was no good taste, either. I realized that I could make an impression in terms of changing and readdressing the whole industry of bridal.": "Vera",
  "One of the great things about being a writer/journalist is that my boss loves me to go out and do features on being someone else. I did a feature on Kate Middleton, where I went to an incredible fancy state home in the countryside, put on a wedding dress and posed for engagement pictures with a fake Prince William.": "Caitlin",
  "I was never the girl who tore pictures out of wedding magazines.": "Camila",
  "You can easily take photographs at a wedding - no one would question it. But funerals are different.": "Martin",
  "I just wasn't one of those girls who dreamt of her wedding day and the birth of her first child.": "Sarah",
  "I think a lot of people who feel as though they desperately want to be married oftentimes simply desperately want to have a wedding.": "Elizabeth",
  "I myself have never been enchanted by the dream of the white wedding, and, heaven help us, the expectation that this exquisitely catered event should be 'the happiest moment' of one's life.": "Elizabeth",
  "Well, I'll tell you something, this wedding is something that I will always, always cherish. It was a show of love and support and kindness like I'd never seen from the people, and that's who I entertain. I entertain the people.": "Liza",
  "I love both real and fake jewelry. My kids make me necklaces, and I wear those, too. Every day, I wear my gold wedding band and the Cartier watch my husband gave me.": "Aerin",
  "There's been a lot of wedding songs and proposals. It's cool because when they play it at weddings so, it means a lot to them. That's a big deal. They're always going to remember 'Head Over Boots' as played at their wedding.": "Jon",
  "I get offered: 'Here's a girl who's mad at another girl for having a wedding on the same day.' That'll be a big hit, but I don't want to do that.": "Amy",
  "I don't want a huge wedding. I don't want it to be some huge spectacle.": "Kristin",
  "The wedding took place in Vermont, where they have legalized gay civil unions, and I married a woman.": "Craig",
  "I would absolutely, definitely never sell my wedding pictures to a magazine. I'd like it to be a special day, not a photo shoot. And once you've done that, your marriage becomes everybody else's business.": "Katherine",
  "It is sweet that people want to know everything about my wedding, but they should also respect my privacy.": "Divyanka",
  "I am a celebrity, but I don't want people standing outside my wedding venue.": "Divyanka",
  "Wedding: the point at which a man stops toasting a woman and begins roasting her.": "Helen",
  "Hats are the epitome of Englishness, and a royal wedding is the penultimate moment for a hat designer. I'm Irish, but I am a royalist and I believe in fantasy.": "Philip",
  "Often, what makes my job so exciting is designing for the mother whose dream has been to wear one of my hats at her child's wedding. I feel as responsible for making her feel like a million dollars as I do for somebody in the public eye.": "Philip",
  "It's always great to have things from France at a wedding. It's symbolic of style, of culture, of taste.": "Andre",
  "Neil Gaiman is a star. He constructs stories like some demented cook might make a wedding cake, building layer upon layer, including all kinds of sweet and sour in the mix.": "Clive",
  "A big part of being in a wedding is the financial obligation, and that's something that people don't really talk about, but if you're asked to be in a wedding, you're gonna have to fork over some cash.": "Kristen",
  "I hope that when I'm 80 years old, people will still be talking about my wedding.": "Jennifer",
  "All the information you could want is constantly streaming at you like a runaway truck - books, newspaper stories, Web sites, apps, how-to videos, this article you're reading, even entire magazines devoted to single subjects like charcuterie or wedding cakes or pickles.": "Mario",
  "After 'Wedding Crashers' I was just surprised as to the lack of comedic female material there is. So I had to start working and getting stuff out there for myself.": "Isla",
  "The only time I ever look good dancing is if I'm next to my dad at a wedding.": "Cat",
  "Whenever I went to a wedding or a party, girls kept complaining about their shoes. I love to dance, and I wanted them to have shoes they could keep on all night.": "Edgardo",
  "I love doing comedy. Absolutely love it. After 'Wedding Crashers,' people suddenly realized that it was something I could do.": "Jane",
  "It's interesting because a lot of my 16-year-old kids' friends know me from 'Wedding Crashers,' and not so much Bond. My kids have a good laugh. I was 20 then. The look I had then was the look that a lot of their friends are assuming now. They think it's cool. What goes around comes around.": "Jane",
  "When I auditioned for 'Wedding Crashers,' the producers had never seen any of my other work except for Bond. I got 'Wedding Crashers' partly because I was a Bond girl.": "Jane",
  "I hadn't been in Vegas 20 minutes when I got word that the bookmakers were offering three to one that Frank wouldn't show for my wedding.": "Sammy",
  "I saw a photo of a Christian Lacroix couture dress when I was in my teens and decided right then that that's how I wanted to look on my wedding day. In my mind, that's what angels looked like.": "Margherita",
  "I have a memory of my mother kneeling in front of a cabinet in our home, tenderly cradling her wedding china. We never used the plates; she died in her 40s without ever letting herself enjoy these gorgeous pieces. I told myself that I would use my precious items.": "Roma",
  "Personally, I'm an advocate for short engagements. Long sometimes means there is a reason for it. Two years engaged and no wedding... I'd be upset.": "Emily",
  "Growing up, I had one very specific idea of what a wedding should be, and that was the wedding of Fraeulein Maria and Captain von Trapp in 'The Sound of Music.'": "Ellie",

  "When I got married in 1991, I had never been to a wedding, so I didn't know that my wedding was tacky. I didn't know that I was getting married in a quinceanera dress, because there was nobody there to cry over me and tell me I look like a fool.": "Niecy",
  "I don't want to be Carrie Bradshaw. I don't want the wedding to be bigger than Big. I'm just grateful to know that the first time I fell in love wasn't the last time.": "Niecy",
  "It took two months from the day my fiance proposed to my first Google search for 'wedding planning: how?' Now, let me interrupt myself here and share how much I hate using the word 'fiance.' It's so fancy, and it's hard not to sound like a jerk saying it. Which is why I will be using my own word for fiance: gloob.": "Ellie",
  "I am fully anticipating that something - perhaps many things - will not go according to plan on our actual wedding day. If some of the flowers are wilted, or there aren't enough vegetarian meals, or the priest calls me the wrong name, I will embrace these errors.": "Ellie",
  "In the '50s, a lot of girls never saw beyond the wedding day.": "Helen",
  "I had a Hebraic wedding in New York, so I'm definitely Jewish.": "Amar'e",
  "The wedding ring on my left hand was bought by my grandfather, Samuel Miliband, in Brussels in 1920. I never knew him, as he died when I was one. But his ring was kept by my aunt until it was placed on my finger by my wife Louise 32 years later.": "David",
  "Whenever I get married, it will be a Bengali wedding. If I won't have a Bengali wedding, my mother won't come. She has warned me. So, I am going to have a Bengali wedding for sure.": "Bipasha",
  "My wedding won't be a hush-hush affair. When I get married, everyone will get to know about it... there'll be nothing speculative about my wedding.": "Bipasha",
  "I'm a jewelry girl. I became with friends with designer Irene Neuwirth a few years ago. At that point, I just used to wear my wedding rings. Very low key. Now, if I could, I'd be draped from head to toe in her jewelry all the time. Everything she makes is beautiful.": "Busy",
  "Music played at weddings always reminds me of the music played for soldiers before they go into battle.": "Heinrich",
  "I use Pinterest for everything. Book collections, trips, hobbies. It's all there. I planned my wedding on it. When I had a kid, I planned all his stuff on it. So it was nice to discover that I wasn't the only one.": "Ben",
  "My problem with the wedding industry started when I studied in college and liked to have the television on in the background, and 'A Wedding Story' on TLC always came on, and I'd get irritated that the story of two people making a lifelong commitment to each other could be encapsulated in a half-hour show about the party they throw.": "Jessica",
  "Not everyone can be successful selling fashion at $25,000 for a wedding outfit. Certain designers are able to do that. And there is only a certain amount of consumers who can do that. The real opportunity is in that $25 garment.": "Imran",

  "I'll never have a wedding. I don't want to marry just to do what everybody else is doing.": "Mr.",
  "I saw a photograph of a wedding conducted by Reverend Moon of the Unification Church. I wanted to understand this event, and the only way to understand it was to write about it.": "Don",
  "I am happy. I have a wonderful marriage. I was in a not-great second marriage for 20 years, then I fell in love with Steve, my first husband, again, and we remarried. I wore the dress from our first wedding in 1982 - it was tight, but I could get into it.": "Marie",
  "I haven't made many wedding dresses. It's a dress very, very important for the girl; it's important to know the person, I believe, but at the same time it should be a shock to the person - the person should be shocked to be suddenly revealed. That's the work of a designer sometimes, to propose an ID of look.": "Olivier",
  "When the wedding march sounds the resolute approach, the clock no longer ticks, it tolls the hour. The figures in the aisle are no longer individuals, they symbolize the human race.": "Anne",
  "When I had a job catering, I catered a wedding for the Smashing Pumpkins bassist in Indiana. And I served Billy Corgan shrimp off a tray.": "Amy",

  "When widows exclaim loudly against second marriages, I would always lay a wager than the man, If not the wedding day, is absolutely fixed on.": "Henry",
  "We always talk about how the first several seasons were faithful to the books, and anybody who wanted to could go onto Wikipedia and learn Ned Stark gets beheaded or about The Red Wedding, and most people don't want to know - because why ruin a story?": "David",

  "I would like to sing for the Pope. And the Queen, and at Simon Cowell's wedding.": "Jackie",

  "What an electric thrill it sends up and down the spine, how it sets the heart racing: A Royal Romance! A Royal Wedding! The pomp and the pageantry!": "Hamish",
  "All my tattoos except my first were not planned. I would just go into the shop late at night with friends and ask for something on the spot. My first is my parents' wedding date. I thought it would soften the blow of getting a tattoo.": "Hailey",
  "I had all kinds of fantasies, like a lot of girls, but did I actually go through the motions of planning a wedding and buying bridal magazines and imagining things and setting up who would play what role? No. Because as I grew up, I started to believe that I would be one of those gals that never got married.": "Sara",
  "The Queen's wedding dress in 1947, there was some embroidery on the train which was definitely there to illustrate new dawn/post-war optimism, that sort of thing.": "Kate",
  "Your wedding is your red carpet moment, and while brides definitely can take some chances with style, you don't want to look like a fad.": "Reem",
  "Hierarchical formulations died because their wedding cake levels posited a multiply fractured cosmos that does not match the Space Age revelation of a unified universe in which the earth is clearly in, rather than separated from, the heavens. Hierarchical representations do not reflect what either the world or we are like.": "Eugene",
  "I'm still waiting for someone to call me to cater their wedding. But that's gonna cost you. If you want my cousin Jerez to play the sax, that's going to cost you a little more. The sky's the limit after that.": "Coolio",
  "A wedding, people decide to get married, it comes out of such love for one another and then women can turn into these other people. They're planning something that's the biggest event they'll ever plan in their lives and it turns them into this other person, so it's not totally the guy's fault that he's feeling disconnected from this person.": "Alison",
  "I felt very unstressed on my wedding day. I'm very grateful for that... spending the day on my own, being super quiet and happy and just puttering around doing my own thing.": "Sonya",
  "When planning your wedding you make so many decisions: 'Do I want this fork or that fork?' But in the end people aren't going to remember what napkin holder you choose.": "Lara",
  "I don't know nothing about no marriages or nothing. I ain't even never been to a wedding.": "Mike",
  "I didn't finish my dress until about three days before my wedding - I had the flu and was stitching it from my bed. And the tulle came back from India all brown. We had to wash it for hours, but that didn't dissuade me from wearing it.": "Georgina",
  "Well the wedding in the words of the Archbishop of Canterbury was a fairy tale and there was a huge public impress, investment of goodwill, affection and indeed money in this Institution. It was a huge success at the time.": "Anthony",

  "I just went to a wedding of a friend of mine who happens to be gay. Because somebody doesn't think the way I do, doesn't mean that I can't care about them or can't love them.": "John",
  "The best thing I ever bought is a vintage Oscar de la Renta short gingham dress that I wore to my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding.": "Kelly",
  "Jody Hill, who I created 'Eastbound And Down' and 'Fist Foot Way' with, was my best man at my wedding.": "Danny",
  "I was never a girl who dreamed about what her wedding day would be like, but I've always dreamed about decorating my baby's nursery.": "Rebecca",
  "If I felt, in the event of a royal wedding, inspired to write about people coming together in marriage or civil partnership, I would just be grateful to have an idea for the poem. And if I didn't, I'd ignore it.": "Carol",
  "Ariel may look a lot like Barbie, and her adventure may be limited to romance and over with the wedding bells, but unlike, say, Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty, she's active, brave and determined, the heroine of her own life. She even rescues the prince. And that makes her a rare fish, indeed, in the world of preschool culture.": "Katha",
  "Sure, men like a challenge - but so do women. And nobody likes to be challenged all the time. I know plenty of long-standing happy couples who slept together right away, spent hours yakking on the phone, split checks down the middle, and lived together for years before the wedding.": "Katha",
  "Where does it stop? You get offered money for your wedding, then for your kids, new houses, holidays... We earn enough from football and sponsorships, why do you need any more?": "Ryan",
  "A lawyer I once knew told me of a strange case, a suffragette who had never married. After her death, he opened her trunk and discovered 50 wedding gowns.": "Marguerite",
  "There's no scenario in which I wouldn't want my entire family at a wedding.": "Jordan",
  "I wasn't always overweight. I was a skinny little punk of a kid with severe asthma. When I got married at the age of 22, I wore a cut-down size eight wedding gown.": "Mary",
  "As a pastor, you get invited into the most poignant moments of people's lives. Whether it's a wedding or a funeral or a hospital visit, you get invited into the center of the event, whether or not you know the people.": "Rob",
  "People always complain, 'you never invited me to your wedding', but I prefer casual weddings.": "Sinead",
  "I've worn a dress at my wedding. I've worn 6-inch Louboutins. I've got no fear and no shame.": "A.",
  "I'm the person who will go to a wedding and switch the place cards around because I don't want to sit next to someone I don't know, because I'm so bad at chatting to strangers.": "Sharon",
  "Me and the Dap-Kings, the whole band is playing a wedding band in 'The Wolf of Wall Street.'": "Sharon",
  "I worked a lot with Nick Knight and John Galliano when John was at Dior. He also made my wedding dress. He'll always hold a special place; I have most of my memorable, iconic moments in fashion with him.": "Liberty",
  "I think my first experience of art, or the joy in making art, was playing the horn at some high-school dance or bar mitzvah or wedding, looking at a roomful of people moving their bodies around in time to what I was doing. There was a piano player, a bass player, a drummer, and my breath making the melody.": "Robert",
  "I want the big drama. I always said I don't want a wedding I want a parade.": "Star",
  "I really was about to pass out during my entire wedding. I just didn't know if I could marry anybody.": "Patricia",

  "A walk through the storage facility of the community museum where I worked might easily have convinced you that people in the past wore only wedding dresses, carried silver candlesticks, and played with porcelain dolls.": "Susanna",
  "People didn't just wear wedding dresses in the past. They also wore plain cotton shifts beneath them. As pretty as the dresses might be, and as lovely as they might look on display, if a museum doesn't hang the shifts beside them or acknowledge that the shifts existed, that exhibit's incomplete.": "Susanna",
  "I had a 2-week courtship with a fellow student in the fiction workshop in Iowa and a 5-minute wedding in a lawyer's office above the coffee shop where we'd been having lunch that day. And so I sent a cable to my father saying, 'By the time you get this, Daddy, I'll already be Mrs. Blaise!'": "Bharati",
  "On my wedding day, I gifted my wife a platinum ring.": "Vijender",
  "I only did karaoke once in my life. It was with Courtney Love and it was a total disaster. She pulled me on stage in front of 500 people at a wedding. I'd never done karaoke before.": "Jared",

  "It happened in Miami, in Coral Gables, a great big ol' Cuban wedding. It was pretty intense.": "Jon",
  "I try to study the background of the country I am in and what were my hits there, so I can at least give them some of what they want. It's like a wedding - give them something old, something new, something borrowed and definitely something blue!": "Betty",
  "I met Kanye. I'm starstruck, man, but I stayed away from that guy. I didn't want him to go on a rant, go off on me. He did it at his wedding.": "Jay",
  "Since the day Brahma created the world to this day, no one's ever been able to satisfy a wedding guest. They always find some opportunity or other to find fault and criticise. One who can't even afford a dry piece of bread at home becomes a lord at the wedding party.": "Munshi",
  "I want John Legend to sing at my wedding.": "Sloane",
  "After I had the Caesarean, I was told I had really strong stomach muscles and so would heal very quickly. And I did. I was up walking about within three hours. Six days after having her, I was out shopping and shortly after that I made it to David Walliams' wedding.": "Denise",
  "'That's What She Said' is not Hollywood's standard picture of women: preternaturally gorgeous, wedding obsessed, boy crazy, fashion focused, sexed up 'girl' women. These are real women, comically portrayed, who are trying to wrestle with the very expectations of womanhood that Hollywood movies set up.": "Carrie",
  "I got my first big paycheck for 'My Best Friend's Wedding.' This was in the days when you actually did get paid to have a supporting role. It just doesn't happen like that anymore, but this was in the '90s. It was the golden age!": "Carrie",
  "My husband and I click wedding rings sometimes and say, 'By the power of the Castle of Greyskull!'": "Tamora",
  "For a girl, the wedding is when you're married. For a guy, it's when you get engaged. It takes a real aggressive human being to back out between the ring and the wedding.": "Max",
  "We all went to Kelsey's wedding, and yeah, we go to parties. We also go to each other's house. A group of us got together over at Kelsey's and just read through some plays just for the fun of it. That may not be everyone's idea of a good time, but we had a good time.": "David",

  "Onassis told me. He begged me to come to the wedding.": "Lee",
  "When I was in high school, there was 'Superbad' and 'The Girl Next Door' and 'Wedding Crashers' and all these great movies. You hope to be a part of something that's smart, funny and in that Todd Phillips-vein. You want to make something like 'Superbad.' That movie was so good and so funny.": "Miles",
  "When he came back from downtown, he had forgotten to bring his license, his identification, the $2 for the wedding license. So we got married two days later.": "Eydie",
  "The vibe of my wedding is kind of going to be ethereal. Simple and modern, in a way, but with a lot of greenery. So, eucalyptus, olive branches, moss, and candles - it's going to be very... I want it to feel very comfortable, but obviously sleek.": "Sasha",
  "One time when somebody showed up in a wedding dress, but I never knew if it was a joke, or she was serious. She asked me to marry her. She was serious. It was pretty funny.": "Bryan",
  "I'll get pretty much everything the way I want it. I've always dreamed of a beach wedding.": "Nicole",
  "It was about 2012, 2013. I started from zero. Small fashion shows, small photoshoots. I've seen a lot. I've seen a lot of things up close. I married my sister off; I gave jahez for her wedding. I tried to keep relations going with my family. I bought a house for them in Multan. My parents are settled in Multan; my house is there.": "Qandeel",
  "The first thing I ever saw Bradley Cooper in was 'Wedding Crashers.'": "Ed",
  "I don't follow trends. I make each cake for a particular wedding, or event.": "Ron",
  "When I celebrated my bar mitzvah, there was no cake. Today, there is no such thing as a bar mitzvah in the United States without a special cake. It can be even more complicated and expensive than a wedding cake, because bar-mitzvah cakes are often based on a particular theme.": "Ron",
  "Well... Actually I got picked because I was the only one who fit the wedding gown - they had my size.": "Kevin",
  "That to me was the most poignant part of Diana's wedding; as she was walking up the aisle and her eyes were going left to right, looking at people and smiling in the way that Diana did - and that diamond tiara glittering like mad. It was great.": "Bruce",
  "I'd hesitated to have a wedding because my gay and lesbian friends don't have that right.": "Kathy",
  "I love rings, but I can't wear them. I mean, look at my knuckles. My fingers and joints are so swollen from years of playing. That means no wedding band, either. Luckily, I have a very understanding wife.": "Justin",
  "My biggest blast-off hit was 'You Raise Me Up.' If you ever have a wedding or a funeral, it's a good pick.": "Josh",
  "If you write a song, and you go into a restaurant, and there's a guy with a piano singing and he's playing piano, singing your song, or you hear it at a wedding or at an airport... it's fun!": "Jesse",

  "I was a bridesmaid at a wedding in one picture.": "Dorothy",
  "I loved 'Monsoon Wedding' and 'Lunchbox' because they had 'real' stories. I wish there are more films made like them.": "Garth",
  "I used to work all the time, and now if there is a wedding, there's a concert, I'm there.": "Petra",

  "If you had asked me when I was 28 and in my wedding dress if I ever thought I would end up in my forties flipping my husband the bird over potato chips, I'd say you were crazy.": "Jenna",
  "It's not that I think weddings - or marriages - are letdowns. It's just that I want to see my wedding as one awesome achievement on a continuum of achievements, all of which were, in their way, just as beautiful and profound for having led me to the current one.": "Jessi",
  "I believe that anybody who gets married should go to a counselor for months before the wedding. I think that's going to save guys a lot of money and the ladies a lot of heartbreak.": "James",
  "There was a thing on Facebook that said, 'Describe George Clooney's wedding in three words,' and my answer was, 'Not invited again.'": "Michael",
  "It's important to still look like yourself on your wedding day, so I didn't do anything drastic.": "Lily",
  "We are all so close. We are godfather to each others' kids. I was the best man at Jesus' wedding.": "Juan",
  "I tried writing this book about a singer in a wedding band, but realized I only wanted to write the book so I could have an excuse to sing with a wedding band as research. That's not a good enough reason to write a book.": "Megan",
  "Of course, I do have a slight advantage over the rest of you. It helps in a pinch to be able to remind your bride that you gave up a throne for her.": "Edward",
  "You may invite the entire 35th Division to your wedding if you want to. I guess it's going to be yours as well as mine. We might as well have the church full while we are at it.": "Bess",
  "A lot of people think I'm that guy in 'Betsy's Wedding', but I'm not. What it is for me is that, on some level, I connect with the character emotionally.": "Anthony",
  "Sometimes, my books start with a scene I see in my mind, such as a woman in a wedding dress running away from her wedding like in 'Embers of Love.' Sometimes, a book can start with a character.": "Tracie",

  "Quarrels often arise in marriages when the bridal gifts are excessive.": "Antisthenes",
  "I've thought about it a hundred times. I even buy bridal magazines sometimes. I want David Tutera to do my wedding.": "Marlen",

  "I myself was a wedding photographer when I was, like, 16.": "Kacy",
  "Saw a wedding in the church. It was strange to see what delight we married people have to see these poor fools decoyed into our condition.": "Samuel",
  "The day of the wedding went like these things generally do, full of anxious moments interspersed with black comedy.": "Janet",
  "I'm taking one thing at a time. With the children and launching my solo career it would drive me to a nervous breakdown if I tried to organise a wedding on top of that.": "Natasha",
  "I went looking for dresses and realized there was a niche I could fill in the wedding dress market.": "Monique",
  "We rent one in three tuxedos in the U.S. and Canada, and if we make a mistake, our employees will deliver to the customer's home, office, or wedding. We get a couple hundred letters a week praising the service in our stores.": "George",

  "My five best friends, who were my bridesmaids in my wedding, are still my best friends.": "Jill",

  "On the night of the winter solstice, when the dead get their annual reprieve, they go up to the 24-hour donut shop and wedding chapel to get hitched. Marriage is a good and proper pursuit for dead people. For a while, it relieves the dark, shuddering loneliness of the afterlife.": "Rachel",

  "When the Internet first came into public use, it was hailed as a liberation from conformity, a floating world ruled by passion, creativity, innovation and freedom of information.

  "Hate speech and freedom of speech are two different things.": "Leslie",

  "My dad taught me from my youngest childhood memories through these connections with Aboriginal and tribal people that you must always protect people's sacred status, regardless of the past.": "Steve",
  "Simple. Pared down. Timeless. The ties were never too thick or too thin; the pants were never too flared or too skinny. In my life with Dad, he wore Western apparel because we went riding - jeans, cowboy boots, the turquoise belt buckle. But it was all very simple, and that classic look is very 'Ralph Lauren.'": "Jennifer",

  "Within our culture, every school has a swimming pool. We lived on the coast. People swam in the surf.

  "I was an all-sport athlete growing up. My dad, I think, hoped I would go to college on a scholarship.": "T.",

  "My brothers always like to believe that my father pampered me and I am spoilt. While it is not true, they felt that way. As for my dad, I could not do anything wrong. So, if I did something wrong, I would put the blame on them, and he would shout at them.": "Sonakshi",
  "To be able to have winning in your blood growing up, whether it was pounding my little brother or trying to beat my dad in something, or just competing on teams with my friends, it was nonstop.": "Jordan",
  "I was a pitcher, and my dad played in college. The hardest day of my life was telling him I was going to quit to focus more on golf. But with golf, I felt like the game can't be perfected, and that motivated me.": "Jordan",
  "My dad actually makes the best cookies. My mum is great baker, too, but doesn't share them - it's tantalising! Luckily for me though, my dad shares his!": "Blake",
  "With Dad, he was the ultimate wildlife warrior, and we admired him more than anything.": "Bindi",
  "I am a product of nepotism. I don't think I would have had the profession that I'm in currently... if it wasn't for my dad.": "Jeff",
  "Boxing's in my genes. I come from a fighting background. My dad and both my uncles were good boxers. I'm blessed with the art of war.": "Floyd",
  "My story starts with my dad, a black boy born to a single mother in a small town in North Carolina. It starts with my parents meeting in Washington, D.C., in the '60s, at a time of incredible activism.": "Cory",
  "Growing up, I was discouraged from telling personal stories. My dad often used the phrase 'Don't tell anyone.' But not about creepy things. I don't want to lead you down the wrong path. It would be about insignificant things. Like, I wouldn't make the soccer team, and my father would say, 'Don't tell anyone.'": "Mike",
  "Whenever I fail as a father or husband... a toy and a diamond always works.": "Shah",
  "My dad has always been really helpful. He taught me that talent is a bonus, but persistence is what wins out.": "Zosia",
  "My dad was the district attorney of New Orleans for about 30 years. And when he opened his campaign headquarters back in the early '70s, when I was 5 years old, my mother wanted me to play the national anthem. And they got an upright piano on the back of a flatbed truck and I played it.": "Harry",
  "I got stuck up a tree when I was about seven, and my dad had to come and get the ladder to get me down. I loved to climb all the way up to the top. I must have been a koala in my past life.": "Miranda",
  "Principles are the most important thing to me. One of the things I think my dad taught me was there are people who accept the world they live in and there are people who change the world they live in. I don't accept my circumstances.": "Ken",
  "My youngest son's pre-school class was recently asked what their dads do for work. The responses were things like, my dad sells money, and my dad figures stuff out. My son said, 'I've never seen my dad do work.' It's true. Skateboarding doesn't seem like real work, but I'm proud of what I do.": "Tony",
  "My dad used to say, 'Just be yourself and you'll be fine,' but it's really, really true.": "Bellamy",
  "I started traveling by myself as early as 5 to see my dad. I'd go to Toronto or Los Angeles, depending on what show he was doing, but most often New York, and we would hang out, and he'd take me to museums and Broadway plays. The ones that had the biggest impact on me were the George C. Wolfe productions.": "Mahershala",
  "I've never heard my dad say a bad word about anybody. He always keeps his emotions in check and is a true gentleman. I was taught that losing it was indulgent, a selfish act.": "Hugh",
  "My career choice is my career choice. Just stepping out of that zone, to be able to be a provider. I understand my position as a provider and my role as a dad also... Just being able to be comfortable with it.": "Future",
  "My dad is a motorcycle guy, not some Hollywood dude.": "Shia",
  "My dad always taught me never to give up in my mind. You can never really beat me. It sounds ridiculous, but I will always come back for you. You can't beat someone who never gives up. I could lose 100 times to you, but I will always get you. I will die trying. This applies not only to swimming but to my life as well.": "Chad",
  "I was always a kid trying to make a buck. I borrowed a dollar from my dad, went to the penny candy store, bought a dollar's worth of candy, set up my booth, and sold candy for five cents apiece. Ate half my inventory, made $2.50, gave my dad back his dollar.": "Guy",
  "My first outdoor cooking memories are full of erratic British summers, Dad swearing at a barbecue that he couldn't put together, and eventually eating charred sausages, feeling brilliant.": "Jamie",
  "My mum and dad aren't together, but she plays a massive part in my life. We have deep conversations: I tell her where I need support, where I feel she's lacking, and I support her with whatever she needs. I understand she won't be here forever, and I want no regrets.": "Anthony",
  "My Dad, a small-town lawyer, was also named Paul. Until we lost him when I was 16, he was a gentle presence in my life. I like to think he'd be proud of me and my sister and brothers, because I'm sure proud of him and of where I come from, Janesville, Wisconsin.": "Paul",
  "I didn't have any role models really. My best friend was a dog. My mum and dad saved a dog from the gutter and that dog was my brother before Jesse was born. Sami was his name and he was my role model.": "Ville",
  "Some of the happiest times I ever saw my dad was times when I was with him in the casinos, and he had a good night.": "James",
  "One of the things my dad and I got to bond over was going to the San Antonio Spurs games when Gervin was there, James Silas... I can't remember the rest of the guys' names, but it was a fun time.": "Shawn",
  "As a father now, I wouldn't do what my dad did, because it left me feeling emotionally unstable as a kid. But he didn't do the things he did out of selfishness or malice.": "Anthony",
  "I want to stay healthy, keep fit, eat well, keep a low profile and be a good dad.": "Frank",
  "One time, on Marine One, the president asked me my opinion. I had a flashback to being at the kitchen table with my dad. That dominant male figure set me up for being confident to express myself with precision and persuasion.": "Dana",
  "I do remember vividly sometime after puberty when I'd answer the phone at home and the callers began to say, 'Hi, Bill!' That's when I knew Dad and I had the same voice.": "Willie",
  "The biggest lesson I learned from my dad is to support children even if they're doing something that is unorthodox.": "Tony",
  "The worst advice I ever received from my dad was to play by the book.": "Dimebag",
  "Humans have voids, and you need things to fill voids... I didn't have a dad to fill that male model void, so when I heard Eminem or freaking seen Dave Chapelle, that's what I gravitated to.": "Tyler,",
  "My dad grew up in Banbridge, Northern Ireland, desperate to get to London. I grew up in London, so I don't know what it's like to yearn for the big city from a small town.": "Daniel",
  "Sons have always a rebellious wish to be disillusioned by that which charmed their fathers.": "Aldous",
  "I stopped loving my father a long time ago. What remained was the slavery to a pattern.": "Anais",
  "I am lucky to have had an attentive, curious and loving dad and heart-smart, down-to-earth, gifted mother. They changed the outlooks of their own lives and have never forgotten the people and organizations that helped them dream bigger than their circumstances should have allowed.": "Jennifer",
  "My dad liked to boil a squirrel head and suck the brains out the nose. Smaller than a chicken, bigger than a rat.": "Beth",
  "Ah, my dad's whistle. On holidays when I was a kid, we would all be off in the rock pools along the beach. When it came time to go, we'd hear the whistle and we'd all come running. Like dogs!": "Kate",
  "I will always do what I can to help others, but when I retire, I want to be a dad and a husband. I want a house and a dog in the yard. I want to have barbecues.": "J.",
  "I didn't know my dad for a long time. My dad was on drugs and my dad was at the VA Hospital, my dad was off in his own world selling drugs or using them or there would be crack heads in the house or whatever it would be.": "Shia",
  "I have to remind my dad, 'Journalists - no matter how many cigars they smoke with you - are not your friends, so don't talk to them.'": "Cameron",
  "My dad said to me growing up: 'When all is said and done, if you can count all your true friends on one hand, you're a lucky man.'": "Josh",
  "I was into the Mets because my Dad worked at IBM where he got free Mets tickets, so I was into the Mets... then I got to 'Saturday Night Live' where my boss has unbelievable N.Y. Yankees tickets, so he invites us to the games. I'm going to all the games, so I might as well root for the team I'm gonna go sit with.": "Jimmy",
  "My dad had an aunt at the turn of the century who died from diabetes, but she was the closest affected relative in my family.": "Bobby",
  "My mum was very conscious about fashion, and my dad was born into the tailoring tradition, so fashion has always been my life, although now, really, I wear the same thing - just in different weights - light and heavy cashmere in winter and cotton in summer. And jeans.": "Domenico",
  "I always joke that my kids' favorite holiday is Father's Day. They love the way I celebrate the occasion by writing each of them a thank-you letter and a generous check. It's my way of letting them know how much I appreciate the great pleasure and privilege of being their dad.": "Wayne",
  "My family always helped me. I had people around me who always pushed me to be the best: my dad, my mum. My dad used to play and coach as well. But I wasn't born with shiny things.": "Paul",
  "My dad has been a big influence on me, because he's always had his own business. He really taught me business sense and how to be a focused individual, but also how to have fun and make everyone around you have fun.": "Wiz",
  "On rare occasions, Dad used to reminisce about when he met Eisenhower and how Churchill would pop in, in the late hours of the evening or night, carrying a cigar, when he'd obviously had a good dinner.": "Ridley",
  "There's sometimes a weird benefit to having an alcoholic, violent father. He really motivated me in that I never wanted to be anything like him.": "Dean",
  "A father is always making his baby into a little woman. And when she is a woman he turns her back again.": "Enid",
  "I have never been a material girl. My father always told me never to love anything that cannot love you back.": "Imelda",
  "My father wants me to be like my brother, but I can't be.": "Robert",
  "Babies don't need fathers, but mothers do. Someone who is taking care of a baby needs to be taken care of.": "Amy",
  "I kept my babies fed. I could have dumped them, but I didn't. I decided that whatever trip I was on, they were going with me. You're looking at a real daddy.": "Barry",
  "I was punished for blowing the whistle on my father's lifestyle.": "Tatum",
  "When I was 18, I thought my father was pretty dumb. After a while when I got to be 21, I was amazed to find out how much he'd learned in three years.": "Frank",
  "Since I was a boy, from this house, I was out rescuing crocodiles and snakes. My mum and dad were very passionate about that and, I was lucky enough to go along.": "Steve",
  "Tiffany is very proud to have the last name and she's proud of her dad.": "Marla",
  "You know not having my real dad around and having a step dad made me want to be a great dad. So now I have been one for 9 years. And now 3 daughters. So, that is what I am - a dad, first and foremost, before anything else. It's just something that comes natural now.": "Tim",
  "I never saw any of my dad's stories. My mother said he had piles and piles of manuscripts.": "Stephen",
  "My dad saw my husband's boss at a conference, and he said to stop paying my husband until we produce children.": "Jenna",
  "I said, 'Ooh, Dad, I want the yellow ones.' He said, 'Where?' I said, 'Right there, Dad. I want the yellow ones.' Everybody goes, 'Those are green'. That's how I knew I was colorblind.": "Michael",
  "My dad never told me that when you audition, you might not get the role. He wanted to wait until my first disappointment to tell me.": "Haley",
  "I would have to say the person with whom I am most in love is definitely my son, Everly Bear. Although I'm his dad, I'm also his friend.": "Anthony",
  "My mother wanted to name me Jackie or Jacqueline but she got to name my sister and my brother, so my dad and my brother insisted on naming me. And they were big fans of 'The Little Mermaid.'": "Ariel",
  "My dad's a scratch golfer and I've got the knack of seeing something and then replicating it. I saw my dad swing a club and I worked out how to do the same thing. My backswing and follow-through have been basically the same since I was two.": "Rory",
  "Now I meditate twice a day for half an hour. In meditation, I can let go of everything. I'm not Hugh Jackman. I'm not a dad. I'm not a husband. I'm just dipping into that powerful source that creates everything. I take a little bath in it.": "Hugh",
  "If anybody had a reason to become a delinquent, to become a criminal, to be angry at the man, to be angry at the white man, to be angry at America, it's my dad, but he did not feel that way at all.": "Larry",
  "During the Depression, my dad made radios to sell to make extra money. Nobody had any money to buy the radios, so he would trade them for dogs. He built kennels in the backyard, and he cared for the dogs.": "Betty",
  "My mum was raised Jewish, my dad is very scientifically minded, and my school was vaguely Christian. We sang hymns in school. I liked the hymns bit, but apart from that, I can take it or leave it. So I had lots of different influences when I was younger.": "Ben",
  "Paul McCartney had a baby when he was 61; Rod Stewart was 66; Rupert Murdoch was a stunning 72. Not only does that mean they'll have less stamina than the average dad, that means they'll, well, check out a lot sooner too.": "Jeffrey",
  "My mother played the piano and my father the violin, I can remember my dad teaching me how to waltz; I had my feet on his, my mother playing the piano, and my husband will tell you the lessons weren't very successful.": "Quentin",
  "You draw the best things from your parents and family. You're going to pick up some of the bad things as well - there's a temper that runs through my dad's side of the family that I'm not especially keen on picking up a giant block of.": "Mark",
  "My dad's quite a conservative person, and he brought me up to be very questioning of the commercial world. He looked down on pop culture. I definitely got the impression that pop was evil and that Britney Spears was evil.": "Marina",
  "My mum and dad have always enjoyed life, and it's something that's been instilled in me. I wake up in a good mood most mornings.": "Rafe",
  "My mother was a very wonderful woman. When she and my dad divorced, she moved to California and worked two jobs in the cannery at night and as a waitress during the day. But she saved enough money to establish a restaurant.": "Dolores",
  "One of my dad's friends from the music industry came over to our house one time and heard me sing, and he said, 'She should audition for this role I have!' So I did! It was a movie called 'The Gospel,' which I did when I was five. That was when I was like, 'I want to do this acting thing!'": "China",
  "My dad was an assembly line worker at AC Spark Plug, which was a division of General Motors, and his job was to build and then inspect the little spark plugs as they came off the line.": "Michael",
  "I love my dad; I'm a daddy's girl, all the way.": "Molly",
  "God bless Dad, he came to every one of my shows. I was bad, and I had horrible stage fright. My dad was so relieved - he'd say, 'You were terrible; this kid is not going to be an actor.' Finally, I did a play and he said, 'Son - you were really good.'": "Kirk",
  "I remember my dad asking me one time, and it's something that has always stuck with me: 'Why not you, Russ?' You know, why not me? Why not me in the Super Bowl?": "Russell",
  "I used to play chess when I was a kid and participate in national-level tournaments with the geekiest guys. This one time, I was losing terribly, so I batted my eyelashes and flirted as I asked for a draw. My dad just couldn't believe it. He thought, 'What have I created, a floozy?' But it worked!": "Jordana",
  "My dad's cooking was magic in the kitchen. But eventually over the years, his personality changed and his ability to remember recipes failed. He became paranoid and thought people were stealing from him, when often he was just misplacing things.": "Tess",
  "Because my dad's Chinese-American, and they're very concrete, he said, 'There's no money to be made in literature.' So he told me to go into the sciences. And I was a good girl. And I did what Daddy said. And that's how I ended up being a doctor. But you know, you just can't stamp out that desire to tell stories.": "Tess",
  "I recall my dad saying about me once that the only time he'd ever heard me say 'never' was when I was asked if I'd had enough.": "Bob",
  "My dad always taught me to never be satisfied: to want more and know that what is done is done. That was his way of seeing the game. You've done it, now move on. People might say, 'Well, when can you enjoy it?' But it worked for me because, in the game, you need to be on your toes.": "Thierry",
  "I was obsessed with clowns. My dad had to get rid of them. I thought there were clowns under my bed for years.": "Haley",
  "I had one of the most outdoorsy childhoods you could imagine. I basically lived in the woods until I was 13. My dad and I built a huge treehouse in our backyard in Chesterfield, about 30 feet in the air. And we'd vacation on an island in Michigan, where I hunted a deer that we ate.": "Gabriel",
  "Wear what you want to wear. Do what you want to do. Be who you are. Pick out your own clothes. Be a man. And if that's too much to ask, as it almost always is for me, think of someone you consider to be a man and pretend to be like him. I pretend to be like my dad.": "Lyle",
  "I've seen fathers criticizing their sons the moment a game's over. Not my dad. It doesn't matter if I threw an interception or a Hail Mary, he always says, 'Good job, son, I'm proud of you.' Then he shakes my hand and gives me a hug. Every time.": "Ben",
  "My dad set a clear model for me for what manhood was all about.": "Cory",
  "M dad was a boxer, so he had this fierce, physical presence.": "Anthony",
  "I learned from my dad that change and experimentation are constants and important. You have to keep trying new things.": "S.",
  "I was looking for the meaning of life when I was in college. And my deal with my dad was as long as I was taking a full course load, then he would pay. And the times that I wasn't taking a full course load, then I was off the dole and I was working.": "John",
  "I've got the best parents you could ever ask for. My parents are from New Jersey, and they met in Vermont in college. My Dad grew up listening to heavy, psychedelic music. He's my biggest fan.": "King",
  "Every year, I give my dad an advance copy of my latest book. He reads it over the next several nights and says something incredibly supportive. Then he clears his throat nervously and changes the subject.": "Chelsea",
  "I promised my dad before he passed away that I would take care of the family.": "Luis",
  "One day we were sitting in our little classroom in the middle of Australia Zoo, and Dad bursts in and says, 'OK, today we're going to go climb a mountain,' - the Glass House Mountains are about 20 minutes away - so we packed up all our math work and ran out the door and climbed Mount Tibrogargan.": "Bindi",
  "There isn't a dude outside my dad who had greater influence on my life.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "Had my dad not been short and fat and balding, there's no doubt his career would have been very different. But he could do lots of stuff and made a very good career out of it. He had an incredible work ethic because he lost his father when he was very young, and the family had to pull together.": "Rory",
  "If my dad was alive, I wouldn't have gone to boarding school, and I wouldn't have had the success I've had.": "Jason",
  "I come from a very, very small town. There were no other actors around. I never met any actors. A lot of those times when I'd be out in the sheds with my dad, I'd step outside, and there's just nothing out there but thousands of acres, forty thousand sheep, and miles of nothing. And so my mind would just wonder about what else was out there.": "Jason",
  "I don't think it ever occurred to me that I wouldn't be an entrepreneur. My dad became a real estate developer, and that work is usually project-based. You attract investors for a project with a certain life cycle, and then you move on to the next thing. It's almost like being a serial entrepreneur, so I had that as an example.": "Stewart",
  "I do have an occasional temper - I sort of inherited my dad's short fuse.": "Princess",
  "I never grew up on Jodeci. I never grew up on things like that 'cause my dad was a preacher, and he kind of kept us away from music like that.": "Tory",
  "I'm definitely the super-cool dad.": "Ty",
  "When you're younger, you're trying to understand and make sense of what your parents are trying to instill in you, which is ultimately life experience. I remember being 17 and my dad trying to teach me the importance of responsibility.": "Jovan",
  "I went through a brief phase when I thought of other career options: being an air hostess and even a psychologist. But eventually, my destiny led me to acting. Moreover, my dad being an actor, I have grown up in a very filmi environment. I was encouraged to watch films since I was a child.": "Shraddha",
  "I've got a love affair with Harley-Davidson. One of my earliest photos with my dad is of him holding me as a baby on his bike.": "Jeffrey",
  "At my house, it's an, 'If dad says it, you can say it' kind of deal, so a lot of my slang words come off very childish at this point in my career.": "A.J.",
  "I have carried the burden of my dad's image since day one. They never see me as just another guy trying to make his career in the film industry. I am always 'Megastar' Chiranjeevi's son first, and Ram Charan only later.": "Ram",
  "My dad was always playing music. Not, like, playing music but listening to music.": "Post",
  "The most ironic thing is my grandfather has his masters in music composition; he was a jazz composer. My dad was a musician, too. He played more, like, soul music.": "Travis",
  "I was homeless for about 8 months, I refused to live with my dad or anyone for that matter. So I stayed somewhere that had no hot water, ever, no heat, I told myself I have to be strong and get through it on my own.": "Eric",
  "I was built up from my dad more than anyone else.": "John",
  "My dad farmed, my granddad was a farmer. I wanted to be a farmer.": "Sam",

  "My dad would always say, 'What can you do to make the world a better place?' Well, I can make people laugh.": "Jon",
  "My father came from a very poor background, but I was very fortunate in the sense that we were never in need. My dad was determined to make sure that we didn't want for things. He wanted to give us more opportunity than he had, a better shot at a better life.": "Brad",
  "I remember when I was younger. Dad's agent came round, and I asked if she would represent me. She didn't represent children at the time, but I wouldn't let her leave the house until she agreed. I've always been quite headstrong.": "Eleanor",
  "You can't be two people in your brain, one rock dude and a dad - there's something in the middle of them, and that's really what you are and that's going to make you the best dad - not when you try to be one or the other.": "Gerard",
  "Go on daddy-daughter dates and father-and-sons' outings with your children. As a family, go on campouts and picnics, to ball games and recitals, to school programs, and so forth. Having Dad there makes all the difference.": "Ezra",
  "I was probably a terrible husband, but I pride myself on being a good dad.": "Dwyane",
  "'The Simpsons' was about children and married parents; 'Futurama' is about people in between; they're growing up and haven't settled down. Every other cartoon show seemed to be, you know, dumb dad, bratty kids.": "Matt",
  "My dad was a composer and a musician, but he never finished high school. His formal education was rather minimal from the standards of today's college graduates and Ph.D.'s, but he had a deep interest in questions of science and questions of the universe.": "Brian",
  "My dad gave me the gene to enjoy cooking, and to enjoy consuming good food and wine.": "Danny",
  "I thank my dad for leaving me such a wonderful, wonderful heritage.": "Natalie",
  "I have a massive Samoan family. And the Samoan culture has always played a massive part of my life. I've got hundreds of family on my dad's side that live in Samoa and in New Zealand. I've just been surrounded by the culture ever since I was a kid.": "KJ",
  "Dad was an outstanding leader. He'd bring in top thinkers from a wide array of fields - how to fix the Detroit schools, for example. I watched him in these meetings. He listened and probed.": "Mitt",
  "When my dad founded our church, he used either a globe or a map of the world behind him. It was symbolic of what Christ said: to go forth and preach hope to the world. We believe in the cross, but we just continued with the globe.": "Joel",
  "My dad loves what I do and I support my parents financially because they didn't have a job that gave them a pension.": "Marilyn",
  "My dad never graduated high school. He was a printing salesman. We lived in a two-bedroom, one-bath house in St. Louis Park, Minnesota. We weren't rich - but we felt secure.": "Al",
  "OK, I have a nickname. My family calls me 'Trey' because I'm William the third. My dad has the same name, which is always confusing because my dad is well known, and I'm also known.": "Bill",
  "Me and my dad are the biggest promoters of an estate tax in the US. It's not a popular position.": "Bill",
  "People are always coming up to me and saying, 'I heard your dad's speech, and it's really great.' And they'll mention some place I didn't even know my dad was going to.": "Bill",
  "The only advantage to being a middle-aged man is that when you put on a jacket and tie, you're the Scary Dad. Never mind that no one has had an actually scary dad since 1966. The visceral fear remains.": "P.",
  "My dad had been born in Mexico and his family had to leave during the Mexican revolution.": "Mitt",
  "Because my dad abused me, I was determined to never let a man tell me what to do. God clearly showed me that I needed to be a submissive wife if I wanted to be effective in ministry. The truth is, if we don't learn to submit to authority, we won't ever learn to submit to God.": "Joyce",
  "My Dad used to tell us: 'En este pais, ustedes van a poder lograr todas las cosas que nosotros no pudimos' 'In this country, you will be able to accomplish all the things we never could.'": "Marco",
  "I remember one parent-teacher conference at the lower school, and Barack went, and there were SWAT guys on top of the roof of the school. And Malia was like, 'Dad, really? Really? Do they really have to be up there?' And it's like, yeah, honey, they do.": "Michelle",
  "My dad was fiscally conservative, and I was influenced by that. He didn't believe in spending more than you had because it gets you into trouble.": "Clint",
  "My dad was a big admirer of Sergeant York stories from the First World War.": "Clint",
  "Ask anyone on Social Security if their check comes on time every month. Like clockwork. And it comes through the so-called dilapidated U.S. mail. My dad's check literally will come on the same day every month. The government has been quite good and efficient at creating a number of systems.": "Michael",
  "I wanted to be a skinny little ballerina but I was a voluptuous little Italian girl whose dad had meatballs on the table every night.": "Lady",
  "I love my daddy. My daddy's everything. I hope I can find a man that will treat me as good as my dad.": "Lady",
  "Making your dad happy is - especially for an Italian Catholic girl, I'll tell you - it feels really good.": "Lady",
  "I made a decision when my father passed away that I was going to be who God made me to be and not try to preach like my father.": "Joel",

  "I think my dad has helped me tremendously.": "Rand",
  "My dad was one of only four congressmen who supported Reagan.": "Rand",

  "Working with my dad was such a gas. We approached the work in a similar way. We only made two films together when I was an adult, Tucker, and Blown Away, but it was so much fun to play with your parent like that.": "Jeff",
  "The first thing that pops into my mind when it comes to playing cowboys is my father, Lloyd Bridges. When I was a little kid, I loved to dress up like a cowboy - put on the boots, hat, and walk around. He was in a lot of westerns, and my dad loved to ride.": "Jeff",
  "My dad was very much a struggling actor and spent more of his life as a postman, as a member of a tarmac firm, as a van driver.": "Kate",
  "Mum and Dad were very much friends and up for life. There was no anxiety for anything when I was growing up they just taught me to be me. ": "Kate",
  "My dad would give me $10, which is a lot of money when you're 9, to sing at church, on tables at restaurants, at family functions, just about anywhere.": "Katy",
  "My mother is very emotional as well, but my dad is more of the guts of the family. He was the main preacher, so he kind of had this little Pentecostal flair, but they are born-again.": "Katy",
  "My dad makes food with very few delicate flavours.": "Yotam",
  "Dad likes my food, but he probably thinks it's too busy. He is a wonderful cook but only uses three ingredients. My mum rips out my articles and makes my recipes.": "Yotam",
  "My dad was never married. He was kind of a rolling stone. But he was never disrespectful. At the same time, even though he had women in his life when I was a kid, there wasn't any consistency.": "Kevin",
  "My dad came from Cuba when he was a teenager not speaking English. And I grew up here speaking Spanglish. That's the world in which I grew up, and that's a world in which a lot of second generation immigrants find themselves.": "Ted",
  "My dad grew up with an avocado tree in his backyard. My entire family, my wife and daughters, they love avocado. I may well be allergic. It makes me physically sick.": "Ted",
  "This is going to sound horrible, but I don't even know how much I make in a year. It must be, you know, a couple of million dollars, a few million. I know it's more money than my dad, a jail guard, made in his lifetime; more money than I'll ever need.": "Penn",
  "I'm very at ease, and I like it. I never thought I would be such a family-oriented guy; I didn't think that was part of my makeup. But somebody said that as you get older you become the person you always should have been, and I feel that's happening to me. I'm rather surprised at who I am, because I'm actually like my dad!": "David",
  "And I saw the sax line-up that he had behind him and I thought, I'm going to learn the saxophone. When I grow up, I'm going to play in his band. So I sort of persuaded my dad to get me a kind of a plastic saxophone on the hire purchase plan.": "David",
  "My dad would go to work every day and write in a room full of funny people. He enjoyed it. I know great writers who find the process agonising but to me, writing has always been sheer joy.": "Joss",
  "I have a son, but I've never had a daughter. I have a sister, and my sister had a fairly tempestuous relationship with my dad when she was young, and that was gripping and sometimes upsetting.": "Howard",
  "You don't want your children to look at you like you are anything special other than their dad.": "Martin",
  "I wasn't like a Fifties dad.": "Martin",
  "People are so used to seeing John Goodman as a lovable dad or the quirky characters he played in the Coen Brothers films.": "James",
  "People are so used to seeing John Goodman as a loveable dad or the quirky characters he played in the Coen Brothers films.": "James",
  "The place of the father in the modern suburban family is a very small one, particularly if he plays golf.": "Bertrand",
  "The fundamental defect of fathers, in our competitive society, is that they want their children to be a credit to them.": "Bertrand",
  "I drove my mum and dad mad.": "Nicola",
  "My dad's been responsible for a lot of my issues.": "Steven",
  "I get that same queasy, nervous, thrilling feeling every time I go to work. That's never worn off since I was 12 years-old with my dad's 8-millimeter movie camera.": "Steven",
  "My dad took me to my first movie. It was 'The Greatest Show on Earth' in 1952, a movie of such scale it was actually a traumatic experience.": "Steven",
  "I missed my dad a lot growing up, even though we were together as a family. My dad was really a workaholic. And he was always working.": "Steven",
  "Dad entered the Second World War like any other man, trying to do the right thing.": "Ridley",
  "I deal with my sons like young men. If they have a problem with something, they come to me. I am the type of dad that will drop everything I am doing for them, and always tell them to talk to me about it.": "Tracy",
  "My father was the role model I looked up to. My dad was an entertainer, too. I patterned my life after him. He wanted me to do better than he did. He never sold a record in his life, but to me, he was still a rock star.": "Tracy",
  "My dad was good with actions.": "William",
  "My dad died of a stroke.": "William",
  "Attraction doesn't stop when a child is born. It's the opposite. Being a mum and dad makes you even sexier.": "Orlando",
  "Think about finding out when you're 13 that your dad is not your dad. It's like, okay, take it on the chin and keep going. No choice, really.": "Orlando",
  "I was in the bath at the time, and my dad came running in and said, 'Guess who they want to play Harry Potter!?' and I started to cry. It was probably the best moment of my life.": "Daniel",
  "My dad's got a brilliant eye for scripts 'cos he's a literary agent. He and my agent read a load of scripts and filter them.": "Daniel",
  "When I was 13, I opened my own business called The Awesome Pretzel Company, and my dad helped me build a pretzel cart.": "Guy",
  "I think my dad is highly gender-neutral. If he doesn't like someone, he'll articulate that, and I think it's also part of what resonates about him. He'll say what he's thinking.": "Ivanka",
  "It was my dad's idea to change my name from Sahatciu to Ora. He said it would be easier to pronounce.": "Rita",
  "My mum and my dad are the sweetest couple.": "Rita",
  "My dad wanted me to go down a more academic route. He is very much about sticking to the rule book and sticking to the blueprint of a successful career.": "Rita",
  "I love eating at my dad's pub, the Queens Arms in Kilburn. It does a traditional Albanian spinach pie.": "Rita",
  "My dad took on every job he could get. He worked like mad. But then, at some point, he had saved up enough to open his first pub.": "Rita",
  "I've been going to Bicester Village since I was young. My mum and dad really loved that place, and I always used to stock up on clothes. I love the fact that it supports great British designers.": "Rita",
  "Now my dad is with me, traveling with me and a big part of this whole thing is I like to mix it up a little bit, you know. Who gets to take their father on a private jet across the country and stay in first class hotels? So we're enjoying it, but I'd stop if it's not possible.": "Shia",
  "I don't know, I just want to be happy. I could be in a hole somewhere. Or I could completely lose it and be some hippy living in the woods with my dad.": "Shia",
  "I'm not great at dealing with death, I have to say. I find death very hard: my mum, my dad, Sid Vicious. I'm not a monster; I feel it and it scares me. One death at a time, please, is all my heart will bear.": "John",
  "I truly think comedy is - being funny is DNA. My dad was a doctor, a wonderful doctor, and people still come up to me today, 'Your father helped my mother die.' You know what I'm saying? He made her laugh 'til she died. My father was always very funny.": "Joan",
  "I stayed in Baghdad every summer until I was 14. My dad's sister is still there, but many of my relatives have managed to get out. People forget that there are still people there who are not radicalized in any particular direction, trying to live normal lives in a very difficult situation.": "Andy",
  "My mother had very humble beginnings - to put it mildly. Her dad built their home out of timber that he cut down on their land. No heat, no air-conditioning - 'no foolishness,' as he would call it.": "Blake",
  "My dad was an English professor.": "Blake",
  "Great dad. Yeah, he would ask me for money on birthdays and, you know, inappropriate times. And I just wrote him off like, 'You're not a father.' I just learned you cannot emotionally invest in people who are not attainable.": "Drew",
  "I used to do bell ringing in Benenden church. It was really good fun, actually. My best friend's dad was the local vicar, and so it was expected as her best friend that I would go to church every Sunday with her.": "Jo",
  "My dad's a very sensitive man, but as the archetypal rebellious teenager, I didn't realise that.": "Jo",
  "My mum is bright, ambitious, well read, political and very bolshie: when my dad was conscripted into the Army and posted to Libya, she convinced some general to let her go with him. I don't know how she managed it.": "Jo",
  "It wasn't like I was self-motivated. My dad started me. It was his dream before it was mine.": "Venus",
  "I'm always on the court with my dad.": "Venus",
  "My dad loves to eat, and he loves everything I make!": "Venus",
  "My views about God come from my dad. Dad told me that he believed Nature, which to him included humankind, to be so beautiful, so magnificent, that there had to be something behind it all.": "Al",
  "My parents didn't make a lot of money. My dad was not a high school graduate - he didn't have a career as such he was a printing salesman essentially for most of his working life. ": "Al",
  "My dad loved comedians, especially George Jessel, and he loved Henny Youngman and Buddy Hackett.": "Al",
  "My dad was a terrible businessman.": "Al",
  "My dad is an attorney. I've always been interested in it. My sons are probably going to law school.": "Rob",
  "A kid is something precious, and you want to protect it and keep it fun. I'm not a dad, but I've seen people and how they behave with their kids.": "Jason",
  "When I was growing up, my dad didn't have weights, so he made himself a weight bench. Instead of a hand-me-down jacket, it was a hand-me-down weight bench.": "Jason",
  "The physical DNA has always been part of our family. My dad was a good boxer and gymnast; my mum is a ballroom dancer, and my brother does martial arts.": "Jason",
  "I remember tap-dancing and singing in front of the TV when I was a kid, telling my dad to stop watching Ed Sullivan or Milton Berle and watch me.": "Andie",
  "In my heart, I'm just a kid from the council houses. I can remember the old cottage and my dad coming round with the tin bath. I'm not a rich man.": "Terry",
  "Mickey Rourke's character in 'The Wrestler' - that was my dad, that was my uncles, that was so many members of my family. It was the only thing they knew. And then they would end up wrestling for a hundred bucks, go to autograph signings for two hundred bucks.": "Dwayne",
  "When I was a kid at four years old, that's when I started amateur wrestling with my dad and family. And when that's instilled in you, it never goes away.": "Dwayne",
  "I had a very strict upbringing with my dad and was very close to my mum, who was extremely loving.": "Tori",
  "I love my dad. There is no doubt about that. He is a wonderful man and a good person. Like many father/son relationships, we have our struggles, our misunderstandings, and our miscommunications. We are very different people, but also very similar at the same time.": "Brad",
  "I would say the dumbest thing I have heard is that my dad isn't my real dad.": "Khloe",
  "If your dad died before you were born, yeah, it hurts - but it's not like you had a connection with something that was real. Not to say it's any better - but to have that connection and then have it ripped away was, like, the worst. My dad was such a good dad that when he left, he left a huge scar. He was my superhero.": "Jay-Z",
  "My dad was president of the volunteer fire department, which was within walking distance to our house. I spent several days of each week there with him - any time the whistle blew, he went. It was truly inspiring to watch him lead that way.": "Brad",
  "My dad was a preacher.": "Matthew",
  "My dad always used to encourage me to dress weird.": "Charli",
  "My career plan at this point is 'Ice Age 5' through '10,' and even '12,' and 'Spider Man' - you know, basically I'd be Emma Stone's dad for the rest of my career. I really don't have any problem doing that.": "Denis",
  "My grandmother was an actress too. In the thirties and forties she was under contract with Universal Studios. Crazy credits, lots of them. My dad was also under contract with Universal Studios. And my first film was shot on the same stage they both worked on at Universal.": "Chris",
  "I think my dad is the only Arabic descendent who is an unsuccessful businessman.": "Shakira",
  "At the age of eight, I discovered that I could write songs. My dad used to take them to the notary and register them so that nobody could steal them from me.": "Shakira",
  "The thing is, my dad's always been more of a bookworm; he was interested in more intellectual pursuits, but nobody can escape the passion that football stirs.": "Shakira",
  "I adore my dad. He's a 78-year-old man and my inspiration.": "Shakira",
  "My dad was a slightly stricter version of Richard Dawkins. The worldview was that there are idiots out there who believe in Santa Claus and fairies and magic and elves, and we're not joining that nonsense.": "Alain",
  "My favorite thing about 'Saturday Night's Main Event,' it was that one time where I could stay up late with my dad and four brothers, and we would all beat the tar out of each other while the show was on, and it was all okay because my dad was a wrestling fan.": "John",
  "When I was a boy, my own dad told me in a smiling and wistful way that it's a wise man that knows his own father.": "Michael",
  "My dad and I are best friends. He's pretty much responsible for the way I turned out. He would provide a little artistic inspiration here and there in the form of a guitar, stuff like that.": "Trent",
  "My dad is an egomaniac.": "Sia",
  "What I think is remarkable about my mum and dad is they had no interest in films, really. None.": "Peter",
  "My dad always told me that the principal reason he chose New Zealand to emigrate to after World War II was the high regard his father had for the Kiwis he encountered at Gallipoli.": "Peter",
  "My dad goes through war novels like I go through boxes of Cinnamon Toast Crunch.": "Mike",
  "All the learnin' my father paid for was a bit o' birch at one end and an alphabet at the other.": "George",
  "I know that my dad not being in my life made a huge impact on me.": "Christina",
  "When I was about 12 years old back in Houston, my Dad used to take us to the driving range.": "Ron",
  "My dad believed in scaring us as we were growing up. Scaring the boys who wanted to date us more.": "Karin",
  "I busted my chin open trying to be Evel Knievel on my bike. When it happened, you could see straight through to the bone, I thought my dad was going to pass out. It left a scar that I still have now.": "Karin",
  "If you're a girl, you're always Daddy's little girl. You're vulnerable, no matter how worldly or sophisticated or strong you'd become along the way. My dad Lionel let me know how proud he was, even as he kept me from being too big for my britches.": "Donna",
  "Our public portrayal of fathers has shifted during my life. TV fathers have 'evolved' from real people like Sheriff Andy Taylor, Beaver's dad Ward Cleaver and Heathcliff 'Cliff' Huxtable, to cartoon dads like Homer Simpson and Seth MacFarlane's caricatures in 'American Dad!' and 'Family Guy.'": "Donna",
  "I have to say that my dad's face is very malleable. He's barely got any cartilage in his face. I think I maybe inherited that Play-Doh-like physicality from him.": "Claire",
  "When I was 13, I had my first job with my dad carrying shingles up to the roof. And then I got a job washing dishes at a restaurant. And then I got a job in a grocery store deli. And then I got a job in a factory sweeping Cheerio dust off the ground.": "Ashton",
  "My dad was young; he went to work. But he'd been to war. He'd seen some of the world. It wasn't like he was going to be an extensive traveler or something. It didn't seem to be in his nature or in the nature of his parents or many of the folks in my family, really.": "Bruce",
  "I think I created my particular stage persona out of my dad's life, and perhaps I even built it to suit him to some degree.": "Bruce",
  "Once, I was coming back from school, and there was this guy who was eve-teasing me and my friend. I had a Milton water bottle that I flung it at his face. My dad told me if you are in a crowded place and a guy eve-teases, you should make noise. I did exactly that and got people on the road to beat up the guy.": "Anushka",
  "My dad taught me to never be pigeonholed to really allow yourself to reinvent characters as they reinvent you to be bold and to be willing to play seemingly unlikeable people. ": "Laura",
  "My dad was always interested in characters he didn't understand - he was such a great bad guy in movies. And that is really the thing that calls me to the material often: something I struggle to understand in human behaviour.": "Laura",
  "To stay true to your art is such a complicated journey, and Dad clearly has done it.": "Laura",
  "I started school in public housing. My dad had a sixth-grade education.": "Rick",
  "I remember my dad working with me on breaking down my script and writing out a back story for my character and all that stuff.": "Jason",
  "My father was a writer/director/producer, so instead of throwing a ball around, our bonding was going to see movies. And at an early age, I knew if I wanted to impress my dad, it was not going to be by throwing a ball real far.": "Jason",
  "You, Dad, in the large scheme of things, don't matter. I, Dad, don't matter. We're vectors on the grids of cellular life.": "David",
  "I've always loved video games. I played 'Ms. Pac-man' with my dad, and I Ioved 'Galaga' and 'Tempest' and grew up on the standing arcade games. Even to this day, my dad will call me if he's playing 'Ms. Pac-man' and hold the phone up to the game.": "Aisha",
  "My dad, he was a construction worker. He was a butcher. He was a deep sea fisherman.": "Aisha",
  "I was raised by a single dad, and I've always kind of liked things that are typically more guy-oriented.": "Aisha",
  "I was raised by a single dad. Dad's idea of hanging out with your kid or day care was give her $20 in quarters, drop her at the arcade, and tell her not to talk to strangers.": "Aisha",
  "My dad was a big Frank Zappa fan, so I remember listening to a lot of Frank Zappa. Girls do not like Frank Zappa.": "Bill",
  "It's a complex relationship when your dad happened to be president and you are president and then you have all the amateur psychology that goes on when people try to speculate about motivations.": "Jeb",
  "I think my dad's post-presidency, he didn't miss a beat. He didn't get into any kind of 'Woe is me.' He dusted himself off and led an incredible life since 1993.": "Jeb",
  "I think it was hard at first for my dad to transition to being immobile.": "Jeb",
  "Shout-out to my dad - he influenced my style when I was 17.": "Theophilus",
  "I remember in the fifth grade my dad would take me to Manhattan to shop for clothes.": "Theophilus",
  "The first time I went to New York, I went with my first boyfriend, Clark. His dad had just bought an apartment in New York, and my dad dropped us off, and we were there for a week on our own. I must have been 15 or 16. I remember I went to Harlem and bought a goose jacket. That was the hip, hot thing.": "Kate",
  "My dad had a Vincent Black Shadow, which was a quite particular thing: it was the fastest cycle of its era... It sparked a world for me; when I was old enough, I got a motorcycle.": "Rachel",
  "I have my dad's shape. No booty.": "Queen",
  "All that really matters is I have two beautiful kids, and I'm trying to be the best dad I can possibly be, and that's the most important thing of all.": "Tiger",
  "When I started writing, I did have some idealised notion of my dad as a writer. But I have less and less of a literary rivalry with him as I've gone on. I certainly don't feel I need his approval, although maybe that's because I'm confident that I've got it.": "Paul",
  "Overcoming my dad telling me that I could never amount to anything is what has made me the megalomaniac that you see today.": "Bono",
  "I'm more comfortable with whatever's wrong with me than my father was whenever he felt he failed or didn't measure up to the standard he set.": "John",
  "When I was little, my dad used to call me 'Bandarella,' because I was a mess - a Bandar is a monkey in Hindi. I was not a girly-girl and would always break something and would be running around and didn't really fit in.": "Priyanka",
  "My dad had a lot of bad luck. You could see his suffering, his terrible suffering, living a life that was disappointing and looking for another one.": "Sam",
  "My old man tried to force on me a notion of what it was to be a 'man.' And it destroyed my dad.": "Sam",
  "People have told me, 'My dad passed on, but I have great memories of watching your shows with him.' It doesn't get any better than that.": "Bob",
  "My dad died of a heart attack when I was 15. I was bullied mercilessly in middle school. I went through a divorce - those not-so-great things are all a part of me, and they give me a place to go when I cover those stories on the news. I'm more empathetic, more relatable because of them.": "Megyn",
  "My dad always said that hard work beats talent when talent doesn't work hard enough.": "Katee",
  "I didn't start sweating until I had children. That was one of the first things I realized when my daughter Violet was born - I started getting wicked BO. You know there's a difference between basketball BO and stress BO? This was definitely stress BO. Like, new dad BO.": "Dave",
  "My mother taught me what it is to have a sense of humour; my dad, who was a headmaster, everything you need to know about hard work. My dad is the most decent man you could come across.": "James",
  "I grew up upper-class. Private school. My dad had a Jaguar. We're African-American, and we work together as a family, so people assume we're like the Jacksons. But I didn't have parents using me to get out of a bad situation.": "Beyonce",
  "My dad was in the Second World War with General Patton. He won medals for bravery, but he came home quite damaged, so he was a handful. He told us some terrible stories, and I guess you'd say he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder.": "Jerry",
  "My dad designed houses and was an architect for many years.": "Nikki",
  "My dad was the way he was, but he also gave me a motto: never say die. Just to keep pushing and pushing, fighting until the end. He put it in my head that you're always going to fight, and you're always going to beat them.": "Jason",
  "My dad was a violent alcoholic. Really aggressive.": "Jason",
  "When you lose someone whose life was so extraordinary like my dad's, you have two options: You can curl up in a dark corner... or rise above it and dust yourself off and continue with their work. He will always be with me.": "Bindi",
  "I'm concerned a little bit with the culture of celebrating the fundraise. My dad taught me that when you borrow money it's the worst day of your life.": "Gary",
  "When I was three years old, my dad bought me my first drum set.": "Travis",
  "There is too much fathering going on just now and there is no doubt about it fathers are depressing.": "Gertrude",
  "My grandfather and my uncle both died from colorectal cancer, my dad almost died from it and I have the gene for it.": "Kareem",
  "I am very close to my brother Ramesh Babu. When my father was away for shootings, my brother would take care of me, and I am very close to him, and yes, Dad's always special. He used to call me and enquire about my film's progress. Whenever I deliver a hit, I can see a glow on my father's face.": "Mahesh",
  "My dad was a labour lawyer, and the ideas that I grew up with - bad management, bad capitalism, robber barons - when I applied this to my own life, I saw that we are all on both sides of the coin.": "David",
  "My dad was an immigrant kid and a Democrat and a Jew, and we didn't know any Republicans in our group. So I grew up Democratic. My dad was a labor lawyer - a very hardworking guy, a one-horse labor lawyer - and then I went to hippie college and lived in the bubble.": "David",
  "I was raised by free-spirited people, though my father gave me a very strong work ethic.": "Diane",
  "My greatest dream is to work with my dad someday as an actress.": "Bryce",
  "My dad made a film called 'Willow' when he was a young filmmaker, which screened at the Cannes film festival, and people were booing afterwards.": "Bryce",
  "I don't think my kids have to worry too much about me embarrassing them because that's not how I would want to grow up, with wacky dad showing up at school and performing for everyone.": "Steve",
  "My father was grounded, a very meat-and-potatoes man. He was a baker.": "Anthony",
  "My life is black and white and mixed. My mother's a Rastafarian, my dad was a short white guy - it's not an affectation. It's also the lives of millions of people throughout the world.": "Zadie",
  "I still love recording and still love the stage, but like my dad, I have the most fun when I am in front of that glorious orchestra or that kick-butt big band.": "Natalie",
  "My dad cut my hair once - I wanted a bob and he gave me a bowl cut. That was a tough few years.": "Alexa",
  "My dad has kind of been the standard for me, he played 16 years in the league, and since I've been in the league, every year that I go through and deal with the scratches, the bumps and bruises, just the grind that it is to go through one NBA season.": "Stephen",
  "But I have to be careful not to let the world dazzle me so much that I forget that I'm a husband and a father.": "Herbie",
  "I don't think I can boast about him. 'Hey, my dad is a British institution; he's done all these incredible things and I'm really proud of him.' There is a certain baggage that comes with that in England.": "Rebecca",
  "Everybody wanna be a super dad and the best dad ever, but sometimes, I'm just realizing that I'm not perfect.": "Future",
  "My mum is really fair and has blonde hair, and my dad is not dark, either.": "Amy",
  "Mum and Dad met campaigning on the Spanish civil war. Both were active peace campaigners. They died in 1986 and '87.": "Jeremy",
  "My dad takes care of me as a manager and as a dad. That's his job, you know, to take care of me. He has my best interests at heart.": "Jessica",
  "I went to see England against Switzerland at Wembley with my dad and brother, too. That was in 2008, Fabio Capello's first game in charge. Jermaine Jenas scored, and we won 2-1. I remember the national anthem was incredible. I sang it with pride - always do.": "Harry",
  "My dad was a truck driver, and from the time I was knee high to a grapevine, I was driving a truck.": "Johnny",
  "My dad was a truck driver. We all used to ride along with him. And the way he'd keep awake was to sing while he was going down the road. So we all joined in.": "Johnny",
  "I grew up in Birmingham, but my parents are originally from Barbados. My dad, Romeo, was a long-distance lorry driver, and my mother, Mayleen, worked in catering.": "David",
  "My dad turned me onto Peter Sellers as a kid. I loved the fact that he was a unique combination of being extremely subtle and over-the-top all at the same time, and that's a hard thing to do. I admire that.": "Will",
  "My dad got me a huge board when I was little. He loves to surf. He suited me up and sent me out on this huge wave. I went under, and when I came out and the board hit me in the face. So I said, I never wanted to do this again. I stayed away until I was 13.": "Shaun",
  "People say, 'You will be 30 years old; you're too old. You'll get your nose broke,' say dad's a pushy dad. You hear stupid things and put them out of your mind.": "Katie",
  "My dad's one true quest in life was for the Platonic ideal of peanut butter. And I remember one day he announced, with a look of utter transfiguration on his face, that he had found paradise on Earth in a jar with a yellow cap. And it was called Red Wing.": "Christopher",
  "My dad was a pastor, so we were in church all the time.": "Ben",
  "I remember taking my stabilisers off my bike with my dad in the back garden. It was a small little bike, and it was called Poppy, had balloons on it, and was purple.": "Lizzie",
  "Where I come from, you don't really talk about how much you're earning. Those things are private. My dad never told my mum how much he was earning. I'm certainly not going to tell the world. I'm doing well.": "Paul",
  "My dad was a particularly polite kind of guy, very courteous.": "Paul",
  "When I first joined SAG, there was another John Reilly. My dad was John Reilly, too, but growing up I was John John. Nobody in life calls me John C. It's more like, 'Hey you, Step Brother!'": "John",
  "I think I got into travelling because it was so not in my blood, so against my tendency to just stay put because my dad just hated going on holidays, because, as I've said in many essays, the thing that he hated more than anything else in life was spending money. And as soon as you leave your home, you're spending money.": "Geoff",
  "In Brazil, if you have a son, the first thing you give him is a football. That's the first gift - so my dad was no different.": "Diego",
  "It's weird, the idea of someone else playing my dad, but weirdly nice.": "Lily",
  "My dad is the nicest guy you'll ever meet, and the easiest going.": "Serena",
  "Feels good to try, but playing a father, I'm getting a little older. I see now that I'm taking it more serious and I do want that lifestyle.": "Adam",
  "My dad was a roofer when I was young. I believe he owned his own roofing company in Florida. And then he fell through a roof, broke his back. Permanently. I mean, he's not paralyzed or anything, but he's had to deal with pain for all of his life since then.": "Channing",
  "We came to Portland because there was a good alternative public school. Friends who lived there told me about it, and my son loved it. I left his dad and went to work slinging hash in a breakfast diner and working nights tending bar in a biker tavern.": "Katherine",
  "I love the comic opportunities that come up in the context of a father-son relationship.": "Harrison",
  "I wanted to be a forest ranger or a coal man. At a very early age, I knew I didn't want to do what my dad did, which was work in an office.": "Harrison",
  "When I was little, we had a Golden Book that had all these Disney characters in one portrait on the first page. My dad used to read from it every night. We'd play this game of find Pluto or find Donald Duck. He'd read us stories and do all the voices. Those are great memories.": "Danica",
  "But I honestly don't read critics. My dad reads absolutely everything ever written about me. He calls me up to read ecstatic reviews, but I always insist that I can't hear them. If you give value to the good reviews, you have to give value to the criticism.": "Fiona",
  "I grew up with a truck. My dad had one, so I like trucks.": "Lucas",
  "I have four shelves covered with journals that I've written. Dad and I are writing songs together. I've probably written 100 songs.": "Miley",
  "My parents are very hard working people who did everything they could for their children. I have two brothers and they worked dog hard to give us an education and provide us with the most comfortable life possible. My dad provided for his family daily. So, yes, that is definitely in my DNA.": "David",
  "My father, he was like the rock, the guy you went to with every problem.": "Gwyneth",
  "I feel my dad, I still feel his love, and I still love him. I would do anything to have him back, but half the reason that my life is good, has real, true value, is that he died. I would obviously rather have him alive, but he gave me so much in his death.": "Gwyneth",
  "I want to be a dad. That's floating to the top of my list. I think it's such an important thing. I'm at the age where everyone has kids, and I ask them, 'Is it like a puppy?' And they go, 'It's 10 times a puppy.'": "Jimmy",
  "An angry father is most cruel towards himself.": "Publilius",
  "I want my kids to see me as Dad, for God's sake, not a television personality.": "Gordon",
  "I think some of my darkness comes from my dad. There is definitely convict history on that side of the family, a lot of dodginess. But with the darkness can also come entrepreneurialism, genius traits.": "Rebel",
  "My dad worked two jobs and moved us to the suburbs, and just being a black person, I went through a lot of racism and being called names and being bullied every single day. And it was hard. I didn't have any friends.": "Sherri",
  "A dramatic thing, the first time you stand up to your dad.": "Lenny",
  "My dad was diagnosed with cancer, so we ended up burying him a year to the day that he was diagnosed.": "Seann",
  "Child-rearing is my main interest now. I'm a hands-on father.": "Sean",
  "I'm an ambassador for the Make-A-Wish Foundation, and one of the children, his wish was to go to the Emmys, so he's going to be my date, along with my husband, and my dad and his girlfriend. So we're going to have a really fun night and it's going to be really exciting. I'm really excited for him to experience that.": "Christina",
  "My dad studies and practices homeopathy and Ayurveda medicine. He's a strong believer in both honey and milk as forms of healing. Honey is the one food that does not die. It does not expire. Growing up, he'd always be mixing up almonds or turmeric or gram flower with milk to cure a cough or a cold.": "Rupi",
  "I was always embarrassed because my dad wore a suit and my mother wore flat pumps and a cozy jumper while my friends' parents were punks or hippies.": "Shirley",
  "'Dirt On My Boots' is a very different song. I heard the melody, and I heard the lyrics, and I heard the drive of that song. I totally related. It was kinda me when I was on my bulldozer working for my dad.": "Jon",
  "My dad was in the military, yeah. He was in the Air Force, and he was a doctor, so he would go places for six months here, and two years there. And I was home-schooled because I played the violin, and I did a lot of competitions.": "Felicia",
  "When I turned 11, my dad decorated a room at the Standard hotel in Los Angeles in a '60s, Austin Powers style. There was human bowling: You run inside a giant inflatable ball and try to knock down pins. To this day, adults say it was one of the craziest parties they've ever been to.": "Zoe",
  "I mean, my dad's a television producer, and I knew I could get a job as an assistant or a reader with one of his friends, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do.": "J.",
  "Mum and Dad sent us to a bilingual school, so we had half the lessons in English and half in French. But I remember being hugely lost.": "Rose",
  "We were brought up Protestant, and I went to church three times a day on a Sunday. My parents weren't Bible-bashers, but we all have a strong belief in God and a strong faith. We had a huge garden; our house was a bit like a scene from 'The Good Life.' I think Mam and Dad had it really hard, bringing up a big family on very little.": "Bonnie",
  "My father... had sharper eyes than the rest of our people.": "Chief",
  "I said something really stupid once. I told a friend that my mother was so beautiful, but my dad was ugly. My dad heard it and just laughed it off, but I felt guilty. It haunted me for years. I should never have said that.": "Gene",
  "They have had such a crazy life living with me as their dad. Not crazy but different from their friends.": "Sebastian",
  "Honestly, I was such a tomboy as a kid. People were taking from their mothers' closets - I was taking from my dad's closet. It was the '80s, so it wasn't terrible, but I was wearing my dad's dress shirts over jeans from the Gap.": "Lauren",
  "I pop gum. My parents get so annoyed with me. I know my dad wishes he never taught me how to do that.": "Hilary",
  "I watch political shows for a number of weeks in a row, and all I see are guys arguing with each other over issues I have no idea about. My brother, he loves war-torn places. My dad would always read the paper and tell me I should watch CNN, but I usually wind up watching 'Breaking Bad.'": "Norm",
  "My girls are great at making fun of Dad. They're never impressed with anything I do. I love that. I hope that never changes.": "Alex",
  "My dad took me for an audition once, to show me, 'OK, you want to be a child actor, this is what it's like.' I sang a folk song about donkeys on this West End stage with this big director, and there was a queue of 200 girls all singing 'Memory.' I was terrible. Terrible.": "Emilia",
  "My dad wanted to name me after Rainier Maria Rilke, the poet.": "Rainn",
  "The entertainment industry isn't a line of work encouraged in the Persian culture. When I called my dad to say I wanted to quit medicine, there was about three minutes of silence. I'm not sure he knew what to do with himself!": "Nazanin",
  "Watching your husband become a father is really sexy and wonderful.": "Cindy",
  "My dad works in child protection and he's spent many, many years in that line of work.": "Chris",
  "My dad talks about the times when we'd play backyard cricket: If I got bowled out, I'd just refuse to let go of the bat and swing it at anyone who tried to take it away from me. I like to think that's been tempered a bit over the years.": "Chris",
  "My dad shaped the footballing side of me, and Mum shaped me as a person. I've always been very close to her - we've only ever had one argument, and that was over something stupid when I was 13.": "Frank",
  "I went to my dad when I was 17 and said, 'I want to be a country music star.' Which every dad loves to hear. And he said, 'I want you to go to college.' So we had a discussion. And I'm pretty stubborn. I'm a lot like him. And he said, 'If you go to college and graduate, I'll pay your first six months of rent in Nashville.' So he bribed me.": "Eric",
  "You can't be the dad who takes your kid out after your wife has said, 'No ice cream,' buys the ice cream, and says, 'Don't tell your mother.' You teach the child to lie - and to disrespect the other parent.": "Howie",
  "And my dad drilled it in my head, you know, 'If you want it bad enough, and you're willing to make the sacrifices, you can do it. But first you have to believe in yourself.": "Jennie",
  "So my father was a person who never lied to me. If I had a question, he answered it. I knew a lot of things at a young age because I was intrigued.": "Nick",
  "My dad was the town drunk. Most of the time that's not so bad but New York City? ": "Henny",
  "My dad was my hero when I was a young boy. And then it's a toss-up between Han Solo, the New Zealand All Blacks Rugby team, and Marlon Brando.": "Martin",
  "There's a lot of research behind the scenes that you don't get to see, but I have an instinct that my dad nurtured from when I was born. I was very lucky then.": "Steve",
  "When I was little, I grew up in a place called Hertfordshire, which is just near London, but out in the country, and I visited Pakistan in the summers to go and see my family on my dad's side.": "Bat",
  "My dad used to draw these great cartoon figures. His dream was being a cartoonist, but he never achieved it, and it kind of broke my heart. I think part of my interest in art had to do with his yearning for something he could never have.": "Kathryn",
  "When we used to go to the car-wash where people would wipe the windows, my dad would go out and help them and then tip them as well, so I learned my empathy from my dad, and my mum is very empathetic too, but in a very stern way; she will always check my ego.": "Charlie",
  "The surprising thing about fatherhood was finding my inner mush. Now I want to share it with the world.": "Christopher",
  "To do a movie with someone like Tom Hanks that when you tell your dad, your dad knows who Tom Hanks is - it feels like you're finally giving back to your parents. It's like you've actually done something that they can recognize, and there's something in me that makes them super proud.": "Sarita",
  "My dad was in the army. World War II. He got his college education from the army. After World War II he became an insurance salesman. Really, I didn't know my dad very well. He and my mother split up after the war. I was raised by my maternal grandmother and grandfather, and by my mother.": "Al",
  "I'm a father. It isn't just my life any more. I don't want my kid finding bottles in the house or seeing his father completely smashed.": "Billie",
  "My dad always told me, 'I don't care what you do. Just aim to be the best at it. Even if it's the world's best window cleaner.'": "Bruce",
  "I used to have a silk dressing gown an uncle bought in Japan and when I came downstairs in it, my dad used to call me Davinia. There was never embarrassment about that kind of thing. My sister used to dress me up a lot. She thought I was a little doll.": "David",
  "I loved going to the Chiang Kai Shek Memorial in Taipei to watch all the old Chinese people doing tai chi and practicing kung fu. The monument was made of white marble, and it was beautiful. Sometimes my dad and I would practice with them.": "Jimmy",
  "The whole thing for me is that I did 'Full House' and 'America's Funniest Home Videos,' and I look like a dentist, and I'm a dad. Being known as a dirty comedian turned into this weird thing. It's people's image of me.": "Bob",
  "My dad always jokes that we should have a reality TV show because my friends and I pull crazy stunts, like putting Saran Wrap on the toilet.": "Sofia",
  "I grew up watching my dad be a singer, so it's something I've always been interested in.": "Sofia",
  "I like all the angels around because they protect me and my daughter. I mean, her Dad's an angel.": "Courtney",
  "My father never raised his hand to any one of his children, except in self-defense.": "Fred",
  "My dad is so unique in what he does. It's not like I'm taking a torch from him and doing his thing. I hope I've carried from him a little bit of a sense of irony, a little bit of a wink.": "Willie",
  "My dad said if you become a tennis professional just make sure you get into the top hundred, because you have to make a little bit of money. You make a living so you can pay your coaching and, you know, your travels.": "Roger",
  "All of my high school male teachers were WWII and/or Korean War veterans. They taught my brothers and me the value of service to our country and reinforced what our dad had shown us about the meaning of service.": "Oliver",
  "My dad is really just lazy. He has nothing, I feel, to offer this world.": "Sasha",
  "La Mancha is a very macho, chauvinistic society. I saw very clearly that my life had to be in Madrid, and I liberated myself from my mum and dad after high school.": "Pedro",
  "It is impossible to please all the world and one's father.": "Jean",
  "I've had some amazing people in my life. Look at my father - he came from a small fishing village of five hundred people and at six foot four with giant ears and a kind of very odd expression, thought he could be a movie star. So go figure, you know?": "Kiefer",
  "Between Prince and my dad's fusion-jazz records, I didn't have a choice in being funky.": "Patrick",
  "I look for strong people. I don't like people who'll say yes to everything I might bring up. I want people who can argue and disagree and have a point of view that's reflected in the magazine. My dad believed in the cult of personality. He brought great writers and columnists to 'The Standard.'": "Anna",
  "My dad would call me his Cuban princess because I had really dark olive skin because I was always in the sun; but I don't really go in the sun anymore, so that is why I am so white.": "Bella",
  "I don't think I have any guilt or embarrassment about any of the TV shows I watch. Maybe the fact that the shows I can watch over and over again are cartoons like 'Bob's Burgers' and 'American Dad' and 'Rick & Morty.'": "Ross",
  "Sometimes, being a single mother, I miss the freedom. I see my other friends with kids, and when they go out for a drink, it is the dad that stays in.": "Julia",
  "I'm going to take care of the man I'm with. I grew up in a household where my mum takes care of my dad - she cooks, she does everything - and that's the kind of girl I am.": "Nicole",
  "My dad and uncles were among the 125,000 proud black American volunteers who, throughout their entire lives, considered their decision to serve during WWII as their greatest honor.": "Burgess",
  "My dad always taught me to never be satisfied, to want more and know that what is done is done.": "Thierry",
  "To say that my dad pushed me is an understatement. I was never naturally drawn to football.": "Thierry",
  "I never saw my dad cry. My son saw me cry. My dad never told me he loved me, and consequently I told Scott I loved him every other minute. The point is, I'll make less mistakes than my dad, my sons hopefully will make less mistakes than me, and their sons will make less mistakes than their dads.": "James",
  "I've always liked telling stories. That probably came from my dad, who definitely had the gift of gab and who wove a kind of personal folklore about his youth - stories full of adventure and ghosts and wild antics.": "Cullen",
  "I would never have done what I'd done if I'd considered my father as somebody I wanted to please.": "Robert",
  "People who have not done their research on me do not know that I am European, born in Copenhagen, Denmark to an Italian father from Napoli and a mother from Alabama who was singing opera and went to Europe, met my dad, fell in love, and then moved back to Rome, where I was raised, between Rome and Hamburg.": "Giancarlo",
  "My parents have a ridiculous work ethic; my dad just works, works, works, works, works. I think it would be hard to find a guy who's logged more hours than that guy.": "Bill",
  "When I was a boy, I used to pull a big cross saw with my dad. He'd use his right hand, so I'd have to use my left.": "Joe",
  "When I was a teenager, I was an umpire for a competitive league for 8- to 9-year-olds. I was really bad at it because I didn't know all the rules, and all these kids were better athletes than me. I made a bad call, and this dad snapped on me. Then he dumped his trash from his cooler, and I had to kick him out of the stands.": "Adam",
  "If I took the 40 years of my dad talking to me about war and battles and taking me to battlefields and distilled it down into one question, it would probably be the idea of the necessary or unnecessary war.": "Suzanne",
  "What harsh judges fathers are to all young men!": "Terence",
  "Employee fathers need to step up to the plate and put their family needs on the table.": "James",
  "These things were happening in my life where I was like, 'Man, I wish my pops was here to see this.' I never had those thoughts before fame, when my life was just a regular life. I wasn't saying, 'I wish my dad could be around and see me working at Applebee's.'": "Kid",
  "My dad was an attorney. The last thing he ever thought about was clothes, and yet somehow he always looked good.": "Thom",
  "I was going to move to New York after college and had no interest in pilot season. I'd seen what happened on TV shows because of my dad, and I didn't want to open myself up to that. But 'Pretty Little Liars' had a very early audition, and my agents encouraged me to go even though I didn't think it would be my thing.": "Troian",
  "I like wearing my dad's sweaters because I knew that he wore them when he held me when I was a baby.": "Troian",
  "My Dad was my biggest supporter. He never put pressure on me.": "Bobby",
  "I just went off for two months traveling around Europe on a motorcycle and pretty much turned my phone off. I did 5,000 miles with my dad. We went through Holland, Germany, Austria, Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro, Italy... and then I did Spain and France by myself.": "Michael",
  "All I want to do is be a good dad, but I'm pretty bad at it.": "Jim",
  "I wanted to take up music, so my father bought me a blunt instrument. He told me to knock myself out.": "Jay",
  "My dad used to tell me, 'Look, son, opportunity does not come knocking.' It's usually running down the street, and you have to chase it down, you have to tackle it, and then you have to hang on to it.": "David",
  "Since I stayed in a colony where either one was an engineer or a scientist, everybody thought I would be a scientist. This was the expectation everybody had apart from my parents. Honestly, I, too, wanted to be a scientist. I think it was the way Dad would explain us scientific theories and concepts that made the subject more intriguing.": "Shreya",
  "One of my earliest memories is of my father carrying me in one arm with a picket sign in the other.": "Camryn",
  "Dad was the only adult male I ever trusted.": "Michael",
  "Because of my father, we are that Shining City on a Hill.": "Michael",
  "I have always thought of Walt Disney as my second father.": "Annette",
  "Aeneas carried his aged father on his back from the ruins of Troy and so do we all, whether we like it or not, perhaps even if we have never known them.": "Angela",
  "No, I never thought about my father's money as my money.": "Christie",
  "My father loved people, children and pets.": "Tony",
  "I was born and brought up in Liverpool with my clever little sister Jemma, who is 14 and wants to be a vet. My mum Jane is an administrator and my dad Peter is a taxi driver.": "Jennifer",
  "My father wouldn't get us a TV, he wouldn't allow a TV in the house.": "Janis",
  "I grew up in Greenwich Village. Dad was friends with John Lennon and Yoko Ono.": "Yancy",
  "I'm glad to have shown myself able to do other things rather than people thinking, 'Oh, he'll just do the same as his dad.' Dad was a brilliant actor, but it just so happened he was five foot five and a half, fat and bald.": "Rory",
  "I lost my dad way too early and it was agonisingly awful. I missed him so much and I hated knowing that I could never again pick up the phone to tell him about my day.": "Monica",
  "I grew up not liking my father very much. I never saw him cry. But he must have. Everybody cries.": "Charley",
  "I wanted my dad to be proud of me, and I fell into acting because there wasn't anything else I could do, and in it I found a discipline that I wanted to keep coming back to, that I love and I learn about every day.": "Tom",
  "I was always the new kid in school, I'm the kid from a broken family, I'm the kid who had no dad showing up at the father-son stuff, I'm the kid that was using food stamps at the grocery store.": "Dave",
  "My father taught me how to substitute realities.": "Mira",
  "When I was younger it was - you know, my dad dressed up in drag on 'Bosom Buddies.' And that was what I was having to deal with at the time. And then around the time that I was into college was when he became statue-worthy I guess you could say.": "Colin",
  "My dad is a much more flamboyant character than I am. I think that's why I couldn't see myself going into straight acting. I always just felt daft.": "Nina",
  "The script for 'In Good Company' was the first one I ever showed my dad.": "Topher",
  "Creativity runs across many categories in life, from the arts-and-crafts project a mum or dad does with their kids, to the bestselling author's manuscript, to the designs of the hairdresser, to the creations of the computer programming genius.": "Tabatha",
  "I didn't always want to be a dad.": "Liam",
  "I had to learn how to chop wood actually - I don't think my dad would have let me go chop wood in the backyard growing up.": "Jennifer",
  "Can I play a southern character? You betcha. Can I do the voice of Tourist Dad and Carnival Barker? Ya betcha. Can I do Fix-It Felix? Ya betcha. But I don't want to just play southern characters, so I hide it; I bury it. I tamp it down like a secret. Like a dirty little secret.": "Rob",
  "I'm being a dad and a good husband.": "Chad",
  "I'm a fun father, but not a good father. The hard decisions always went to my wife.": "John",
  "When it came to the stylish and graceful art of ballroom dancing, my dad was a king of the clubs, a prowling tiger and a wonderfully natural mover.": "Bruno",
  "My dad is a huge rock and roll lead guitar fan. I didn't even really know that until recently. Everything has to have a guitar solo in it.": "Slash",
  "My dad taught me true words you have to use in every relationship. Yes, baby.": "Star",
  "My father was the most rational and the most dispassionate of men.": "Simon",
  "I'm sure there was some part of his soul was intrinsically happy, but he probably had to go through some permutations to really get that to blossom. I'm sure Dad had his challenges, but I think that joy was there from the beginning and he had to find a way to make his life support that and express that.": "Jennifer",
  "I remember going on carriage rides with Dad when we'd visit. I think quiet L.A. suited him better, but he loved to see shows here, he loved to visit his friends in the Hamptons.": "Jennifer",
  "My brothers bullied me, so I cried a lot as a kid. It was the only defense I had. Telling them to stop wouldn't work. The crying would bring my dad. Dad was my cavalry.": "Steven",
  "But you know, my dad called me the laziest white kid he ever met. When I screamed back at him that he was putting down a race of people to call me lazy, his answer was that's not what he was doing, and that I was also the dumbest white kid he ever met.": "Norman",
  "I'm Bam Margera. And I feel like kicking my dad's butt all day today.": "Bam",
  "When you grow up on a dairy farm, cows don't take a day off. So you work every day and my dad always said, 'No one can outwork you.'": "Pat",
  "I haven't really decided to be an actor yet! I started doing plays when I was about 15 or 16. I only did it because my dad saw a bunch of pretty girls in a restaurant and he asked them where they came from and they said drama group. He said, 'Son, that is where you need to go.'": "Robert",
  "And in that time, I lost my dad and had kids of my own. It was like, OK, I get it now. I know what fatherhood is all about. And you look at your parents differently.": "Paul",
  "I look at my little girl and I wonder what she's going to be and what she's going to do and what is it that leads girls certain directions in life. I think a lot of that goes back to what kind of father they had, and so it makes me want to be the best dad I can possibly be.": "Jake",
  "As a little girl I used to daydream about my real father coming on a white horse to rescue me.": "Christine",
  "I could share an hour of warm camaraderie with Dad, then once I'd walked out the door, get the uncanny feeling I'd disappeared into the wings of his mind's stage, like a character no longer necessary to the ongoing story line.": "Ron",
  "Roman history was kind of unavoidable where I was growing up. It was everywhere - all the place names and ruins and forts. My dad's a history buff, and I spent a lot of time on Hadrian's Wall. I became fascinated by the idea of what was so terrifying up there that the Romans built a 60-mile long, 30ft high stone wall to keep it out?": "Neil",
  "I was the third son, and the family tradition was my dad always favored the oldest child.": "Fred",
  "Thirteen, 13 children, and I love - I love them all. And I think I've been a good father to all of them.": "Anthony",
  "When I stopped playing hockey and started acting, the last person I was going to ask for help was my dad. He's the king of being like, 'I don't know. It's good work if you can get it. Good luck.'": "Wyatt",
  "According to my parents, I just started drumming when I was two. I traveled with them from five to seven on the road, playing percussion. Between 8 and 12, my dad sort of prepared me by teaching me every aspect of road life.": "Questlove",
  "You've got to take the road you need to take, and only you can make that calculation. Not your dad, not your friend. You have to take it if you feel it instinctively.": "Charles",
  "A father's disappointment can be a very powerful tool.": "Michael",
  "As a kid growing up, I wanted the Allen Iverson shoes that came out, the Questions. My dad got them for me, so I was excited about that.": "Nate",
  "I was born in a hurricane in Pensacola, Florida... my dad was in the military, so we moved all over the place. But I consider myself a southerner from Louisiana. I've lived in Texas for most of my adult life.": "Kimberly",
  "I didn't want to play a lawyer. I didn't want to play a doctor. I didn't want to play a single dad. I wanted to do something I felt I could learn from, something that would be a challenge and something that would not dry up.": "William",
  "My dad is a really honest, hardworking, straight guy.": "Joe",
  "Out of all my friends, I believe I'm the only kid whose dad made us work to cut rebars; we laid bricks in construction sites and did other real work every summer for minimum wage. Our dad said that it's important in the future that when we tell people to dig a hole, that you personally know how long it will take to dig that hole.": "Eric",
  "I love my dad, although I'm definitely critical of him sometimes, like when his pants are too tight. But I love him so much and I try to be really supportive of him.": "Liv",
  "I can't remember a major league game where I could make eye contact with my dad. I kept wondering if he was going to yell at me for hanging a pitch or something.": "David",
  "My dad put up a great hoop in our front yard in our driveway. I was in Oregon, so I had to be out there in the rain. We didn't always have a gym to go to.": "Kevin",
  "I was lucky. A lot of people have that. People that don't tell you what you want to hear, but what's best for you. I was blessed with great friends. I was always blessed that way. My dad always kept good people around me. I just got lucky. Because of the spotlight you're in, people are scared to tell you otherwise.": "Kevin",
  "From my first dunk at 14 years old to my second NCAA Championship at the University of Tennessee, my intense training with my dad was always to credit.": "Candace",
  "Father told me that if I ever met a lady in a dress like yours, I must look her straight in the eyes.": "Prince",
  "I suppose not everyone has a dad who wrote a book saying he didn't believe in the Parliamentary road to socialism.": "Ed",
  "I want to know everything there is to know about Lewis and Clark. And I want to do the Sunday crossword in less than an hour. I want to be the best dad in the world. I want to play Richard II, and I want to win another Tony award.": "Robert",
  "And I remember leaving my place in L.A. and - my father is a big fight fan - and I said, 'Dad, I got a couple of days off and I'm getting ready to go to Houston to sign to fight Muhammad Ali.": "Wilt",
  "I remember opening my dad's closet and there were, like, 40 suits, every color of the rainbow, plaid and winter and summer. He had two jewelry boxes full of watches and lighters and cuff links. And just... he was that guy. He was probably unfulfilled in his life in many ways.": "Jon",
  "I don't think there's any real motivation for somebody to be a truck driver. Mine was simple; dad was a truck driver, I wanted to own one.": "Lindsay",
  "When I was a kid, I used to imagine animals running under my bed. I told my dad, and he solved the problem quickly. He cut the legs off the bed.": "Lou",
  "I'm a dad, and I can tell you it's the most beautiful thing in the world.": "Aaron",
  "Being a dad is like - there's nothing more important. So the exploration of that in stories, with parents and fathers and brothers, siblings, I just think that you're always in the terrain of love, whether it's absence of love or the giving of love or the desire for love.": "Gavin",
  "I was actually born in L.A. My sisters and I were playing in a parking lot, and my dad was like, 'Nah, nah, nah. Let's go give 'em some grass.'": "Rachel",
  "My father was something of a rainbow-chaser.": "Marc",

  "I am a forward-looking person and live in the moment to build for the future.": "Hugh",
  "I always read about these stories of entrepreneurs - it's like they're in the desert with no water, and they're the ones that survive.

  "Run to meet the future or it's going to run you down.": "Anthony",

  "What else does anxiety about the future bring you but sorrow upon sorrow?": "Thomas",
