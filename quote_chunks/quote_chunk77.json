  "THE KEY TO A WONDERFUL LIFEThe key to a wonderful lifeIs to never stop wandering into wonder.Because to live a predictable life,Only fills a person with strife,And such a person will always be wondering:'What a limitless life could be lived beyond the lines?'Such is a question a curious spirit would never sit and ponder.So always pursue new ventures in your life,And be willing to open doors to different light;This is the only way to keep it magical and always filled with wonder.Days will feel shorter, but your happiness will grow stronger --Because living a life without curiosity and adventure,Is a stale life where days only feel longer andLonger.Poetry by Suzy Kassem": "Suzy",

There he confounds the reason of the reasonable; there he aggravates our nature, our piety\u2014that is where he wants to be, and no one can keep him from it. Only the humble believe him and rejoice that God is so free and so marvelous that he does wonders where people despair, that he takes what is little and lowly and makes it marvelous. And that is the wonder of all wonders, that God loves the lowly\u2026. God is not ashamed of the lowliness of human beings. God marches right in.

  "Rarely do wonder tales end unhappily. They triumph over death. The tale begins with \"Once upon a time\" or \"Once there was\" and never really ends when it ends. The ending is actually the beginning. The once upon a time is not a past designation but futuristic: the timelessness of the tale and its lack of geographical specificity endow it with utopian connotations - \"utopia\" in its original meaning designated \"no place,\" a place that no one had ever envisaged. We form and keep the utopian kernel of the tale safe in our imaginations with hope.The significance of the paradigmatic functions of the wonder tale is that they facilitate recall for teller and listeners. They enable us to store, remember, and reproduce the utopian spirit of the tale and to change it to fit our experiences and desires, owing to the easily identifiable characters who are associated with particular assignments and settings ...The characters, settings, and motifs are combined and varied according to specific functions to induce wonder, It is this sense of wonder that distinguished the wonder tales from such other oral tales as the legend, the fable, the anecdote, and the myth; it is clearly the sense of wonder that distinguishes the literary fairy tale from the moral story, novella, sentimental tale, and other modern short literary genres. Wonder causes astonishment, and as manifested in a marvelous object or phenomenon, it is often regarded as a supernatural occurrence and can be an omen or a portent, It gives rise to admiration, fear, awe, and reverence. The Oxford Universal Dictionary states that wonder is \"the emotion excited by the perception of something novel and unexpected, or inexplicable; astonishment mingled with perplexity or bewildered curiosity.\" In the oral wonder tale, we are to wonder about the workings of the universe, where anything can happen at any time, and these happy or fortuitous events are never to be explained. Nor do the characters demand an explanation - they are opportunistic, are encouraged to be so, and if they do not take advantage of the opportunity that will benefit them in their relations with others, they are either dumb or mean-spirited. The tales seek to awaken our regard for the miraculous condition of life and to evoke in a religious sense profound feelings of awe and respect for life as a miraculous process, which can be altered and changed to compensate for the lack of power, wealth, and pleasure that is most people's lot. Lack, deprivation, prohibition, and interdiction motivate people to look for signs of fulfillment and emancipation. In the wonder tales, those who are naive and simple are able to succeed because they are untainted and can recognize the wondrous signs. They have retained their belief in the miraculous condition of nature, revere nature in all its aspects. They have hot been spoiled by conventionalism, power, or rationalism. In contrast to the humble characters, the villains are those who use words intentionally to exploit, control, transfix, incarcerate, and destroy for their benefit. They have no respect or consideration for nature and other human beings, and they actually seek to abuse magic by preventing change and causing everything to be transfixed according to their interests. Enchantment equals petrification. Breaking the spell equals emancipation. The wondrous protagonist wants to keep the process of natural change flowing and indicates possibilities for overcoming the obstacles that prevent other characters or creatures from living in a peaceful and pleasurable way.": "Jack",
  "Since these wonder tales have been with us for thousands of years and have undergone so many different changes in the oral tradition, it is difficult to determine the ideological intention of the narrator, and when we disregard the narrator's intention, it is often difficult to reconstruct (and/or deconstruct) the ideological meaning of a tale. In the last analysis, even if we cannot establish whether a wonder tale is ideologically conservative, sexist, progressive, emancipatory, etc., it is the celebration of wonder that constitutes its major appeal. No matter what the plot may be, this type of tale calls forth our capacity as readers and potential transmitters of its signs and meanings to wonder. We do not want to know the exact resolution, the \"happily ever after,\" of a tale - that is, what it is actually like. We do not want to name God, gods, goddesses, or fairies, who will forever remain mysterious and omnipotent. We do not want to form graven images. We do not want utopia designated for us. We want to remain curious, startled, provoked, mystified, and uplifted. We want to glare, gaze, gawk, behold, and stare. We want to be given opportunities to change, and ultimately we want to be told that we can become kings and queens, or lords of our own destinies. We remember wonder tales and fairy tales to keep our sense of wonderment alive and to nurture our hope that we can seize possibilities and opportunities to transform ourselves and our worlds.": "Jack",

  "The first finding that jumped out at us was that it is possible to learn too much ! In the tournament, investing lots of time in learning was not at all effective. In fact, we found a strong negative correlation between the proportion of a strategy's moves that were INNOVATE or OBSERVE, as opposed to EXPLOIT, and how well the strategy performed. Successful strategies spent only a small fraction of their time (5-10%) learning, and the bulk of their time caching in on what they had learned, through playing EXPLOIT. Only through playing EXPLOIT can a strategy directly accrue fitness. Hencem every time a strategy chooses to learn new behavior, be it through playing INNOVATE or OBSERVE, there is a cost corresponding to the payoff that would have been received had EXPLOIT been played instead. This implied that the way to get on in life was to do a very quick bit of learning and then EXPLOIT, EXPLOIT, EXPLOIT until you die. That is a sobering lesson for someone like myself who has spent his whole life in school or university.": "Kevin",

Push approaches are typified by \"programs\" - tightly scripted specifications of activities designed to be invoked by known parties in pre-determined contexts. Of course, we don't mean that all push approaches are software programs - we are using this as a broader metaphor to describe one way of organizing activities and resources. Think of thick process manuals in most enterprises or standardized curricula in most primary and secondary educational institutions, not to mention the programming of network television, and you will see that institutions heavily rely on programs of many types to deliver resources in pre-determined contexts.Pull approaches, in contrast, tend to be implemented on \"platforms\" designed to flexibly accommodate diverse providers and consumers of resources. These platforms are much more open-ended and designed to evolve based on the learning and changing needs of the participants. Once again, we do not mean to use platforms in the literal sense of a tangible foundation, but in a broader, metaphorical sense to describe frameworks for orchestrating a set of resources that can be configured quickly and easily to serve a broad range of needs.

Every time I went excavating, the stories turned out to be more complex, more heavily edited, and more ambiguous than I had first thought.

  "Rather than equating the terms 'local' and 'cosmopolitan' with geographical areas (rural and urban respectively), sociologist Wade Clark Roof suggests that these terms refer to character types who can be found in a diversity of settings in the United States. Locals are strongly oriented toward community or neighborhood, favor commitments to primary groups (family, neighborhood, fraternal and community organizations), tend to personalize their interpretations of social experience, and are more traditional in their beliefs and values. Cosmopolitans, on the other hand, are oriented toward the world outside the residential community, prefer membership in professional or special interest organizations, and are more open to social change and more tolerant of diversity in belief than locals. While a disproportionate number of locals are found in smaller communities, studies indicate that other factors - such as length of residence in a community, age, and educational level - play an even stronger role in determining orientation.": "Leonora",

How can we lay claim to making an open and friendly society where human rights are respected and fostered when, by the values we teach and foster, we systematically exclude segments of our population? I believe that those we most often exclude from the normal life of society, people with disabilities, have profound lessons to teach us.

  "Another site of Leftist struggle [other than Detroit] that has parallels to New Orleans: Palestine. From the central role of displacement to the ways in which culture and community serve as tools of resistance, there are illuminating comparisons to be made between these two otherwise very different places.In the New Orleans Black community, death is commemorated as a public ritual (it's often an occasion for a street party), and the deceased are often also memorialized on t-shirts featuring their photos embellished with designs that celebrate their lives. Worn by most of the deceased's friends and family, these t-shirts remind me of the martyr posters in Palestine, which also feature a photo and design to memorialize the person who has passed on. In Palestine, the poster's subjects are anyone who has been killed by the occupation, whether a sick child who died at a checkpoint or an armed fighter killed in combat. In New Orleans, anyone with family and friends can be memorialized on a t-shift. But a sad truth of life in poor communities is that too many of those celebrate on t-shirts lost their lives to violence. For both New Orleans and Palestine, outsiders often think that people have become so accustomed to death by violence that it has become trivialized by t-shirts and posters.While it's true that these traditions wouldn't manifest in these particular ways if either population had more opportunities for long lives and death from natural causes, it's also far from trivial to find ways to celebrate a life. Outsiders tend to demonize those killed--especially the young men--in both cultures as thugs, killers, or terrorists whose lives shouldn't be memorialized in this way, or at all. But the people carrying on these traditions emphasize that every person is a son or daughter of someone, and every death should be mourned, every life celebrated.": "Jordan",

The recently departed whose time on earth overlapped with people still here are the sasha, the living-dead. They are not wholly dead, for they still live in the memories of the living, who can call them to mind, create their likeness in art, and bring them to life in anecdote. When the last person to know an ancestor dies, that ancestor leaves the sasha for the zamani, the dead. As generalised ancestors, the zamani are not forgotten but revered.

  "I was finally beginning to perceive that no matter how many dead people I might see, or people at the instant of their death, I would never manage to grasp death, that very moment, precisely in itself. It was one thing or the other: either you are dead, and then in any case there's nothing else to understand, or else you are not yet dead, and in that case, even with the rifle at the back of your head or the rope around your neck, death remains incomprehensible, a pure abstraction, this absurd idea that I, the only living person in the world, could disappear.

  "One had heard and read a great deal about death, and even seen a little of it, and knew by heart the thousand commonplaces of religion and poetry which seemed to deaden one's senses and veil the horror. Society being immortal, could put on immortality at will. Adams being mortal, felt only the mortality. Death took features altogether new to him, in these rich and sensuous surroundings. Nature enjoyed it, played with it, the horror added to her charm, she liked the torture, and smothered her victim with caresses. Never had one seen her so winning. The hot Italian summer brooded outside, over the market-place and the picturesque peasants, and, in the singular color of the Tuscan atmosphere, the hills and vineyards of the Apennines seemed bursting with mid-summer blood. The sick-room itself glowed with the Italian joy of life; friends filled it; no harsh northern lights pierced the soft shadows; even the dying women shared the sense of the Italian summer, the soft, velvet air, the humor, the courage, the sensual fulness of Nature and man. She faced death, as women mostly do, bravely and even gaily, racked slowly to unconsciousness, but yielding only to violence, as a soldier sabred in battle. For many thousands of years, on these hills and plains, Nature had gone on sabring men and women with the same air of sensual pleasure.": "Henry",

He was going over the mountains, he'd said, to hunt for quail in willow canyons, he had no particular canyons in mind, he intended to return on Thursday evening, though possibly, if the hunting was good, he would return on Friday or Saturday.

  "Fran had from an unsuitably early age been attracted by the heroic death, the famous last words, the tragic farewell. Her parents had on their shelves a copy of Brewer's 'Dictionary of Phase and fable', a book which, as a teenager, she would morbidly browse for hours. One of her favourite sections was 'Dying Sayings', with its fine mix of the pious, the complacent, the apocryphal, the bathetic and the defiant. Artists had fared well: Beethoven was alleged to have said 'I shall hear in heaven'; the erotic painter Etty had declared 'Wonderful! Wonderful this death!'; and Keats had died bravely, generously comforting his poor friend Severn.Those about to be executed had clearly had time to prepare a fine last thought, and of these she favoured the romantic Walter Raleigh's, 'It matters little how the head lies, so the heart be right'. Harriet Martineau, who had suffered so much as a child from religion, as Fran had later discovered, had stoically remarked, 'I see no reason why the existence of Harriet Martineau should be perpetuated', an admirably composed sentiment which had caught the child Fran's attention long before she knew who Harriet Martineau was. But most of all she had liked the parting of Siward the Dane who had commended his men: 'Lift me up that I may die standing, not lying down like a cow'.": "Margaret",

The things that his death gave rise to are still there, bright and clear, inside me, some of them even clearer than when they were new. What I want to say is this: I'm going to turn twenty soon. Part of what Kizuki and I shared when we were sixteen and seventeen has already vanished, and no amount of crying is going to bring that back.

Regardless the human frailties of the recently departed, it seems that we should aspire to clutch the best part of our ancestors being fast to our hearts.

With dauntless spirit you continue to struggle. By infinitesimal degrees, the load becomes lighter and your confinement less.

You might have stood up to Stalin, you might still read Tolstoy, but if you're losing it from both the front and back and you're not a two-year-old, you're going to be hidden away. \"Don't know the nursing homes, they do a pretty good job,\" a geriatrician said to me.

To reduce non-communicable disease, the actions we need to take are societal: make it easier for people to move and eat well, strengthen education, promote community participation and meaningful work.

  "Last Comforts\u201d was born when one nagging question kept arising early in my journey as a hospice volunteer. Why were people coming into hospice care so late in the course of their illness? That question led to many others that rippled out beyond hospice care. Are there better alternatives to conventional skilled nursing home operations? How are physicians and nurses educated about advanced illness and end-of-life care? What are more effective ways of providing dementia care? What are the unique challenges of minority and LGBT people? What is the role of popular media in our death-denying culture? What has been the impact of public policy decisions about palliative and hospice care? \tThe book is part memoir of lessons learned throughout my experiences with patients and families as a hospice volunteer; part spotlight on the remarkable pathfinders and innovative programs in palliative and late-life care; and part call to action.

  "To be present at the time of death can be one of the most important moments in life. To see those last, awesome minutes of transition from life into death can only be described as a spiritual experience. And then afterwards, when the body lies still, one gets the strange feeling that the person has simply gone away, as though he has said, \u2018I\u2019m just going into the other room. I\u2019ll leave that thing there while I\u2019m gone; I won\u2019t be needing it.\u2019 It\u2019s a very odd experience \u2013 the body is there, but the person has gone. No one would say, \u2018I am a body\u2019; we say, \u2018I have a body\u2019. So what, therefore, is the \u2018I\u2019? The \u2018I\u2019 or perhaps \u2018me\u2019 has just stepped into the other room. It is a strange feeling, and I can\u2019t describe it in any other way. Another thing that is strange is that the body left behind looks smaller, quite a lot smaller, than the living person. The face looks the same, but calm and relaxed, wrinkles and worry lines are smoothed, and a feeling of serenity pervades the entire room. But the person, the \u2018I\u2019, has gone. It also greatly helps the process of mourning to see the body after death, and preferably to assist in the laying out.

  "I imagined my coffin being closed, and the screws being turned. I was immobile, but I was alive, and I wanted to tell my family that I was seeing everything. I wanted to tell them all that I loved them, but not a sound came out of my mouth. My father and mother were weeping, my wife and my friends were gathered around, but I was completely alone! With all of the people dear to me standing there, no one was able to see that I was alive and that I had not yet accomplished all that I wanted to do in this world. I tried desperately to open my eyes, to give a sign, to beat on the lid of the coffin. But I could not move any part of my body. I felt the coffin being carried toward the grave. I could hear the sound of the handles grinding against their fittings, the steps of those in the procession, and conversations from this side and that. Someone said that he had a date for dinner later on, and another observed that I had died early. The smell of flowers all around me began to suffocate me. I remembered how I had given up trying to establish a relationship with two or three women, fearing their rejection. I remembered also the number of times I had failed to do what I wanted to do, thinking I could always do it later. I felt very sorry for myself, not only because I was about to be buried alive but also because I had been afraid to live. Why be fearful of saying no to someone or of leaving something undone when the most important thing of all was to enjoy life fully? There I was, trapped in a coffin, and it was already too late to go back and show the courage I should have had. There I was, having played the role of my own Judas, having betrayed myself. There I was, powerless to move a muscle, screaming for help, while the others were involved in their lives, worrying about what they were going to do that night, admiring statues and buildings that I would never see again. I began to feel how unfair it was to have to be buried while others continued to live. I would have felt better if there had been a catastrophe and all of us had been in the same boat, heading for the same abyss toward which they were carrying me now. Help! I tried to cry out. I\u2019m still alive. I haven\u2019t died. My mind is still functioning! They placed my coffin at the edge of the grave. They are going to bury me! My wife is going to forget all about me; she will marry someone else and spend the money we have struggled to save for all these years! But who cares about that. I want to be with her now, because I\u2019m alive! I hear sobs, and I feel tears falling from my eyes, too. If my friends were to open my coffin now, they would see my tears and save me. But instead all I feel is the lowering of the coffin into the ground. Suddenly, everything is dark. A moment ago, there was a ray of light at the edge of the coffin, but now the darkness is complete. The grave diggers\u2019 shovels are filling in the grave, and I\u2019m alive! Buried alive! I sense that the air is being cut off, and the fragrance of the flowers is awful. I hear the mourners\u2019 departing footsteps. My terror is total. I\u2019m not able to do anything; if they go away now, it will soon be night, and no one will hear me knocking on the lid of my coffin! The footsteps fade, nobody hears my screams, and I am alone in the darkness; the air is heavy, and the smell of the flowers is driving me crazy. Suddenly, I hear a sound. It\u2019s the worms, coming to eat me alive. I try with all my strength to move the parts of my body, but I am inert. The worms begin to climb over my body. They are sticky and cold. They creep over my face and crawl into my shorts. One of them enters through my anus, and another begins to sneak into a nostril. Help! I\u2019m being eaten alive, and nobody can hear me; nobody says a word to me. The worm that entered my nostril has reached my throat. I feel another invading my ear. I have to get out! Where is God; why doesn\u2019t he help me? They are beginning to eat at my throat, and soon I won\u2019t be able to scream! They": "Paulo",

I didn't cry. Instead, I became physically ill. Over and over, my stomach repelling the truth that I refused to believe. When there was nothing left in me, I fell backward onto the grass and stared up at the sky, the stars staring back at me. Millions of stars staring back at the whole world.

It was like he knew what I was going to do before I did it. He halted my attack with a glancing blow to the side of my head. I knew it would hurt later, but my adrenaline was running too strong for me to pay attention to it now.Distantly, I realized some other people had come to watch us. Dimitri and I were celebrities in different ways around here, and our mentoring relationship added to the drama. This was prime-time entertainment.My eyes were only on Dimitri, though. As we tested each other, attacking and blocking, I tried to remember everything he'd taught me. I also tried to remember everything I knew about him. I'd practiced with him for months. I knew him, knew his moves, just as he knew mine. I could anticipate him the same way. Once I started using that knowledge, the fight grew tricky. We were too well matched, both of us too fast. My heart thumped in my chest, and sweat coated my skin.Then Dimitri finally got through. He moved in for an attack, coming at me with the full force of his body. I blocked the worst of it, but he was so strong that I was the one who stumbled from the impact. He didn't waste the opportunity and dragged me to the ground, trying to pin me. Being trapped like that by a Strigoi would likely result in the neck being bitten or broken. I couldn't let that happen.So, although he held most of me to the ground, I managed to shove my elbow up and nail him in the face. He flinched and that was all I needed. I rolled him over and held him down. He fought to push me off, and I pushed right back while also trying to maneuver my stake. He was so strong, though. I was certain I wouldn't be able to hold him. Then, just as I thought I'd lose my hold, I got a good grip on the stake. And like that, the stake came down over his heart. It was done.Behind me, people were clapping but all I noticed was Dimitri. Our gazes were locked. I was still straddling him, my hands pressed against his chest. Both of us were sweaty and breathing heavily. His eyes looked at me with pride\u2014and hell of a lot more. He was so close and my body yearned for him, again thinking he was a piece of me I needed in order to be complete.

  "Syn finished with dispatch then called his first officer. While waiting for the phone to be answered he told Furi to pack a bag with whatever he would need for the next couple of days. Furi didn\u2019t move.\u201cFurious,\u201d Syn growled. He wanted to get the hell out of that apartment just in case Sasha wanted to come finish the job.\u201cI\u2019m not leaving. She is not going to run me out of my own damn place.\u201d Furi jutted out his chin in defiance.Syn forgot about his phone call and came to stand directly in front of Furi. \u201cGo and pack a bag now. That crazy bitch is not going to get a second chance if I have anything to say about it.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t have anything to say about it.\u201d\u201cThe hell I don\u2019t,\u201d Syn barked. \u201cYour foolish pride will get you killed. Let's deal with her and then you\u2019re more than welcome to come home. Don\u2019t let your stubbornness make you an easy target, because that\u2019s just stupid.\u201d\u201cYou calling me stupid?\u201d Furi snapped right back.Syn rolled his eyes in frustration. \u201cAre you fuckin\u2019 kiddin\u2019 me? Furious we don\u2019t have time for this Mickey Mouse bullshit right now. Go get your shit and let\u2019s move.\u201d Syn went over to the only window in Furi\u2019s apartment and stood watch while Furi threw some clothes, toiletries, books and a laptop into a bag, grumbling curses the entire time. Syn let him say whatever he wanted to, as long as he was doing what needed to be done.Furi had a large duffle draped over his shoulder when he came to stand in front of Syn. \u201cDone, Detective. Anything else you want to order me to do?\u201dSyn took a quick calming breath. He took Furi\u2019s duffle off his shoulder and set it gently at his feet. He put his arms around Furi\u2019s waist and pulled him to him. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to order you around. I just can\u2019t let anyone hurt you.\u201d Syn squeezed his eyes shut.": "A.E.",
  "Excuse me, sir.\u201d One the young officers put his hand up to stop them. \u201cAre you Furious Barkley?\u201d\u201cMaybe. Maybe not. Is there a problem, officers?\u201d Doug stepped in front of Furi.\u201cDamn straight there\u2019s a problem.\u201d Syn stepped inside the door, yanking his dark aviator glasses off his face. The scowl he wore told Furi this was not a pleasant coincidence. \u201cThanks guys, you can go.\u201dFuri stood with his mouth hanging open while Syn dismissed the officers.\u201cSeriously, Starsky. You gonna track my boy down every time he leaves the house?\u201d Doug said angrily, still blocking Furi.\u201cHe\u2019s not your boy. And what I do regarding Furi is none of your goddamn business.\u201d Syn\u2019s clenched jaw made his words sound like an evil hiss. He shouldered past Doug and got directly in Furi\u2019s face. \u201cWhen I\u2019ve been calling him for over six hours and he hasn\u2019t picked up or returned any of my calls, I\u2019ll send a fuckin\u2019 SWAT team to find him if I want to.\u201dSyn spun and pointed his finger in Doug\u2019s face, \u201cThat\u2019s my say, not yours.\u201d Syn\u2019s voice was rising with his growing temper, and all eyes were on them.\u201cOkay, let\u2019s get out of here.\u201d Furi pushed at both men, urging them out the door.As soon as they were out in the brisk fall air, Syn rounded on Furi, pushing their chest together. \u201cWhere have you been, Furious? I\u2019ve been going crazy trying to check on you, and you\u2019re sitting here casually eating pancakes,\u201d Syn growled.\u201cHey, back up, man.\u201d Doug tried to wedge in between Furi and Syn.Syn looked up in annoyance. \u201cDoug, I swear, if you touch me, I\u2019m gonna ensure that you never regain the use of that hand.\u201d\u201cOkay, okay.\u201d Furi put both hands flat on Syn\u2019s chest, feeling his rapid heartbeat underneath all that muscle. Fuck. He really was scared. What was I thinking turning off my phone with everything that\u2019s going on? \u201cSyn. I\u2019m so sorry. I turned my phone off because\u2013\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t owe him an explanation. You\u2019re a grown man, Furious. You were having a business meeting; he has no right to demand you be available to him at all times, just like Patrick.\u201dFuri and Syn both snapped at Doug. But Furi took control. \u201cHey! Don\u2019t you ever say that again. This man is nothing like that asshole.\u201d Furi shook his head at the absurdity of Doug\u2019s accusation. \u201cDon\u2019t even say his name in the same sentence as Patrick\u2019s.\u201dDoug looked at Furi as if he were a stranger.\u201cDoug, you don\u2019t know everything that\u2019s been going on. But I promise I\u2019ll catch you up, okay? Then you\u2019re going to feel pretty shitty about what you just said about Syn.\u201d Furi nodded his head. \u201cGo home. I\u2019ll call you when I\u2019m back at Syn\u2019s place.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re staying with him?\u201d Doug yelled.\u201cDoug. You know it\u2019s not safe at my place,\u201d Furi said softly, his eyes pleading with his friend for him to understand.\u201cThen you should come to stay with me. I don\u2019t trust this guy!\u201d\u201cThis is fuckin\u2019 crazy,\u201d Syn snarled. \u201cI know you\u2019re his friend, but you\u2019re sounding more pissed than a friend should be.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t try to read me, Detective. Furi is my best friend, and I\u2019ve had his back since the first day he got here.\u201d Doug wasn\u2019t backing down from Syn\u2019s intimidating posture. Syn\u2019s dark glasses were back on, creating a perfectly badass look with his black leather coat and boots. All the hardware Syn had tucked under his arms and the shiny badge hanging around his neck was a sight right out of a sexy cop porno.": "A.E.",

  "This was it. This would be my final mission. An overwhelming sadness swept over me at the realization. There would be no more racing across campus to replace the missing arm of the Caesar Augustus statue with one made of pink duct tape. My mind would no longer be used as a photographic tool to unveil a terrorist\u2019s plan. No more last-minute science experiments to help rescue a father and daughter from a terrorist organization. I wouldn\u2019t get to rescue myself with the aid of a Millard-enhanced device. No more disguises involving wigs and glasses to save a Van Gogh painting. The Mariinsky Theatre, the Superman building, the Louvre\u2014my stories would disappear, along with my memories. Light had vanished around me as the ocean swallowed me. I\u2019d been unable to save a helpless girl from her evil kidnapper. In the darkness I heard Daly\u2019s voice, clear and strong, almost like he was there. Don\u2019t give up. Fight. Push yourself.

  "Day pushed God out of his space and turned to walk away without another word.\u201cOh no you don\u2019t,\u201d God snarled before grabbing Day around his waist and pulling him back into the darkness of the alley. He pushed Day up against the brick wall and pressed his forehead hard against his. \u201cYou think I\u2019m just going to let you walk off?\u201d\u201cYep. Just like you did this morning,\u201d Day replied without a second thought.He\u2019d be damned if that response didn\u2019t hurt like hell. He kept their foreheads touching but lost some of his anger. \u201cI apologized for that.\u201d\u201cYou sent me a goddamn text message, coward. Now get off me. I\u2019m going home\u2026alone now, thanks to you,\u201d Day hissed.\u201cYou were really going to fuck that guy?\u201d God asked incredulously.\u201cYou\u2019re goddamn right I was,\u201d Day retorted.\u201cEven though you\u2019re in love with me?\u201dWhy did God say that? He watched his partner\u2019s face go from mad to stark-raving livid. Before he could process what was happing, Day had caught him with a right punch twice to his rib cage making him cry out in pain at his already tender ribs.\u201cFuck!\u201d God yelled as he was shoved backward hard enough to almost knock him off balance since he was already doubled over.\u201cCan\u2019t believe you just said that, asshole,\u201d Day said while moving in on him again. \u201cThink I\u2019m going to let you string me along?\u201dGod held his ribs and put one hand up to stop Day\u2019s approach but it was useless. Day dropped like a martial arts master and did a backward spin kick, effectively knocking both God\u2019s legs from under him and sending him crashing to the ground\u2014and two-hundred and fifty pounds hitting the asphalt really hurt.\u201cThe bigger they are, the harder they fucking fall,\u201d Day snarled, and began to move in again.What the fuck?God knew Day was quick, he\u2019d seen him in action too many times. God\u2019s only defense was his muscle, but he had to get his hands on Day first, which wouldn\u2019t be easy. God rolled and came up off the ground, quicker than Day expected, and he caught Day\u2019s left punch in mid-throw and spun him around. He yanked Day into his chest but took a hard elbow to his right cheek with Day\u2019s right arm before he was able to secure it with the other one.\u201cEnough,\u201d God growled in his ear. Day\u2019s back was pressed hard against God\u2019s chest, while God held both hand\u2019s tightly in front of him. \u201cStop fighting me.\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d Day snapped.\u201cStop fighting me, Leo. Because I love you too,\u201d God said, his lips pressed firmly against Day\u2019s ear. \u201cYou can\u2019t fuck that other guy because you\u2019re mine,\u201d he whispered.God felt Day\u2019s body go limp in his tight hold and he took the opportunity to spin him around to face him. He looked into soft hazel eyes and lost himself. \u201cI do, sweetheart. I think I may always have. I just didn\u2019t know it until after you walked out of my apartment this morning.\u201d God took a deep breath and shook his head, his eyes squeezed shut at the vision that popped up. \u201cAfter I hurt you.\u201dDay didn\u2019t pull away, but God could see the hurt was still there. Man, how he wished he could take it all back. He swore he would have done it all differently. \u201cLeo. Please forgive me. I\u2019m so sorry, and I promise I\u2019ll never put my hands on you in anger again.\u201d God watched Day for any signs of forgiveness. Day\u2019s head was down, he was still as a rock, and he still hadn\u2019t spoken.God released Day\u2019s arms, took one hand and slowly lifted Day\u2019s chin so he could look into those beautiful eyes again. Day\u2019s eyes were moist but focused.\u201cSay something, sweetheart. Tell me you forgive me. Tell me you love me, or tell me to go to hell, just say something,\u201d God begged, the silence driving him mad.God was beginning to think he\u2019d really lost his best friend until Day finally spoke. \u201cI usually don\u2019t like endearments but I think I like you calling me sweetheart.": "A.E.",
  "Day had fucked up big time. This was all his fault, all because he couldn\u2019t keep his nosy ass out of other peoples private business. Day rushed to God\u2019s side.\u201cI\u2019ll help you ba\u2014\u201d Day didn\u2019t know how, but God had found enough strength after that beating to push him so hard that he flew into the dresser, knocking it and all of the items that were on top of it to the floor, including the television. Day rolled a few feet, the dresser just missing falling on top of him.\u201cCash, what the fuck!\u201d Day cursed.He rolled to his side and winced at the sharp pain in his ribs from coming into contact with the dresser.\u201cI was trying to help you get into bed.\u201d\u201cGet the fuck out, Leo.\u201d God\u2019s face was an unyielding mask. For the first time in four long years, Day couldn\u2019t read what the hell was going through God\u2019s mind.Day stood slowly. \u201cGod, I only called him because I needed to go\u2014\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter why you did it! You had no right! You have no clue what you just did!\u201d God yelled. \u201cNow get out!\u201d\u201cCashel, please. Just hear me out,\u201d Day pleaded. His eyes begged for God to see the sincerity in them. He really didn\u2019t mean for any of this to happen. \u201cBaby, I swear. I didn\u2019t know any of this was happening between you and your family. You should\u2019ve told me. Why was he calling you a murderer?\u201dNo matter what, Day couldn\u2019t turn off his detective side.Day watched God squeeze his eyes shut. He went down on one knee and clutched his chest when the hard coughing started again. God\u2019s eyes were full of water and pain. Day timidly eased over to God\u2019s side but God cut his eyes at him, daring him to come any closer.Day had to fight the moisture in his own eyes. \u201cI just want to help you into bed.\u201d\u201cDay, if you don\u2019t get the fuck out of my house, I\u2019m going to show you why he called me a murderer,\u201d God said through clenched teeth.Day couldn\u2019t stop the gasp that escaped his lips, or the pain that radiated through his chest, as if his rib cage had been torn open and his heart ripped out and thrown underneath the bed. Day kept his eyes on God as he knelt to pick up the dresser, then the television. God watched him as well. Day didn\u2019t say anything as the rogue tear fell down his face without his permission. Day went around to the opposite side of the bed and pulled a pen and piece of scrap paper from the drawer, still watching God carefully. He really didn\u2019t like the look on his best friend\u2019s face. He\u2019d seen the look before, but he\u2019d never had it leveled on him. Day scribbled a couple of phone numbers on the paper.": "A.E.",
  "Looks like things are good,\u201d Day said casually. \u201cI\u2019m happy for you.\u201d\u201cThings were better than good, baby. My mom was so happy to see me. She made me raisin bread, and she even popped me in the head a few times when I told her I\u2019d pissed you off. She wants to meet you real soon, sweetheart,\u201d God said breathlessly around all his excitement.\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to it,\u201d Day said climbing in bed.\u201cOh come on, Leo, you can\u2019t still be mad at me.\u201d God huffed. When Day still didn\u2019t speak, God threw his hands up in the air. \u201cOkay, fine. I shouldn\u2019t have said what I said. I\u2019m sorry all right. There. Does that make you happy now, or do I have to go out and by you some fuckin\u2019 flowers and candy and shit? Stop acting like this. I had a good day, babe, and I want to fuck you.\u201d God dropped his voice low.\u201cI have a headache and don\u2019t feel like having sex\u2026since you\u2019re dating a bitch. Good night, Cashel.\u201d Day flicked the switch on the small lamp by his side of the bed putting them in total darkness. Day pulled the covers up on him and turned his back to God and willed himself to go to sleep.Day woke up before five a.m. and was pissed when he couldn\u2019t go back to sleep. Although his back was to him, he could tell God was awake too by the way he was breathing. Day finally got sick of lying there and got out of bed. He slid his feet in his leather slippers and went downstairs. Day got the paper off the front step and went to the kitchen for coffee. He was in the den watching Food Network, sipping his second cup when he had an urge to go back upstairs and climb back in bed with God.This was bullshit. This was a stupid fight they were having and he wanted it over. Day was sure there would be real shit for them to fight about in the future, they didn\u2019t need to waste time on crap like this. But still\u2026Day didn\u2019t move.": "A.E.",

  "You don\u2019t want none of this, man. Stay out of it.\u201d Preppy looked around Syn, obviously wanting some more of Furious.\u201cMaybe I do.\u201d Syn looked bored and then thought for a second. If he broke this kid\u2019s jaw, that could be his damn promotion. Just when the kid looked like he wanted to start something, Syn pulled his badge. \u201cMaybe a night in lock-up will get you to shut the fuck up.\u201dSyn heard the guy he punched groaning and looked at him, not wanting to find himself attacked from behind too. What he was surprised to not find was Furious. Syn pulled out his cell and called 911, he gave his name and badge number and told dispatch he had a few drunk and disorderlies that needed clearing out.Syn desperately wanted to find Furious. He knew the man was alright. Surely he was able to take a gut punch, but he wanted to talk to him. Syn knew he may have already fucked up. Without thinking, he\u2019d pushed Furi behind him like he couldn\u2019t defend himself. But when Syn saw the pain of that punch flash over the man\u2019s beautiful face, his protective instincts rose with a vengeance and he\u2019d acted. He looked back and forth from the bar, to the door, to the college assholes, wanting to run and find Furi, but he couldn\u2019t leave his perps unattended until the uniforms got there.": "A.E.",

What do you think Albert will do now?\u201d He bit savagely at his thumb, a nervous habit.\u201cI thought you were the king!\u201dCaine reacted without thinking. He swung a hard backhand at her face. The blow did not connect, but the thought did. Penny flew backward like she\u2019d been hit by a bus.

I\u2019m not scared of you, freak.\u201d\u201cYou should be,\u201d Brianna hissed.Suddenly there was Dekka, up off her chair, hand extended between Brianna and Zil. \u201cNo,\u201d she said in her deep voice. \u201cNone of that.\u201dQuinn joined her. \u201cDekka\u2019s right, we can\u2019t be having fights and stuff here. Sam will shut this place down.\u201d\u201cMaybe we should have two different clubs,\u201d a seventh grader named Antoine said. \u201cYou know, one for freaks and one for normals.\u201d\u201cMan, what is the matter with you?\u201d Quinn demanded.\u201cI don\u2019t like her acting like she\u2019s so cool, is all,\u201d Zil said, stepping beside Antoine.\u201cYou should be on our side, Quinn. Everyone knows you\u2019re a normal,\u201d another kid, Lance, said. \u201cWell\u2026kind of normal. You\u2019re still Quinn.": "Michael",
  "He\u2019s a murdering chud,\u201d Zil was yelling.\u201cWhat do you want to do? Lynch him?\u201d Astrid demanded.That stopped the flow for a second as kids tried to figure out what \u201clynch\u201d meant. But Zil quickly recovered.\u201cI saw him do it. He used his powers to kill Harry.\u201d\u201cI was trying to stop you from smashing my head in!\u201d Hunter shouted.\u201cYou\u2019re a lying mutant freak!\u201d\u201cThey think they can do anything they want,\u201d another voice shouted.Astrid said, as calmly as she could while still pitching her voice to be heard, \u201cWe are not going down that path, people, dividing up between freaks and normals.\u201d\u201cThey already did it!\u201d Zil cried. \u201cIt\u2019s the freaks acting all special and like their farts don\u2019t stink.\u201dThat earned a laugh.\u201cAnd now they\u2019re starting to kill us,\u201d Zil cried.Angry cheers.Edilio squared his shoulders and stepped into the crowd. He went first to Hank, the kid with the shotgun. He tapped him on the shoulder and said, \u201cGive me that thing.\u201d\u201cNo way,\u201d Hank said. But he didn\u2019t seem too certain.\u201cYou want to have that thing fire by accident and blow someone\u2019s face off?\u201d Edilio held his hand out. \u201cGive it to me, man.\u201dZil rounded on Edilio. \u201cYou going to make Hunter give up his weapon? Huh? He\u2019s got powers, man, and that\u2019s okay, but the normals can\u2019t have any weapon? How are we supposed to defend ourselves from the freaks?\u201d\u201cMan, give it a rest, huh?\u201d Edilio said. He was doing his best to sound more weary than angry or scared. Things were already bad enough. \u201cZil, you want to be responsible if that gauge goes off and kills Astrid? You want to maybe give that some thought?\u201dZil blinked. But he said, \u201cDude, I\u2019m not scared of Sam.\u201d\u201cSam won\u2019t be your problem, I will be,\u201d Edilio snapped, losing patience. \u201cAnything happens to her, I\u2019ll take you down before Sam ever gets the chance.\u201dZil snorted derisively. \u201cAh, good little boy, Edilio, kissing up to the chuds. I got news for you, dilly dilly, you\u2019re a lowly normal, just like me and the rest of us.\"\u201cI\u2019m going to let that go,\u201d Edilio said evenly, striving to regain his cool, trying to sound calm and in control, even though he could hardly take his eyes off the twin barrels of the shotgun. \u201cBut now I\u2019m taking that shotgun.\u201d\u201cNo way!\u201d Hank cried, and the next thing was an explosion so loud, Edilio thought a bomb had gone off. The muzzle flash blinded him, like camera flash going off in his face.Someone yelled in pain.Edilio staggered back, squeezed his eyes shut, trying to adjust. When he opened them again the shotgun was on the ground and the boy who\u2019d accidentally fired it was holding his bruised hand, obviously shocked.Zil bent to grab the gun. Edilio took two steps forward and kicked Zil in the face. As Zil fell back Edilio made a grab for the shotgun. He never saw the blow that turned his knees to water and filled his head with stars.He fell like a sack of bricks, but even as he fell he lurched forward to cover the shotgun.Astrid screamed and launched herself down the stairs to protect Edilio.Antoine, the one who had hit Edilio, was raising his bat to hit Edilio again, but on the back swing he caught Astrid in the face.Antoine cursed, suddenly fearful. Zil yelled, \u201cNo, no, no!\u201dThere was a sudden rush of running feet. Down the walkway, into the street, echoing down the block.": "Michael",
  "I\u2019m getting my stuff,\u201d he said, and bolted for the steps.\u201cYou don\u2019t have to move out,\u201d Astrid called after him.Sam stopped halfway up the steps. \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry. Is that the voice of the council telling me where I can go?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s no point having a town council if you think you don\u2019t have to listen to it,\u201d Astrid said. She was using her patient voice, trying to calm the situation. \u201cSam, if you ignore us, no one will pay attention.\u201d\u201cGuess what, Astrid, they\u2019re already ignoring you. The only reason anyone pays any attention to you and the others is because they\u2019re scared of Edilio\u2019s soldiers.\u201d He thumped his chest. \u201cAnd even more scared of me.": "Michael",
  "Whore!\u201d he snarls, slamming me into the wall so hard stars burst in my eyes. I hiss at him, the tiger in me threatening to emerge and rip out his throat, but a shout brings me back to myself.\u201cZahra!\u201dI turn my head and see Aladdin running toward us. When he sees that it\u2019s Darian holding me roughly against the wall, his face twists into such rage that he seems unrecognizable.He crashes into Darian before the prince has a chance to say anything. The two slam into the ground, Aladdin throwing a punch that cracks against Darian\u2019s jaw.\u201cStop it!\u201d I cry. \u201cPrince Rahzad!\u201dThe boys ignore me, rolling and thrashing like": "Jessica",

Flipping my torso over I get one quick glance of their backs. They\u2019re wearing parkas and hats and look normal, like people, but faster. I smash onto my face again and lift up my head just in time to see Nick snarling inside the net. He\u2019s transformed again.\u201cNick!\u201d I yell, but snow pours into my mouth. Sharp cold pain smashes through my teeth and into my skull. I cough and try again. \u201cNick!\u201dHe raises himself up onto four legs and howls, a long, searing cry of anguish and rage.My heart breaks for him, caught there. I have to help him escape.

But truth be told, Oliver never was much of a traveler. Even locally there were certainly higher quality casinos to choose from, taller parking garages from which to leap. Instead he found himself perched atop the nearest appropriately-sized structure to his home, that being the parking garage of the Circus Time Hotel & Casino. His view not of Alcatraz Island and the rough waters of the San Francisco Bay, nor the breathtaking vistas of the Arizona desert, or the romanticism of the Paris skyline for that matter. Rather he found himself bathed in a noxious blend of pink and green neon, staring into a pair of giant blinking pastel eyes belonging to the eighty-foot clown staring down at him like a frilly guardian angel. Then again, when your primary objective is to pancake yourself on a public sidewalk, perhaps you\u2019re not in the best position to nitpick over the intricacies of what does and does not constitute bad taste.

But I am sure I have always thought of Christmas time, when it has come round -- apart from the veneration due to its sacred name and origin, if anything belonging to it can be apart from that -- as a good time: a kind, forgiving, charitable, pleasant time: the only time I know of, in the long calendar of the year, when men and women seem by one consent to open their shut-up hearts freely, and to think of people below them as if they really were fellow-passengers to the grave, and not another race of creatures bound on other journeys.

His kindness fell but hardly on the homeless--fell but hardly on the homes where the hearth was not very warm, and where the food had little fragrance, where the human faces had no sunshine in them,but rather the leaden, blank-eyed gaze of unexpectant want.

  "Twas the night before Christmas, when all through the houseNot a creature was stirring, not even a mouse;The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,In hopes that St. Nicholas soon would be there;The children were nestled all snug in their beds;While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;And mamma in her 'kerchief, and I in my cap,Had just settled our brains for a long winter's nap,When out on the lawn there arose such a clatter,I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.Away to the window I flew like a flash,Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash.The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow,Gave a lustre of midday to objects below,When what to my wondering eyes did appear,But a miniature sleigh and eight tiny rein-deer,With a little old driver so lively and quick,I knew in a moment he must be St. Nick.More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,And he whistled, and shouted, and called them by name:\"Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now Prancer and Vixen!On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blixen!To the top of the porch! to the top of the wall!Now dash away! dash away! dash away all!\"As leaves that before the wild hurricane fly,When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky;So up to the housetop the coursers they flewWith the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas too\u2014And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roofThe prancing and pawing of each little hoof.As I drew in my head, and was turning around,Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.He was dressed all in fur, from his head to his foot,And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,And he looked like a pedler just opening his pack.His eyes\u2014how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry!His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,And the smoke, it encircled his head like a wreath;He had a broad face and a little round bellyThat shook when he laughed, like a bowl full of jelly.He was chubby and plump, a right jolly old elf,And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself;A wink of his eye and a twist of his headSoon gave me to know I had nothing to dread;He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,And laying his finger aside of his nose,And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose;He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight\u2014\u201cHappy Christmas to all, and to all a good night!": "Clement",

I'd even extend the goodwill not just to living creatures but to the dearly departed, and if we include them, we might as well include the undead, those supposedly mythic beings like vampires, and if they're in, then so are elves, fairies, and gnomes. Heck, since we're already being so generous in our big group hug, why not also embrace those supposedly inanimate objects like dolls and stuffed animals. I'm sure Santa would agree.

  "I am a bomb but I mean you no harm. That I still am here to tell this, is a miracle: I was deployed on May 15, 1957, but I didn\u2019t go off because a British nuclear engineer, a young father, developed qualms after seeing pictures of native children marveling at the mushrooms in the sky, and sabotaged me. I could see why during that short drop before I hit the atoll: the island looks like god\u2019s knuckles in a bathtub, the ocean is beautifully translucent, corals glow underwater, a dead city of bones, allowing a glimpse into a white netherworld. I met the water and fell a few feet into a chromatic cemetery. The longer I lie here, listening to my still functioning electronic innards, the more afraid I grow of detonating after all this time.

Kneel down before me.--And a third, Stephen said, there is who wants me for odd jobs.--Italian? Haines said again. What do you mean?--The imperial British state, Stephen answered, his colour rising, and the holy Roman catholic and apostolic church.--I can quite understand that, he said calmly. An Irishman must think like that, I daresay. We feel in England that we have treated you rather unfairly.

I do not want to be false. I want to be a person. And I want to feel and I want to think, and no, not everything in life is something to be grateful for; and no, not everything in the world is something to be happy about. I am a person. My face can do a lot of things aside from smiling. My face can look peaceful, it can look thoughtful, it can look Divine. I can frown and sometimes my eyebrows are scrunched up in the middle; that's because I'm thinking! I am a person. A person that is so much more than what popular opinion expects is the definition of perfection. But I AM perfect. I am perfect the very way that I am.

  "This gesture is one of the motifs of modernity's turn against the principle of imitating nature, that is to say, imitating predefined morphological expectations. It is still capable of perceiving message-totalities and autonomous thing-signals when no morphologically intact figures are left - indeed, precisely then. The sense for perfection withdraws from the forms of nature - probably because nature itself is in the process of losing its ontological authority. The popularization of photography also increasingly devalues the standard views of things. As the first edition of the visible, nature comes into discredit. It can no longer assert its authority as the sender of binding messages - for reasons that ultimately come from its disenchantment through being scientifically explored and technically outdone. After this shift, 'being perfect' takes on an altered meaning: it means having something to say that is more meaningful than the chatter of conventional totalities.

Love itself is what is left over when being in love has burned away, and this is both an art and a fortunate accident.

  "Oh the madness of battle! We fear it, we celebrate it, the poets sing of it, and when it fills the blood like fire it is a real madness. It is joy! All the terror is swept away, a man feels he could live for ever, he sees the enemy retreating, knows he himself is invincible, that even the gods would shrink from his blade and his bloodied shield. And I was still keening that mad song, the battle song of slaughter, the sound that blotted out the screams of dying men and the crying of the wounded. It is fear, of course, that feeds the battle madness, the release of fear into savagery.

Looks within, pulls a bit out, puts bits in, sews you up. Then! If you\u2019re lucky, you awake! Some don\u2019t wake, this is my point, will you wake? Why should you? How can you? That\u2019s the black hole of madness you\u2019re in! Screaming to get out: \u2018Alive\u2019 or just \u2018Sane\u2019! You want out of it, you want to see the light!": "Stephen",

And if you\u2019re 13 years old and sitting in front of one do what I never\u2026chin him \u2018cos if you don\u2019t you\u2019ll live to regret it.

  "Insanity can be a heavy cross to bear; I mean look at all those people in loony bins compared to those that are free and walking the streets \u2013 a tiny percentage are classed as mad.

Whoever makes these decisions has to be a loon and a half!": "Stephen",
  "There are different categories of madmen, and different types of asylums! I know absolutely nothing about the asylums that house the madman who thinks he is a space man. Would you believe that 90% of madmen are treated in outside clinics?": "Stephen",

It was like a film in fast motion, the moon waxing and waning, clouds rushing across the sky. Vines grew from the ground so fast they twined up the trees like snakes; seasons passing in the wink of an eye, entire years for all I know. . . . Mean we think of phenomenal change as being the very essence of time, when it's not at all. Time is something which defies spring and water, birth and decay, the good and the bad, indifferently. Something changeless and joyous and absolutely indestructible. Duality ceases to exist; there is no ego, no 'I,' and yet it's not at all like those horrid comparisons one sometimes hears in Eastern religions, the self being a drop of water swallowed by the ocean of the universe.

I'm surprised England doesn't pay attention to this. It's made by a lame cooper, and one can see that the fool understands nothing about the moon. He used tarred rope and a quantity of cheap olive oil, and that's why there's a terrible stench all over the earth, so that you have to hold your nose.

  "I don't think I could ever see her closely,\" the sentinel replied, \"however close she came.\" His own voice was hushed and regretful, echoing with lost chances. \"She has a newness,\" he said. \"Everything is for the first time. See how she moves, how she walks, how she turns her head -- all for the first time, the first time anyone has ever done these things. See how she draws her breath and lets it go again, as though no one else in the world knew that air was good. It is all for her. If I learned that she had been born this very morning, I would only be surprised that she was so old.\" The second sentinel stared down from his tower at the three wanderers. The tall man saw him first, and next the dour woman. Their eyes reflected nothing but his armor, grim and cankered and empty. But then the girl in the ruined black cloak raised her head, and he stepped back from the parapet, putting out one tin glove against her glance. In a moment she passed into the shadow of the castle with her companions, and he lowered his hand. \"She may be mad,\" he said calmly. \"No grown girl looks like that unless she is mad. That would be annoying, but far preferable to the remaining possibility.\" \"Which is?\" the younger man prompted after a silence.\"Which is that she was indeed born this morning. I would rather that she were mad.": "Peter",

  "He shook hands. With greening faces, with eyes full of sparks, his two friends leaned upon their canes. One had on a crushed bowler (why?)... Both were weary. Both knew that what was approaching was the end. Both had spent the day in their offices and when they interrupted their work with an indiscreet nod, when they turned the conversation toward that end, both broke in \"Lord, we have strayed from our business.\" And ever deeper sunk their eyes, a deathly shadow was descending. The words of his friends had been bought with blood, but they were stolen. Someone, listening, recorded them on a phonograph and thousands of cylinders began to twang. A new enterprise opened, on sale a bronze throat, a screaming cavity; an experienced mechanic installed the throat phonograph. The purchased throat squealed day and night and his friends grew exhausted and one day he said to them both \"Lord, I am going.\" He grinned. And they grinned: they understood everything. Now they stood on the platform, stood with him and saw him off. Someone long and dark with the face of an ox, shoulders crooked as a sorrowful cemetery cross and wrapped up in a frock-coat, swept into the coach. And then the bell rang, and then they waved their bowlers; three wooden arms swung in the air.(\"Adam\")": "Andrei",

  "The bast, dispersing in shreds in the sunset whispered \"Time has begun.\" The son, Adam, stripped naked, descended into the Old Testament of his native land and arrayed himself in bast; a wreath of roadside field grass he placed upon his brow, a staff, not a switch, he pulled from the ground, flourishing the birch branch like a sacred palm. On the road he stood like a guard. The dust-gray road ran into the sunset. And a crow perched there, perched and croaked, there where the celestial fire consumed the earth.There were blind men along the dust-gray road running into the twilight. Antique, crooken, they trailed along, lonely and sinister silhouettes, holding to one another and to their leader's cane. They were raising dust. One was beard-less, he kept squinting. Another, a little old man with a protruding lip, was whispering and praying. A third, covered with red hair, frowned. Their backs were bent, their heads bowed low, their arms extended to the staff. Strange it was to see this mute procession in the terrible twilight. They made their way immutable, primordial, blind. Oh, if only they could open their eyes, oh if only they were not blind! Russian Land, awake!And Adam, rude image of the returned king, lowered the birch branch to their white pupils. And on them he laid his hands, as, groaning and moaning they seated themselves in the dust and with trembling hands pushed chunks of black bread into their mouths. Their faces were ashen and menacing, lit with the pale light of deadly clouds. Lightning blazed, their blinded faces blazed. Oh, if only they opened their eyes, oh, if only they saw the light!Adam, Adam, you stand illumined by lightnings. Now you lay the gentle branch upon their faces. Adam, Adam, say, see, see! And he restores their sight.But the blind men turning their ashen faces and opening their white eyes did not see. And the wind whispered \"Thou art behind the hill.\" From the clouds a fiery veil began to shimmer and died out. A little birch murmured, beseeching, and fell asleep. The dusk dispersed at the horizon and a bloody stump of the sunset stuck up. And spotted with brilliant coals glowing red, the bast streamed out from the sunset like a striped cloak. On the waxen image of Adam the field grass wreaths sighed fearfully giving a soft whistle and the green dewy clusters sprinkled forth fiery tears on the blind faces of the blind. He knew what he was doing, he was restoring their sight.(\"Adam\")": "Andrei",
  "There was a single window that tapered into a funnel, with eerie moonlight passing through it, reflecting directly off the globe like a mirror. For a moment, as I rose I saw something glimmering within. Dumbly, with feverish whispers assailing me, I realized it was the center of one of the distant galaxies, flaring after some unknown cataclysm. Its radiance was such that it burst from its prison. It met the moonlight halfway. It created kaleidoscopic colours on the walls. Then, in answer, the reliefs transformed from majestic art into something approaching divine, alive, plays from Egyptian memory, given the spark of life from space. I saw animal-headed gods move. They stepped from the walls to take their place around the altar. All stared at the globe. Each raised their arms in silent supplication.

  "The winter drove them mad. It drove every man mad who had ever lived through it; there was only ever the question of degree. The sun disappeared, and you could not leave the tunnels, and everything and everyone you loved was ten thousand miles away. At best, a man suffered from strange lapses in judgment and perception, finding himself at the mirror about to comb his hair with a mechanical pencil, stepping into his undershirt, boiling up a pot of concentrated orange juice for tea. Most men felt a sudden blaze of recovery in their hearts at the first glimpse of a pale hem of sunlight on the horizon in mid-September. But there were stories, apocryphal, perhaps, but far from dubious, of men in past expeditions who sank so deeply into the drift of their own melancholy that they were lost forever. And few among the wives and families of the men who returned from a winter on the Ice would have said what they got back was identical to what they had sent down there.": "Michael",

He began to tremble all over and dropped my hand from under his arm. Vera seized me cruelly by the arm and led me off... She led me through murky, dusty expanses, between strange machinery and constructions, through valleys and mountains and past a precarious wood to her dressing-room. And she still held me cruelly by the arm. There she slammed the door shut, rudely chasing away some handsome women with the amorous eyes of worshipers.I do not recall her words.

He was acquainted with such people and recognised them at once - although they were noticeable, perhaps, only for a slight twitch in the eye or the awkward gait with which they moved through the world. And they inhabited small rooms to which Hawksmoor would sometimes be called: rooms with a bed and a chair but nothing besides, rooms where they shut the door and began talking out loud, rooms where they sat all evening and waited for the night, rooms where they experienced blind panic and then rage as they stared at their lives.

He saw how the policeman took the telephone call at the station; how his name and address were spoken out loud; how he looked down at the floor as they led him away; how he was in the dock, forced to answer questions about himself, and now he was in a cell and had lost control of his own body. He was staring out of the window at the passing clouds when it occurred to him that he should write to his employer, explaining his drunkenness and confessing that he invented the story of theft; but who would believe him?

He had wanted her to acknowledge what she was, how she was wrong, how she shouldn't long for her father's love. It was soacked in blood. Didn't she see that? How could she not?Once, he'd hated her for it. Then it had somehow touched him. He knew it himself. He, too, wanted what he shouldn't. He, too, felt the heart chooses its own home and refuses reason. Not here, he'd tried to say. Not this. Not mine. Never. But he had felt the same sickness.In retrospect, Kestrel's role in the taking of the eastern plains was predictable. Sometimes he damned her for currying favor with the emperor, or blamed her playing war like a game just because she could. Yet he thought he knew the truth of her reasons.

Anyone stronger in terms of physical appearance, money, power, fame or name tramples upon the weak ones - that is the rule of the world. There are only two possible reasons behind it, love or hate. When you love someone you want to control everything that person does and hence, sometimes, knowingly or unknowingly you squash them like melons. While on the other hand in the case of hate, there is no need to specify the reason for walking over someone like that. Hate is a strong reason in itself. I am confused as to what crushed me, was it love or hate? I somehow don\u2019t like the sound of it \u2013 love, it in itself smells of treachery, for love is not a pure emotion. Lust and hatred are the only pure emotions. Love is camouflaged, for needs and desires. Desires \u2013 they are magical in their own way. They can be innocent. They can be monstrous. But they exist, no matter what, and many such needs and desires make us helpless slaves of the same. We hide these desires either in the realms of our mind or in the dusty corners of our hearts for we are scared\u2026what if someone finds out what we desire.

The eyes were the main feature. They were unusual eyes, not only almost unnaturally small, but vague, moist, dreamy, the eyes of a medium.

How many times have I told you that your basic error consists in underestimating the significance of the human eye. Understand that the tongue can conceal the truth, but the eyes - never! A sudden question is put to you, you don't even flinch, in one second you get hold of yourself and know what you must say to conceal the truth, and you speak quite convincingly, and not a wrinkle on your face moves, but - alas - the truth which the question stirs up from the bottom of your soul leaps momentarily into your eyes, and it's all over!

  "A black boy brought Wilson's gin and he sipped it very slowly because he had nothing else to do except to return to his hot and squalid room and read a novel - or a poem. Wilson liked poetry, but he absorbed it secretly, like a drug. The Golden Treasury accompanied him wherever he went, but it was taken at night in small doses - a finger of Longfellow, Macaulay, Mangan: 'Go on to tell how, with genius wasted, Betrayed in friendship, befooled in love...' His taste was romantic. For public exhibition he has his Wallace. He wanted passionately to be indistinguishable on the surface from other men: he wore his moustache like a club tie - it was his highest common factor, but his eyes betrayed him - brown dog's eyes, a setter's eyes, pointing mournfully towards Bond Street.": "Graham",

  "In my biology class, we'd talked about the definition of life: to be classified as a living creature, a thing needs to eat, breathe, reproduce, and grow. Dogs do, rocks don't, trees do, plastic doesn't. Fire, by that definition, is vibrantly alive. It eats everything from wood to flesh, excreting the waste as ash, and it breathes air just like a human, taking in oxygen and emitting carbon. Fire grows, and as it spreads, it creates new fires that spread out and make new fires of their own. Fire drinks gasoline and excretes cinders, it fights for territory, it loves and hates. Sometimes when I watch people trudging through their daily routines, I think that fire is more alive than we are\u2013brighter, hotter, more sure of itself and where it wants to go. Fire doesn't settle; fire doesn't tolerate; fire doesn't 'ge": "Dan",

With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic helmet numbered 451 on his stolid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies. He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the house.

  "As Sam came to a panting stop, a jet of orange flame burst from a high window.Several dozen kids were standing, watching.

I suppose flame is beautiful, the way it leaps into the air like it\u2019s free to do what it wants. Other elements are also free and I guess the sea can be pretty awesome, wind too, and lightning, but fire has a mind and a determination. You don\u2019t see it as a blind raging thing, which I suppose it is, but something that attacks and thinks and changes tactics. It has a malevolence that uses surprise, dirty tricks, cunning.

'It has stars in the bottom, and she always drinks her milk from it at home. She calls it her cup of stars because she can see the stars while she drinks her milk.' The waitress nodded, unconvinced, and the mother told the little girl, 'You'll have your milk from your cup of stars tonight when we get home. But just for now, just to be a very good little girl, will you take a little milk from this glass?'Don't do it, Eleanor told the little girl; insist on your cup of stars; once they have trapped you into being like everyone else you will never see your cup of stars again; don't do it; and the little girl glanced at her, and smiled a little subtle, dimpling, wholly comprehending smile, and shook her head stubbornly at the glass.

  "Have you ever played chess, Kitty?\u201dI eyed her. What did a board game have to do with this? \u201cNot really.\u201d\u201cYou and I should play sometime.

The strong pieces are in the back row, while the weak pieces\u2014the pawns\u2014are all in the front, ready to take the brunt of the attack. Because of their limited movement and vulnerability, most people underestimate them and only use them to protect the more powerful pieces. But when I play, I protect my pawns.\u201d\u201cWhy?\u201d I said, not entirely sure where this conversation was going. \u201cIf they\u2019re weak, then what\u2019s the point?\u201d\u201cThey may be weak when the game begins, but their potential is remarkable. Most of the time, they\u2019ll be taken by the other side and held captive until the end of the game. But if you\u2019re careful\u2014if you keep your eyes open and pay attention to what your opponent is doing, if you protect your pawns and they reach the other side of the board, do you know what happens then?\u201dI shook my head, and she smiled.\u201cYour pawn becomes a queen.\u201d She touched my cheek, her fingers cold as ice. \u201cBecause they kept moving forward and triumphed against impossible odds, they become the most powerful piece in the game.

  "In addition to conformity as a way to relieve the anxiety springing from separateness, another factor of contemporary life must be considered: the role of the work routine and the pleasure routine. Man becomes a 'nine to fiver', he is part of the labour force, or the bureaucratic force of clerks and managers. He has little initiative, his tasks are prescribed by the organisation of the work; there is even little difference between those high up on the ladder and those on the bottom. They all perform tasks prescribed by the whole structure of the organisation, at a prescribed speed, and in a prescribed manner. Even the feelings are prescribed: cheerfulness, tolerance, reliability, ambition, and an ability to get along with everybody without friction. Fun is routinised in similar, although not quite as drastic ways. Books are selected by the book clubs, movies by the film and theatre owners and the advertising slogans paid for by them; the rest is also uniform: the Sunday ride in the car, the television session, the card game, the social parties. From birth to death, from Monday to Monday, from morning to evening - all activities are routinised, and prefabricated.
