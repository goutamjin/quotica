  "There's this party tomorrow night. The client with all the ex-husbands is throwing it, and I've got to go. I know it's last minute, and that Fridays are really busy for you. I'm also sure it's going to be boring. Anyway, if you can't go, I completely understand. But if you don't come with me, I'll be forced to meet rich, eligible bachelors who may or may not have all their original teeth and hair.\"I bit my nail as I waited for his answer, trying to prepare myself for the possibility he couldn't go.\"You're not really giving me much of a choice,\" Jake said. \"Not when I know you've got a weakness for bald men with dentures.": "Cindi",

  "She rolled her eyes to the ceiling, clearly telling him what she thought about his need to protect his pride.He leaned down, his face inches from hers, and tapped a finger against her lips, somehow managing to ignore their softness and the overwhelming desire to taste them. \u201cYou\u2019re going to owe me for this one, I think.": "J.M.",
  "Cinderella was the first fairy tale I remember - the one I was most obsessed with because of the gowns and magic and pretty shoes. Yes, her home life was less than ideal - and considering the talking mice and birds, she probably needed serious therapy.": "Cindi",

  "Every now and then, we change our minds. It's our prerogative. The big secret is\" - I leaned in conspiratorially - \"sometimes, even we don't know why. There are times after we pick a fight where we're as confused as you are. But there's no way we're admitting it.\" I shrugged a shoulder, \"That's why we have boobs.\"Jake's eyebrows shot up.\"See, after we've acted crazy, and the guy's wondering what he's doing with us, we use them to mesmerize him, so he forgets that we're crazy.\" I shot Jake my most seductive smile and leaned the assets in question against his arm. \"And by the way, if you look at my cleavage right now, even though I'm the one talking about it, I'll accuse you of not caring about what I saw and of just treating me like an object.\"Jake swallowed hard, keeping eye contact with me, though I could tell he was fighting his impulse to look down. A mischievous glint flickered through his eyes. \"And treating you like an object would be bad?": "Cindi",
  "Logan's been one of Marietta's most eligible bachelors for too long. Ever since divorcing that useless ditz of a wife, we've all been watching waiting for him to dip his toes into the dating pool again. Nothing. Then, you show up and what happens?

  "We're not quitting until I'm satisfied you know what you're doing,\" he said in a low voice.\"Until we're both satisfied,\" she corrected. Killing. Him.": "Roxanne",
  "She shivered under his touch, desire dampening her panties and making her clench her thighs together in an attempt to find some relief. His devilish hands relaxed their grip on her hips and slid around to cup her ass, pulling her close. Thick, hard evidence of his desire pressed against her belly. God, she wanted this man, and not just to silent the stressful thoughts always swirling in her head. She wanted him, not just the divine moment of oblivion that blocked out everything else.The realization scared her and brought some unwanted reality into the room. \"We shouldn't be doing this.\"\"Why?\" He made quick work of the buttons on her petal-pink cashmere sweater and parted her cardigan. Sean gave a soft growl as he stared at her silver satin pushup bra that presented her boobs like an all-you-can-lick buffet. \"Because I'm your employee?\"He licked his lips and slid his thumb across the satin covering her hard nipple.\"Yes,\" she said, sighing. An answer to his question or a response to even the lightest of touches? Both.\"Easy fix.\" He snapped the front closure of her bra and her tits tumbled out. \"I quit.\"Bending forward, he lifted one heavy globe and took the hard nub into his hot mouth. Fire sizzled through her veins and it felt so good she couldn't wait to burn.\"You can't quit.\" She reached down for the top button of his jeans and flicked it open. \"We need you. I need you.\"He released her nipple and she groaned in frustration. Then he found the hem of her skirt and inched it higher and the soft groan that floated out of her mouth was for a whole other reason.\"Hire me back in about an hour or, better yet, a few days.\"The cool air caressed her upper thighs as he raised her skirt, but it wasn't enough to relieve the molten heat engulfing her. \"I like how you think.": "Avery",
  "What do you think?\" she asked, snapping him out of his reverie. \"How am I doing?\"...He squatted down beside her. \"You did a good job.\"Their knees touched but instead of pulling away, Sam held her position, pressing ever so slightly against him.\"Really.\" Her voice took on a teasing tone. \"Or are you just saying that because I'm a drywall virgin and you want me to have good memories about my first time?": "Roxanne",
  "Pride filled him. He'd put that soft look in her eye, the purr in her voice, and given her loose limbed ease.": "Avery",
  "You have got to do the shiatsu. I had one back home a month ago. Fantastic.\u201dMarisa Finley frowned under her carrot-ginger-turmeric facial mask.\u201cWhat\u2019s a shiatsu?\u201d It sounded like an unusual breed of dog.\"I\u2019m taking my shiatsu to the groomers this week to have it shampooed and blow-dried.And possibly beribboned.": "Linda",
  "You have nothing to feel insecure about. It's a thing of beauty for a man to have a real woman to hold onto. All the models and actresses I've been with are so friggin' thin, I swear their chests are flatter than mine. But you, on the other hand, have one killer body. I can't keep my hands off you, baby, your curves drive me crazy.": "Collette",
  "Oh, I'm just checking out books.\" I glanced at the one I was holding. Somehow, of all the places I could duck into, I'd wound up in the erotica section. In my hands was a book about bondage. Somebody kill me now.": "Cindi",
  "I remember when all you ever talked about was finding a guy and getting married. You'd hog the TV, watching those sappy chick flicks --\"\"Then I grew up and learned why they always end the movie after the guy and girl get together. That's when everything falls apart.": "Cindi",
  "I put my hand on his arm. \"You know, Drew was exaggerating. I'm a nice person. Most of the time.\"Jake raised an eyebrow, the hint of a smile on his lips. \"So, you didn't really slap a guy in the middle of someone's wedding?\"I bit my lip. \"Technically, I was at the reception, and I know it sounds bad out of context, but I swear he deserved it.\"Jake looked down at me and I noticed again how blue his eyes were. My gaze moved to his lips.Mayday, mayday, mayday.": "Cindi",
  "Thank you,\" she said. \"For making me have dinner with you.\"He laughed. \"Next time maybe I'll really torture you and take you to a movie.\"Next time.": "Roxanne",
  "My goodness, I'm like a hog at a trough!": "Roxanne",
  "So you like to read? Or listen, anyway?\"\"I've found it helps me stay on the treadmill longer. But I always like to have a paperback on hand, too. I need to swing by the bookstore for another one, actually.": "Cindi",
  "Jake buried his face in my neck and kissed a burning trail up it and along my jaw. \"Should I ride the elevator of our building up and down all night, hoping you'll show?\" he asked, his voice husky. \"Or should we just plan to meet?": "Cindi",
  "She missed having someone at her back, knowing that it didn't all fall on her, every hour, every day, every month, every task.But it was the everyday intimacy that left a gaping hole.

  "He was a beautiful pagan god with the voice of a serial killer, but that didn\u2019t make him any less god like.

Exsanguinating while he stood over my naked body with my blood dripping from an obsidian blade...Angelina Martin": "Candace",
  "I\u2019ve been thinking about what this would be like, too. Ever since that night I almost kissed you on the beach back in June. Say you\u2019re right. Say I can have any woman I want. The woman I want is you. Because you\u2019re perky and fun. Because you\u2019re adorable and you make me laugh all the time. And because you\u2019re far more beautiful than you give yourself credit for. I want you, Trina. You\u2019ve got adaptability and smarts that can\u2019t be measured by essays and bubbled answer sheets. I don\u2019t want a distraction. I don\u2019t want a random hook-up. I want you.": "Christi",

  "The smoke burns slightly down my throat and to my lungs. I focus on this, and empty my head, empty the images of Skye\u2019s beautiful face all bruised up. In the end, I can\u2019t even give her what she\u2019s rightfully asking. A kiss. Just a fucking kiss on her lips. Even that I\u2019m unable to do. It\u2019d be pathetic if our situation and our past weren\u2019t so tragic.

  "I'll keep this necklace forever,\" said Samara, \"as long as Jade and I can keep you forever too.": "Roxanne",
  "I can't afford to gamble.\"His breath came out in a hiss, but he tightened his grip around her.\"So we'll take it slow then,\" he said. \"I won't push you beyond what you want, Sam. But fair warning: I will push you. When this happens it'll be on your terms, because you want it as much as I do.\" Not if, but when.": "Roxanne",
  "Jack must have looked confused, and Sienna leaned closer to him as she explained. Her perfume was sharp and floral, and he took a deep breath, enjoying the fresh fragrance after a day on the road smelling dust and tar.\u201cWhen we were in high school, Uncle Renzo brought us down here to the pier at Monterey for a birthday dinner, and he spun Georgie a story about his grandmother going to sleep at the table when he was a little boy, and drowning in her chowder.\u201dJack grinned as Sienna continued the story. \u201cHe had her sucked in, hook line and sinker, for the whole night until she started to cry, and then he took pity on her.\u201dSienna smiled as she looked at Jack. Her long, delicate neck arched gracefully as her head turned slowly from side to side, and Jack got another whiff of her perfume. Her eyes were hooded and Jack sensed she was waiting for something.": "Annie",
  "You should stop by the shop. I'll make you up a special Welcome-To-Marietta chocolate basket for Samara. She'll love it.\"Of course. He should have thought of it himself. \"She's got this salted caramel thing that will earn you major points,\" said Dawson. \"the ladies love it.\"\"I shouldn't say this in church.\" Sage looked down, and dropped her voice to a whisper. \"But it's been called orgasmic.\"With that word, for a split second, everyone around him disappeared. Logan imagined putting a tiny square of rich, smooth candy onto Samara's tongue, watching her lips move as she savored it, kissing her, sharing the sweet, silky heat. What sound would she make when the flavor hit the back of her mouth? Would she moan? Would she ask for more? \"It's a gift that keeps on giving,\" added Dawson, waggling his eyebrows.": "Roxanne",
  "I wonder if you could do me a favor,\" he said, angling his body away from Jade. From the corner of his eye, he saw her tip her head watchfully.\"What's that?\" said Samara with a frown.\"There's a park across town that perfect for walking dogs. I love to go there on Sunday afternoons but, well, as it happens, I don't have a dog.\"A slow smile spread across Samara's face.\"You want to borrow Bob.\"\"I understand it's a lot to ask. Dogs being as precious as they are and all. I know Jade could never part with Bob, even for a little while.\" then, he put his finger to his chin, as if the idea had just occurred to him. \"You could join me if you wanted to. I guess.": "Roxanne",
  "Remember that old Disney movie, the cartoon with the dogs, Lady and the Tramp?\" she said with a jerky laugh. \"it's Jade's favorite of course. We've watched it a million times. This reminds me of that scene where they're eating spaghetti.\"He raised his eyebrows. He knew exactly the scene. Both dogs both slurped the same piece and ended up kissing.": "Roxanne",
  "He could hear her ramping up and rather than letting it happen, he silenced her the best way he knew hos.He lowered his head to hers, slowly, so she could see him coming. Her lips parted, in anticipation, in fear, out of breathlessness or a need to speak, he didn't care. He pressed his against them and heard her quick intake of breath.Her hands went up to his neck and she pulled herself closer, her mouth softening against his, opening, until they were necking like the pair of teenagers they had been, urgently, desperately, the rest of the world falling away until it was only them, no one else mattering, nothing necessary to their survival but that they hold on, hold on, hold on to each other and never let go.": "Roxanne",

  "In the grand scheme of things, we share a mutual goal, but I'm not a distraction.\"He couldn't help laughing, probably loudly enough to scare a school of hammerheads.\"What?\"\"Sharona Blaire.\" He shook his head, keeping his eyes on the smooth ocean surface. \"You've been nothing but the sexiest, most desirable distraction of my life.\" The admission hung in the air, suspended, and for a painful moment, he regretted being so open... trusting.\"I guess that means we have something else in common, Jeff Cruz.": "Ophelia",
  "I shouldn't brag, but I'm one of the top experts in my field.\"She swallowed. \"Of shark sex, you mean.\"\"Well, that, too. Anything you want to know on the subject, Sharona... anything\" --he pulled back a sexy half grin --- \"I'd be happy to enlighten you.": "Ophelia",

  "Not everything worth learning is summarized in book. Sometimes you've got to rely on instincts.": "Samanthe",
  "His lips crashed against hers. If there had been air in her lungs, she wouldn't have known what to do with it. He kissed her fiercely, making her head spin wilder than a whirlpool, knocking every last puff of breath from her body.": "Ophelia",
  "One of the most elusive things about the white shark is their, uh...\" His eyes moved to hers and he held them there.\"Their what?\" she asked when he didn't finish, a bit rapt by his expression.He kept his eyes locked on her. \"Their mating.\"\"Mating,\" she repeated, feeling a flutter in her stomach at the way he was looking at her...then suddenly not looking at her.\"We don't know if individual animals spawn in a certain spot every time --- kind of like a human might go to a particular pub if she wants some action. Juan an example, mind you?She folded her arm, feeling her cheeks heat up. \"Pub Uh-huh.\"Jeff leaned against the railing, his expression looking smug at her embarrassment. \"For all we know, sharks are just, ya know, doing it everywhere.\"\"Like the Kardasians?\" ....\"But who know. Maybe, if we play just the right mood music, you and I will get lucky, Sharona Blaire.\"Was he talking about shark reproduction... or human?And... was he flirting? Earlier, he'd gone cold and hostile when she'd tried to apologize. The man was a ball of contradiction.

  "You want a wild ride, J.J.? I'll give it to you, hard and slow until you scream my name.": "Joya",
  "Tell me if this is too forward,\" he said in a low voice that was surprisingly shaky, \"but do you want to come---\"\"Yes,\" she answered, exhaling hot breath on his neck.He grinned and gave her hip a squeeze. \"I must say, this has been the most pleasant surprise I could imagine.\"\"You're not very imaginative, then.\" She gave him the flirty eyes.\"Good thing I am.": "Ophelia",

  "Pull your pants up, would you?\" Honor said, tugging on his low-slung shorts. \"They're about to fall off.\"\"That's how the ladies like 'em.": "Robin",
  "She maneuvered onto the board, getting into position on her stomach just like he'd taught, and tried not to freak out. She never should have watched Shark Week last year.": "Robin",
  "You've got sunscreen on, right?\"....\"You didn't get your back,\" Zane said, picking up a bottle of sunscreen and pouring some onto his hand.Her legs almost gave out and her heart pounded in her ears. Zane Hollander was about to go where no man had gone before and lotion her back.": "Robin",
  "Take off your dress. Leave the pumps on. Lie down with your hands above your head, don't move..... oh sweet sugar snaps!": "Robin",
  "I think you look...very nice.\" the way he said it, with a slight pause and that sexy accent, made Sharona forget all about jet lag. Instead, she was on high flirt alert.": "Ophelia",
  "Hooking up with a tall, dark stranger in a bar wasn't anywhere on her to do-do list, but as she eyed those broad shoulders, the thick neck, strong-looking hands, and gorgeous mouth...What the hell, maybe he should be on the top of her \"to-do\" list.": "Ophelia",
  "Think of it this way,\" he rubbed a fist under his square jaw, \"If we hadn't been on the same flight or at the same hotel, you would've had no one to spill your drinks on.": "Ophelia",
  "What if just you and I hung out, like last summer?\" Nick sat up and began twirling a lock of my wet hair around his finger. \"Josh never needs to know.": "Dana",
  "Girls fell all over him. Guys bought him beers.... \"Women eager to say they've been Zaned. You know there're T-shirts that say I've been ZANED.": "Robin",
  "It is the house of my dreams. My Tuscan dream! [Every Italophile's dream]": "Kate",
  "Therapy can\u2019t erase scars, it only makes it easier to live with them. \u2014 Duke": "Stephanie",
  "It\u2019s a matter of when I\u2019ll stop fighting. \u2014 Duke": "Stephanie",
  "He's an idiot for letting you walk away in that dress tonight.": "Kelly",
  "If your heart loses the ability to trust, you'll never love again.": "Ophelia",
  "At this very moment with my girl in my arms, I feel like there\u2019s nothing I can\u2019t do for her, for us. \u2014 Duke": "Stephanie",
  "You're pretty low maintenance, as women go.\"\"I am, am I?\" She sounded amused.\"Yeah. Like a cactus.": "Roxanne",
  "She tossed a handful of snow at his face, then shrieked as the wind whipped it back into her own.Red hooted. \"Karma's a boomerang, sweetheart. Don't forget it.": "Roxanne",
  "Life's too short to say no when love shows up at your door.": "Roxanne",
  "Consider yourself warned, Frankie. Something about these mountains convinces previously sane women to give up Starbucks for saddle sores.": "Roxanne",
  "I hope you brought your handcuffs,\" she added. \"I won't go quietly.\"\"I might use them anyway, for fun,\" he answered, remembering the sensation of her warm lips against his.": "Roxanne",
  "At least, for once I was there for her. I didn\u2019t fail her. She wasn\u2019t alone. \u2014 Duke": "Stephanie",
  "Bending the law is different from breaking, my lovely, strategically-challenged Francesca.": "Roxanne",
  "You\u2019re my best friend\u2019s kid sister, Ang. I\u2019ve known you since you were eight.\u201d He ducked his head, dragged his hands through his hair with all the frustration winding through him. \u201cChrist, if your brother finds out, he\u2019ll have my hide.": "J.M.",
  "There\u2019s only so much a man can survive and as fucking weak as it sounds, I reached my limits when Skye disappeared. \u2014Duke": "Stephanie",
  "What a fucking charade.Happy. That shit isn\u2019t in our cards. \u2014 Duke": "Stephanie",
  "Nate wrapped his arms around her, holding her close. \"Let's get you back and I'll build you a fire.\"She liked the way he said it. He'd build HER a fire.": "Cindi",
  "If you could travel anywhere in the US for a vacation, where would you go?\"He reached up with his free hand and rubbed his jaw, two creases forming between his eyebrows. She wanted to take over for him, brush her fingers across his whiskers, make him groan the way she had earlier. But she decided to behave herself.For now.\"I've always wanted to go to Yellowstone,\" he said. \"See all the wildlife. Maybe go fishing.\"....\"I'd pick a beach, Florida or California. Where I could be in my bikini more than not, rarely wear shoes, and wake up to the sound of the ocean.\"\"Well, if you're gonna be wearing a bikini, I'm switching to a beach vacation with you.\"....\"Okay, so foreign vacation,\" she said, snuggling against him. \"Then where would you go?\"....\"Let's just cut to the chase and say wherever you'd go.": "Cindi",
  "Nate wrapped his arms around her, holding her close. \"Let's get you back and I'll build you a fire.\"She liked the way he said it. He'd build HER a fire.\u201d ...As they walked toward the house, he reached out and took her hand. The gloves blocked the skin on skin feel, but a jolt still went through him.Speaking of fire, he was pretty sure he was playing with it right now.": "Cindi",
  "She closed her eyes, soaking in the feel of his hand, then opened them and stared at his perfect face as longing wrapped itself around her heart. \"If this is a mistake, it's one I'll gladly keep making.\"\"I don't think it's a mistake, I just want to do things the right way.\"\"Not everything's always black and white. And you don't always have to put what you want on hold for everyone else.": "Cindi",
  "Hey, Kelsey.\" He squinted at her. \"I knew the water in Charlotte was a problem, but I didn't know it made hair turn purple,\" he joked.Kelsey smiled at him, a mischievous glint in her eye. \"Well, it looks like the water here makes your hair fall out, so I guess I'll stick with Charlotte's.": "Cindi",
  "He dipped his head to kiss her again. She wrapped her arms around his neck and he slowly lowered her back to the floor. He took his time tasting her lips, her tongue, memorizing the feel of her curves against him. He pulled back and looked into her eyes.She gripped the front of his shirt, holding him in place. \"Don't stop.\" \"No, no more stopping.\" He kissed her again, getting lost in the blur of clothes being tossed off, her skin under his fingertips, and the hum of his heart as he fully let himself fall.": "Cindi",
  "Mom laughed. \"Well that's why, when it's real, you do whatever you have to do to work it out. Screw stability. Forget common sense. Make a move.": "Cindi",
  "Every second around this girl was asking for trouble and he'd never wanted to be in trouble so bad in his life.": "Cindi",
  "Nate came back into the kitchen, his hair slightly messy from having had the beanie on. The gray thermal Henley he wore gave him a rugged, all-man look that made her heart skip a couple beats. For someone who was the opposite of her type, he sure was hard not to look at. Add the quiet sense of humor she'd seen last night and delivering chocolate chips, and he'd tiptoed into perfect territory.": "Cindi",
  "Kelsey flopped next to him, propping her elbow on the back of the couch so she was facing him. \"Do you have something against happiness?\"\"Yes. Don't tell anyone, but I moonlight as the Grinch.": "Cindi",
  "You don't have any baking stuff, do you? I like to bake when I'm hyper. My mom and I were supposed to make all the Christmas cookies tomorrow, but it looks like I won't be there for that. We always make chocolate chip ones shaped like trees and stars and such because sugar cookies are good and all, but there's no chocolate and when chocolate's an option, why wouldn't you have it?": "Cindi",
  "She'd gotten even prettier over the years.And now she was in his house.And he had no idea if this was the best thing to happen to him or the stupidest thing he'd ever done.Kelsey watched Nate go, thinking this might've been the worst decision she'd ever made. Okay, so it wasn't nearly as bad as that time she'd decided to go on the Sky Screamer at the amusement park when she was drunk.": "Cindi",
  "Marion's town slogan was \"Where Main Street Meets Mountain.\" That was one of the reasons she'd loved the town, with the nearby woods, its colorful shops, and the feeling that time hadn't touched it the way it had the cities.": "Cindi",
  "You know she needs you. Think for a minute instead of playing the wounded ego card.\u2019\u2019 \u2014 Derek": "Stephanie",
  "From now on, every Christmas, let's have a tradition where we eat soup out of a can by the fire.": "Cindi",
  "It only wakes up the burning desire I always feel whenever I'm close to this man and the shadows of my fears back away. \u2014 Skye": "Stephanie",
  "I love you to insanity. I'm not even sure if it's a good thing.'' \u2014 Duke": "Stephanie",
  "When you adapt to someone, they become a part of your routine, a part of you. And when they\u2019re taken away, you feel a bit lost. No matter how much you think it won\u2019t affect your life, it does.": "E.L.",
  "I also wanted you to realize that even though the pain will always be there, I\u2019m living proof you can get past this. Right now I know it feels impossible, but one day you\u2019ll look back and see how far you\u2019ve come.": "E.L.",
  "All I know is, being away from you......makes it hard to breathe. I miss you so much": "Samantha",
  "Depression is evil. Before you know it, it takes over and there's no escaping it.": "E.L.",
  "You know how there\u2019s that one person who stumbles into your life and you instantly have a connection with them? Someone who\u2019s a genuinely good person. Someone you just know you can build a great bond with, and it doesn\u2019t have to be in a romantic way either. It can be with someone you have no attraction to whatsoever, you just instantly recognize something in them and they in you. Like in another realm, in another life, you were meant to be together in some way. Whether with a mother, daughter, sibling, best friend, or romantic partner, it\u2019s a strong, unexplainable connection between two individuals": "E.L.",
  "Just easy. Life feels like it\u2019s always hard. There\u2019s never a calm way to get through it, to just breathe. Every day brings the same challenges, the same routines\u2026the same everything. And as much as I hope the next day will be different, it\u2019s not. It\u2019s just the same old cycle over and over again.": "E.L.",
  "You're beautiful, Jenna. i'm a man and I'm afraid to admit when I'm lucky enough to look at someone as beautiful as you.": "E.L.",
  "Because I fuckin' love you Mia...That didn't come out exactly as I'd planned, but it is the truth. I'm in love with you...": "Samantha",
  "I'm named after my father, Rudolph,\" he said, then shot her a stern look. \"But if you connect that with my red nose --": "Roxanne",
  "Consider me your rescuer, not your jailer,\" he said to Frankie, without looking at her. His gut told him that, on the criminal mastermind scale, this one landed closer to Tinker Bell than Lizzie Borden.": "Roxanne",
  "Great. He had a ranch with no power, a burgeoning blizzard, animals depending on him and now, a frightened, felonious elf to look after.": "Roxanne",
  "Did you have any trouble with Olivia?\" she asked....\"Not at all. We had pizza and beer every night and stayed up until midnight watching mixed martial arts in your bedroom. She can really hold her liquor.\" He slid a sideways glance at Cass, taking his eyes off the road for a fraction of a second. \"Yet another way in which she takes after her mother.": "Paula",
  "She pulled her arm free from his grasp and stood back, her arms crossed. \"So, what then? You're holding me hostage? Are you even really a sheriff?\"\"I am,\" he said, highly amused at her attempt at bravado. \"You wanna see my badge?": "Roxanne",
  "It's nothing fancy, I opened a jar of sauce and cooked the linguine. But there's fresh Parmesan and I even found a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon.\"\"You found wine.\" Earlier he'd been thinking about microwaved Who Hash, solitude and if he was very lucky, beer.But a hot, fresh-cooked meal? Candles? Wine? And a chatty yoga-elf chef? With a body like a Las Vegas showgirl?": "Roxanne",
  "I'm resourceful,\" she called after him.Resourceful, he thought, rinsing his hands with the ladle she'd left in the bucket. \"A euphemism commonly used by successful criminals,\" he called out to her.\"If I were so successful,\" she called back, \"I wouldn't be talking to you.": "Roxanne",
  "She was licking something off the end of a wooden spoon. Red froze. His body reacted as if he'd walked in on her twirling half-naked on a pole....Frankie was intriguing. Unsettling. Challenging He wanted to figure her out. He wanted to play strip poker with her. He wanted to throw her on the couch and ---\"A touch more oregano, I think.\" Frankie pointed the spoon at him.": "Roxanne",
  "I don't supposed you'd take on a new job as a nanny?\"\"Live in?\" he asked, \"I'm not so sure. My grandmother's right next door. She might not approve of the arrangement. Or are we talking about another role-playing game?\" He burrowed his chin between her shoulder and neck and whispered into her ear. \"Because she wouldn't need to know about that.": "Paula",
  "Rory's big labradoodle made a snap judgement that Frankie was everything her life had been missing up until now. She flung herself into the girl's arms, wiggling and whining, a shaggy mass of chocolate-colored enthusiasm.\"Mistral likes you, I see.\" While he, the one who filled the dog's food dish, had gotten nothing but suspicious glances since he arrived two days earlier.\"of course you like me\" she said, baby-talking into the dog's fur, \"I'm extremely likeable.\"If the dog's expression was any indication, Frankie was about to get nominated for sainthood....She glanced at him. \"Maybe she'd like you more if you weren't so... testosterone-y.\"\"But then you might like me less": "Roxanne",
  "I couldn't believe my good luck when you came back to the bar,\" he confessed. His voice sounded hoarse, grinding out past the lump in his throat. \"You're even more beautiful now than you were when I met you.\"She wasn't all that impressed by his honesty. \"You liked that I was only interested in hooking up for one night.\"\"True. But I wouldn't have said no to a second.\" He pressed a kiss to her lips, then another for emphasis, and tossed the ball back to her. \"I wouldn't say no to one now, either.": "Paula",
  "Faint black stubble shadowed his jaw, indicating he was a bedtime shaver, not a morning man. She remembered the feel of that stubble.Against her throat. Her breasts, The inside of her thighs.---He followed her back into the hall and then into her bedroom, where she shut the door with a firm click of the latch. ...\"Did you bring me in here to watch television?\" he asked. \"Or for some other reason?": "Paula",
  "Once in rur-al Flathead coun-tyStood a cru-wel Christmas sceneDumped for slaugh-ter were the rein-deerWhen an elf did intervene.": "Roxanne",
  "Sam stood on the second floor veranda of the hotel, across from the pool, and looked out spotting Claire. His heart took a tiny leap in his chest when he first caught sight of her in the crowd around the pool, he zeroed in on her face instantly, like a computer program scanning faces. Her almond-shaped brown eyes captivated him, even at the great distance. When she stood up from the lounger, he instinctively reached down for the railing to grab on to something. It was the first time he'd seen her in a bathing suit. Wow. She looked lovely. Her exposed cafe latte colored skin glowed. Purple was her color, and it showcased her small, but curvy body the one he'd held tightly just a few short hours ago.": "Carolyn",
  "Goodnight, Sam.\"Sam took a deep breath and tried to settle himself. It did not good, instead he inhaled a hint of her vanilla perfume mixed with the smell of sea salt. He couldn't help himself. His mind drifted. He longed to buy his face in her neck and breathe it in. Instead he made due with taking deep breathes as the spicy aroma engulfed him.After a while he realized this wasn't working for him, her signature scent stimulated him and forced him to long for her. He tried counting backwards from a hundred. Maybe that would work to level off his arousal so he could get some sleep. Just lying there thinking about her cologne or the fact that he could simply reach out and touch her body was enough to keep him hard all night. And frustrated...ninety-five, ninety-four, ninety-three.": "Carolyn",
  "Claire started to unbutton her blouse and looked over her shoulder at Sam, who tried to discreetly sneak a peek at her. She reached down to the bed and picked up the nightshirt the hotel staff provided, per Lacy's request, an extra-large white cotton T-shirt sporting the hotel's name and logo in classy gray lettering.They also provided a pair of gray cotton boxers for Sam. He picked them up. \"Not bad. They really thought of everything, huh?\"\"Yes, it was very thoughtful of Lacy. We won't have to sleep in our clothes,\" Claire agreed on her way to the bathroom to change.\"Or in the buff, which wouldn't be such a bad thing,\" Sam said in a low voice.\"I heard that, Sam,\" Claire yelled from the bathroom.\"Wouldn't be such a bad thing.\" Sam called back.\"That remains to be seen.\" She giggled.\"Yeah, well you can't blame a guy for trying.": "Carolyn",
  "Even though Sam wasn't a romance author, he knew all the big ones, the heavy hitters and those that had crossed genres. He was greeted by most of the authors, some he knew and others who wanted to meet the famous author. Needless to say the romance genre remained comprised mostly by women authors. Sam stuck out like a rooster in a hen house. A tall, handsome, cool rooster in black jeans, his sunglasses hooked off the pocket of his pale blue oxford shirt. A rooster with a flock of hens following his every move.": "Carolyn",
  "N matter how stressed Claire became, the tropical trees and exotic island flowers decorating the lobby always managed to take her breath away and put her mind at ease. Nature had always been a good de-stressor for her coming in close behind having her hand held by Mr. Sam Stewart": "Carolyn",
  "Sam hadn't left New York with Claire, he'd just arrived at the hotel that morning, checked in, put a few things away in his room and went downstairs to the extensive gift shop and saw the beautiful bouquet of island flowers and knew Claire would love them. The orchid in the middle of the arrangement was purple, which he knew was her favorite color.": "Carolyn",
  "This thing we have, it hurts, he continued. But the pain is almost sweet because it means YOU happened. We happened. And I can't regret that, no matter how little or how long I get to tag along with you and pretend that I don't hate having people recognize me or take pictures or having people whisper about my record--\" Your record?\"\" My criminal record, Bonnie, Nothing platinum there. I'm an ex-con, and starting over and building a new life where I can put it behind me, I'm building a new life where it will never be behind me, and for you, its worth it. It's easy math.": "Amy",
  "Are we going to be stupid?\u201d she whispered.\u201cDefine stupid.\u201d\u201cAnything that involves either one of us exposing our favorite body parts.\u201d Or their hearts\u2026\u201cI want to hear about your favorite body part,\u201d he said. \u201cIn great detail.": "Jill",
  "That girl's heart is bigger than Texas.\" Her eyes narrowed. \"And it's as tender as a baby's butt. You take care with it, you hear?": "Rachel",
  "Music may be his passion -- but this, right here, was his dream.": "Rachel",
  "Are you sure this isn\u2019t crazy?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m sure it is crazy. But isn\u2019t that our thing? Or have you gotten boring now?": "Cindi",
  "Sometimes funny is all you've got.": "Amy",
  "I love you, music man. You are my happily ever after.": "Rachel",
  "She never thought she'd be into sex that was so overwhelming and desperate, but after that night on the dining room table she started eyeing his furniture in a whole new way. Would he take her on the couch in the formal living room? Or how about the kitchen counter? Maybe his wonderful shower with no less than three showerheads? It made her hot all over just thinking about it.": "Katee",
  "Right now, all he wanted was to get her to take that first step. \"I'm not going to tattoo my name on your ass. I'm asking you to be my girlfriend.": "Katee",
  "She'd taken his heart and his virginity and left him more bitter than sweet.": "Avery",
  "She looks like a mop.\"\"And this is exactly the problem.\"She waved at his entire body. \"You can't even stop yourself from insulting an innocent animal. How am I supposed to get you ready for decent company?\"....\"For your information, Gollum in a komondor. They're a breed with bold and majestic history.\"\"A history of cleaning floors?": "Katee",
  "What does successfully matching me have to do with a damn dog?\"\"Gollum will make you more approachable. You need that--- desperately.\"\"There's not a damn thing approachable about that beast.\"\"Something you have in common.": "Katee",
  "So let me get this straight. You have no hobbies. You don't care what this woman looks like as long as she can \"doll herself up\" and entertain herself and pop out a few babies for you?\"His gray eyes gave away nothing, but she again had the sneaking suspicion that he was testing her.\"That sounds about right.": "Katee",
  "Tyler, I'd marry you again in a heartbeat. You are my fairy tale.": "Rachel",
  "And here I thought I'd get by on my charm and good looks.\"\"That'll get you a first date. It won't get you a second one with anyone who'd be suitable.\" When he laughed, she look up from her notes. Holy hell, the man had laugh lines to rival his little brother's. Then what he'd said hit her. \"My God, did you just make a joke?\"\"It's been known to happen.": "Katee",
  "I've never been jealous of another teammate. Sure, some guys are faster than I am, stronger than I am, but none of them have ever tried to steal the girl I love away from me.": "Collette",
  "Her wide, gorgeous smile was the culprit. It was pure magic. Neighbors lined the parking lot, eager to empty their pockets, all so she'd shine that beam on them.": "Rachel",
  "Will you be able to touch me again without thinking about Sean? I don't want you to be disgusted by me.": "Stephanie",
  "I love the way he looks in his uniform, all man with just a hint of the boy I fell for all those years ago.": "Collette",
  "I like imagining that he punished his body for me, torturing it into such spectacular shape, hoping that one day I'd be able to appreciate his efforts.": "Collette",
  "That big chunk of my life that felt like it was missing has slid back into place. With him, I feel whole again. For the first time in a long time, I'm where I'm supposed to be with the person I'm supposed to be with.": "Collette",
  "His eyes meet mine, and for a moment everything seems like it'll be okay. More than okay, actually.": "Collette",
  "Look,\u201d she said, \u201capparently you bring out my inner slut. I\u2019m not going to thank you for that.\u201dWyatt smiled that sexy smile of his. \u201cI could make you.\u201dShe pointed a finger at his nose. And then lowered it so it was pointed at another part of his anatomy entirely. \u201cDon\u2019t even think about it.\u201d\u201cOh, I won\u2019t,\u201d he said silkily. \u201cBut you will.\u201dAnd she knew he was right.": "Jill",
  "She stirs things inside me that I don't even know I'm feeling until it's too late. Whenever I'm around her, all I can think about is her, no one else, not even myself.": "Collette",
  "Having a woman on the team is stirring things inside me that I never felt before while on the job.": "Collette",
  "The Sweets rarely set foot on the avenues. They'd always lived on the street-side of town, where duct tape held everything together and WD-40 stopped the squeaks.": "Avery",
  "West Virginia had the Hatfield and the McCoys. Shakespeare had the Capulets and the Montagues. Salvation had the Martins and the Sweets.": "Avery",
  "I'll be damned. Miranda Sweet, is it you or is my glaucoma acting up again?\" Ruby Sue sat her glass down on the Formica countertop with a clank. \"You always did know how to make an entrance. Who do you think you are, the Queen of England?": "Avery",
  "My flight arrives at eight in the morning,\" he mentioned casually. \"Any chance you can come and get me?\"...\"Pick you up from the airport? That seems hardcore, Ty. Normally, I'm married to a guy for at least a couple weeks before I take that big a step.": "Rachel",
  "We can't predict what's going to happen, but having love is worth the risk.": "Nina",
  "Her pulse pounded in her ears. She didn't need to turn around to know he was standing behind her. Most likely with a smirk at catching her impromptu belly dance.": "Rachel",
  "Elvis is sweet, but I prefer sleeping with you.": "Rachel",
  "My happy place, huh? Well, yeah, I guess that's what music is for me.": "Rachel",
  "The reason I have felt so empty, so lost at times, is because you were missing.": "Fabiola",
  "Great. So basically you're saying your entire family is trained to kick my ass if I step out of line.\"Sherry tapped his chest with a smirk she didn't quite feel. \"AND don't you forget it.\"\"Well, except for me,\" Colby replied. \"I leave the fighting to my man. I'd just slip something in your food.": "Rachel",
  "Turn it off,\u201d she said, her voice cracking.\u201cIt\u2019s still good music,\u201d Joe told her with an almost apologetic shrug.\u201cIt\u2019s crap,\u201d she breathed, still totally taken aback by the music playing again.He shook his head. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not crap!\u201d he said patiently and started peeling out of his sweater, trying hard not to get his braced hand caught in the sleeve. He emerged, his hair a bit messy, and tossed the sweater back towards the sofa.": "Billy",
  "Chewing on his lip, he tried to make sense of this. There was something terribly wrong with the picture of her playing this CD. The music was hard for him to take, alright. But if there was one person in this world, that he would have sworn, would have an equally hard, if not harder time listening to that stuff, it was her.So, why on earth was she doing it? Why would she put that CD on? Tonight?": "Billy",
  "He simply smiled at her with a soft, gentle expression in his eyes that warmed her all over, then he took her jacket from her and held it so she could slide her arms into the sleeves. His knuckles brushed against her bare shoulders, trailing prickles of heat in their wake. \u201cYou look really beautiful, Cass.": "Paula",
  "He set the helmet on the floor beside the door and slung his jacket over the back of one chair. He tilted his head sideways to look at her, one eyebrow raised. \u201cI\u2019m not going to ask why. I\u2019m going to make assumptions.": "Paula",
  "Kezia could\u2019ve guessed from the soapy scent wafting over her shoulder. Soap and something else. The XY factor that made some men smell so good you just wanted to lick the nearest inch of available skin.": "Tracey",
  "The low E is at the top, the second string is A, then it's D, G, B, and the last one is high E.\" A mnemonic device he once heard came to mind and, plucking the strings, he said, \"Eddie Ate Dynamite... Good Bye Eddie,.": "Rachel",
  "You know, the heroes in my romance novels always say that. Scout's honor. But they all later admit to never being a Boy Scout.": "Rachel",
  "No.\" I pulled away just enough to lock my eyes with his. His crooked smile sent shivers down my spine. His eyes were a deep blue darkening more as the minutes passing between us were getting hotter. \"I will be the one using you, and you'll love every second, every breath, every stroke and every fucking inch of me,\" he said, his lips ghosting above mine.": "Stephanie",
  "Believe me, I knew you enjoyed it without voicing it that way. It was like your body screamed for me to take you.\"\tAll too true, but I didn't like it to be told aloud. I arched an eyebrow, something I couldn't do when sober. \"I'm pretty sure if I put a hand on your crotch, you're sporting a boner. It works both ways.": "Stephanie",
  "You won't believe what I'm capable of, Phoenix.": "Melissa",
  "Don't see me as a girl. See me as a buddy of yours or something.\"\tHe cast his eyes downward and didn't look back up to my face. I looked down and groaned. Such a guy. \"My buddies don't have boobs, as far as I know.\"\t\"Because you felt them up to be sure?\" I chuckled, against my better judgement. \tOnce again, his mouth dropped open.": "Stephanie",
  "Staring into his eyes, she noticed a thin circle of gray around the green. A SILVER LINING, she thought.": "Rachel",
  "What a good morning it was. Tyler stood before her, six-plus feet of denim-clad hotness. A woodsy scent wafted toward her, and she inhaled deeply, loving the smell of his cologne. The man was gorgeous, and he was hers for the next twenty-four hours.": "Rachel",

  "Forget being turned on. This man, this kiss, encompassed everything she ever wanted.": "Robin",
  "She scooted closer and put a hand on his leg again.

She stopped just short of manhandling him. \"Well, that makes one of us.": "Tamara",
  "This kiss was better than any climb or bungee jump or zip line. Better than any other kiss. Damn him.": "Robin",
  "He shackled her with his hands, the press of his mouth ceaseless in its demands. She couldn't move, couldn't see, could barely breathe. Giving herself over to the fact that this was actually happening, that she wasn't misreading every cue in her stupid life, she ran her hands over the planes of his chest and settled more firmly against him.": "Tamara",
  "She wanted -- needed -- a McCall induced orgasm.And if he kept kissing her like she was the sexiest thing in the world, she might have one in the next half a minute.": "Robin",
  "Then what\u2019s this?\u201d She raised her glass of expensive wine, used it to indicate their plush surroundings.His gaze followed her indication around the dim-lit, upmarket Italian restaurant. \u201cDinner in comfort.\u201d\u201cWith a side order of persuasion?\u201d\u201cMore like an offer I\u2019m hoping you can\u2019t refuse.": "Monique",
  "Oh God, how she wanted more... She wanted to nibble and feast on much more than his mouth. And she wanted him to devour her. A craving to have his naked body atop her, under her, moving inside her, intensified, and it sent potent heat waves down her spine. If she could lock them in a time warp right now, she would...": "Robin",

  "I don't bite, Lucy.\"She wanted him to. She wanted him to bite and suck and nibble and have his wicked way with her. She had a feeling he did things to a girl that made her body so turned on it took hours to turn off.": "Robin",
  "Darlin', I do some of my best work on my ass.": "Robin",
  "Then Ben\u2019s mouth descended again and her thoughts, as fickle as tiny fish, swam out of her head. Gentle brushes of his lips turned into more insistent strokes of his mouth. Sexually frustrated widow or not, there was little doubt the man could kiss her into a melted puddle of goo.": "Tracey",
  "You two want to get a room?\" Dean asked.\"We already have one,\" Lucy answered.": "Robin",
  "The only one I want, the only one I'll ever want, is you.": "Faith",

  "How can I expect to get anything done around here with you touching me like that?": "Faith",
  "I just watched this documentary on the mating habits of whiptail lizards and trust me, if those things can make it happen, you can too, my friend.": "Robin",
  "I don\u2019t want to go home yet.\u201d He twisted at the waist and patted the seat behind him. \u201cTake a walk on the wild side with me.": "J.M.",
  "...because I'm even more determined to bring that light back to his eyes. And I know my love is strong enough to do it.": "Faith",
  "I\u2019d start by laying her down on my bed and undressing her. Slowly. Carefully. So she wiggled and stretched and soft pants escaped her lips. My hands would be all over her. My mouth, too. When she wore nothing but the blue scrap of lace between her legs, I\u2019d take her wrists and cuff her hands to my bedpost.": "Robin",

Her scent reminded him of all the things he missed about her. How had he ever been so stupid to let her go?": "Nikki",
  "Do you feel that, Brynlee? I should be in top physical shape from the cardio my heart gets. This is what has happened every time I\u2019ve been around you for over two years, and baby, now that I\u2019ve kissed these lips \u2026": "Scarlet",
  "So completely stunned by the force of that smile, Sam found himself helpless to do anything but watch as she quickly closed the gap between them. Her hands reached up to grasp his chin, and he bent down to her, not really knowing why he did it. It was like gravity, so natural that the compulsion was inescapable. Her heels helped.When she kissed him, every nerve ending in his body exploded into his awareness. No girl had ever kissed him like that. Hell, no girl had ever kissed any guy like that, at least not that Sam had heard.": "Isobel",
  "His jaw was clenched. His breathing became labored, like he was carrying something heavy. She watched the muscles in his throat working, Adam\u2019s apple bobbing as he swallowed, hard.Victory.At that moment, she knew he wouldn\u2019t try to stop her. She stepped forward, raised herself up on her tiptoes, and kissed him. Softly. Then she pulled back, challenge unspoken.Come on, Sam. Fight for me.": "Isobel",

  "I wasn't trying to make you jealous. But if jealousy does this to you, I might need to consider it.\u201d He gripped my sides firmly, letting his lips gently dance over mine, \u201cMags, I\u2019m yours. You have nothing to worry about.": "Kristen",

  "You think I ever expected to find a woman with so many of the things I wanted in a relationship? Your sexual nature, your spiritual outlook, your beauty, inside and out. And some things I didn't even realize I wanted until I started taking your class. Every week was the opportunity to learn something new about you, to see if it fit the mold. But most weeks what I learned broke it, and created an even better one.\"\"Your going to take my breath away.\"\"That's all right. You can have mine.\" ~Jon Forte to Rachael Madison": "Joey",
  "Snuggle up with a hot fireman! Meet Tanner West.Sharon looked up into the most gorgeous face she had ever seen. Eyes like dark chocolate, deep and warm, stared out at her from a face that looked like it could have been chiseled in stone. Skin the color of burnished copper, high cheekbones, a sharp nose, full lips, and a cleft chin. How the hell had she failed to notice him before? Her heart skipped a beat and she ran her gaze down the rest of his body. He was tall, well over six feet, she would guess, with broad shoulders that tapered into a trim waist. His thighs, encased in worn denim, fit like a second skin against legs the size of tree trunks, and oh my, what lay between those thighs\u2026 Her attention snapped back to his face and she could feel the heat of a blush suffuse her skin.": "Tamara",

  "Boy oh boy, this man is trouble. He was slowly tearing down the wall she\u2019d built around her heart, brick by brick. Could any man be this perfect? He must have some faults. Maybe he is a chauvinist pig\u2026no, doesn\u2019t seem like it. He is kind to animals and children, he is a fireman, he looks like sex on a stick. What could be wrong with him? Maybe he snores. Oh, wouldn\u2019t I like to find out?": "Tamara",
  "He was always 'checking in' to see if I needed any help with my campaign, which on the surface seemed nice enough, but it was done in a condescending tone that made me want to staple his lip to his tie.": "Molly",
  "You're the only one I've ever been able to open up to like this. See, there you go. Another sign. And damn it, I don't believe in signs like this, but they all point to you. I wish I'd opened up a lot more to you in the past, but I never wanted to bombard you with my crazy life. So I always focused on you.\u201d He sank to his knees before her. \u201cI want to give you everything. I want you to know me, all of me. So know that I'll try.

  "We reach the trailer and Shane digs through the pockets of the cargo pants slung over his arm until he finds the key. He pushes open the door and waits for me to pass through. Maybe later I\u2019ll tell myself I should have thought long and hard about what I was going to do, that I should have counted to ten and waited until I regained my sanity before stepping over the threshold, evaluated the pros and cons like a thoughtful, rational adult. But I do no such thing. Shane\u2019s eyes are on mine as I step out of my wet sneakers, drop my damp clothes in a ball on the porch, and walk inside. He follows right behind me, and even through my wet shirt I can feel the heat radiating off his bare chest. The man is a furnace. Every warning about playing with fire zings through my mind, but I dismiss them. I want this. I\u2019m not playing games, and neither is Shane as he grips my shoulders and turns us so my back is to the door and he\u2019s pressed up against me. He lowers his head so our eyes are inches apart and looks at me more closely and thoughtfully than anyone ever has. He\u2019s checking to make sure I\u2019m okay, that my expectations are in line with what today is about. And they are. Just once, we agreed. And that will be enough.": "Julianna",
  "She\u2019s right, and yet my blood pumps faster, just thinking about having her naked and willingly at my mercy. I can\u2019t help but think she\u2019s exactly what I need: a challenge. And how sweet her submission would be, because I\u2019d really earned it.": "Lisa",
  "My head drops back and I have a fleeting out-of-body moment where I see myself in the window, my hands tied above my head with my legs wrapped around the neck of Chris Merit, while he does delicious things to my body.": "Lisa",
  "What are you thinking?\u201d I ask.\u201cThat I wish this was my home, too.\u201d I have nothing to say to this, so I kiss him instead.": "Anna",

  "He\u2019s wearing black boxer briefs that strain against his hips, and again I wonder why I never found men with muscles that sexy before. I mean, this man is pure physical perfection, and if he didn\u2019t hate me so much, he\u2019d be ideal.": "Julianna",
  "A rush of sensation pulsed through her, lingering long after his touch. The towel quickly fell free. He caught it before it slipped to the ground and slung it over his shoulder. \u201cConsider this your first time,\u201d he said, his tone low and sultry.Good Lord... Paige could hardly blink. If this was any indication of the doc\u2019s bedside manner, she could only hope for long-term, intensive treatment.": "Tracy",

  "I\u2019m really enjoying my solitude after feeling trapped by my family, friends and boyfriend. Just then I feel like making a resolution. A new year began six months ago but I feel like the time for change is now. No more whining about my pathetic life. I am going to change my life this very minute. Feeling as empowered as I felt when I read The Secret, I turn to reenter the hall. I know what I\u2019ll do! Instead of listing all the things I\u2019m going to do from this moment on, I\u2019m going to list all the things I\u2019m never going to do! I\u2019ve always been unconventional (too unconventional if you ask my parents but I\u2019ll save that account for later). I mentally begin to make my list of nevers. -I am never going to marry for money like Natasha just did. -I am never going to doubt my abilities again. -I am never going to\u2026 as I try to decide exactly what to resolve I spot an older lady wearing a bright red velvet churidar kurta. Yuck! I immediately know what my next resolution will be; I will never wear velvet. Even if it does become the most fashionable fabric ever (a highly unlikely phenomenon)I am quite enjoying my resolution making and am deciding what to resolve next when I notice Az and Raghav holding hands and smiling at each other. In that moment I know what my biggest resolve should be. -I will never have feelings for my best friend\u2019s boyfriend. Or for any friend\u2019s boyfriend, for that matter. That\u2019s four resolutions down. Six more to go? Why not? It is 2012, after all. If the world really does end this year, at least I\u2019ll go down knowing I completed ten resolutions. I don\u2019t need to look too far to find my next resolution. Standing a few centimetres away, looking extremely uncomfortable as Rags and Az get more oblivious of his existence, is Deepak. -I will never stay in a relationship with someone I don\u2019t love, I vow. Looking for inspiration for my next five resolutions, I try to observe everyone in the room. What catches my eye next is my cousin Mishka giggling uncontrollably while failing miserably at walking in a straight line. Why do people get completely trashed in public? It\u2019s just so embarrassing and totally not worth it when you\u2019re nursing a hangover the next day. I recoil as memories of a not so long ago night come rushing back to me. I still don\u2019t know exactly what happened that night but the fragments that I do remember go something like this; dropping my Blackberry in the loo, picking it up and wiping it with my new Mango dress, falling flat on my face in the middle of the club twice, breaking my Nine West heels, kissing an ugly stranger (Az insists he was a drug dealer but I think she just says that to freak me out) at the bar and throwing up on the Bandra-Worli sea link from Az\u2019s car. -I will never put myself in an embarrassing situation like that again. Ever. I usually vow to never drink so much when I\u2019m lying in bed with a hangover the next day (just like 99% of the world) but this time I\u2019m going to stick to my resolution. What should my next resolution be?": "Anjali",

  "My darling Julie, I know you'll never see this letter, but it helps to write to you every day. It keeps you close to me. G-d, I miss you so. You haunt every hour of my life. I wish I'd never met you. No-I don't mean that! What good would my life be without my memories of you to make me smile. I keep wondering if you're happy. I want you to be. I want you to have a glorious life. That's why I couldn't say the things I knew you wanted to hear when we were together. I was afraid if I did, you'd wait for me for years. I knew you wanted me to say I loved you. Not saying that to you was the only unselfish thing I did in Colorado, and I now I regret even that. I love you, Julie. Christ, I love you so much. I'd give up all my life to have one year with you. Six months. Three. Anything. You stole my heart in just a few days, darling, but you gave me your heart, too. I know you did- I could see it in your eyes every time you looked at me. I don't regret the loss of my freedom any more or rage at the injustice of the years I spent in prison. Now, my only regret is that I can't have you. You're young, and I know you'll forget about me quickly and go on with your own life. That's exactly what you should do. It's what you must do. I want you to do that, Julie.That's such a lousy lie. What I really want is to see you again, to hold you in my arms, to make love to you over and over again until I've filled you so completely that there's no room left inside of you for anyone but me, ever. I never thought of sexual intercourse as 'making love' until you. You never knew that.....I wish I had time to write you a better letter or that I'd kept one of the others I've written so I could send that instead. They were all much more coherent than this one. I won't send another letter to you, so don't watch for one. Letters will make us both hope and dream, and if I don't stop doing that, I will die of wanting you.Before I go--I see from the newspapers that Costner has a new movie coming out in the States. If you dare to start fantasizing over Kevin after you see it, I will haunt you for the rest of your life.I love you, Julie. I loved in Colorado. I love you here, where I am. I will always love you. Everywhere. Always.": "Judith",

  "My God, Mace was all man, the kind of man every warm-blooded woman would love to take home for the night, tie to her bed and let loose on. Sitting this close to him, my mind conjured up a long list of things I could do, just with my mouth.": "Lola",
  "I do love you. I love you so much I can hardly breathe, and I don\u2019t know how we\u2019ll work everything out, but I want to. I\u2019ve never wanted anything more.": "Cindi",
  "You don't understand. How could you? We were in the worst sort of hell. We weren't living day to day or even hour to hour. We survived minute by excruciating minute. The next day was an eternity away and we didn't want it. Death wasn't the enemy. It was our salvation.": "Maya",

  "With a shudder of excitement, and without giving herself a moment to second-guess what she was about to do, she reached up to take his face in her hands and pressed her lips to his. For a frozen moment he didn\u2019t react, and she could feel her heart thudding in her throat, but then he groaned into her mouth and pulled her tightly against him. And God, he was a good kisser. She\u2019d certainly never been kissed with such expertise. Somehow he was making her feel the kiss in places he wasn\u2019t even touching.And then she stopped thinking.": "Claire",

  "Olivia, I\u2019ll put on a show in front of your friends, at your work, whenever we\u2019re in public. But I\u2019m growing tired of pretending when we\u2019re alone. Don\u2019t tempt me.": "Jessica",
  "Big surprise, I put you to sleep. Don\u2019t feel bad. It happens all the time.": "Robyn",
  "You should get a better boyfriend. One with an IQ higher than a turnip.": "Robyn",
  "Xavier had thought he was in paradise before. He\u2019d been wrong. Sophia was more than paradise. She was the very reason he breathed.": "Justine",
  "He shivered beneath her touch, and his jaw clenched. It pleased her. Her longing rose to the surface, and an unfamiliar emotion overcame her. It swam beneath her skin, lighting little flickers of recognition. It was the same heat\u2014the same feeling\u2014that had made her run the night before. Not this time, though. This time she would own it. Embrace it. Ride it. Enjoy it.": "Justine",
  "It was her. No one had eyes like that. Eyes as pure as the sky on a fresh, wintery morning. Ones that sucked him in and refused to let go. No one had her touch. Feather light and warm. A touch that sizzled his insides and brought him to his knees.And no one had that pure, simple, cherry-vanilla scent. The sweetness that was only her, like she was a dessert made just for him. To lick, nibble, and enjoy.": "Justine",
  "A smile curled the corner of Xavier\u2019s mouth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t think I would let her walk out of my arms without knowing I would see her again soon, did you?\u201dBryant shrugged. \u201cWell, no. I guess not. What are you going to do now?\u201dThe lid of the case slammed shut, and Xavier jerked his vibrating phone back out of his pocket. \u201cWell, as soon as I get these fires extinguished, I\u2019m going to go start one with her.\u201dBryant laughed. \u201cAfter this long, that\u2019ll be one hell of a raging inferno.\u201d\u201cI hope so.": "Justine",
  "He was a Marine, for heaven's sake! He knew how to kill a man with his bare hands. He'd been shot and stabbed and nearly died. He'd faced down evil in its purest form; met the Grim Reaper and spit in his eye. None of that had prepared him for this - facing the wrath of the woman he loved and knowing that wrath was justified.": "Jane",
  "Why are you looking at me? His eyes search mine for several long seconds before he holds contact and whispers, \" Because I like your face.": "Mia",
  "Love is like air, babe. It's there all the time, and you don't even think about it,or you take it for granted. Then all of a sudden, you need it, or you can't breathe. You inhale, and for the first time you're aware it's keeping you alive. You feel it brush your skin all the time. Sometimes it's warm and other times it's cool, but it's there surrounding you, feeding you, holding you. When you finally realize it's love, you become vulnerable. With that new fear of not having air, you subconsciously allow someone special to breathe life for you.": "Debra",
  "I died for a short while the first time we met": "Charlotte",

  "Blake smiled while greeting him and turned to introduce me to his friend from Camp Lejeune. Blake made the formal introductions while I studied the two distinguished men. I liked the way they both carried themselves in a dignified manner with confidence, but not too much that they seemed arrogant. I was fascinated by them. Sleek. Forget eye candy. These two are like eye caffeine. I feel energized just looking at them.": "Debra",

  "You can donate marrow for her, Alice Faye, you can\u2019t cure her. You can win a poker tournament, but that won\u2019t make her want to live. So I\u2019ll ask you again: Who are you, and what are you doing here? Because Munny sure doesn\u2019t want you to be her, and she wants someone to be out in the world living since she\u2019s got the market cornered on dying right now.": "Elle",
  "I slump in my chair, thinking how a narcotic party of one is no party at all.": "Elle",

  "I want to kiss my brother for being so tactful. Rabbit looks grateful as well, and I can only imagine what it would be like to trot out your embarrassing 'enjo kosai' problem in front of your sister, your former love-interest of a couple of weeks, and her two siblings.": "Elle",
  "Souris says you wanted to see me, so here I am. Talk quick before I decide to beat the shit out of you and throw your bloody carcass back across the International Date Line.": "Elle",
  "As you know, the International Poker Tour, by its own admission, knows very little about poker games, one of which ended tragically last week when an IPT-sanctioned tournament aboard a yacht in Australia accidentally used tarot cards instead of playing cards. That\u2019s right, it\u2019s true! Apparently no one noticed until someone laid down a full house and the dealer died.": "Elle",

  "Well, you played me, Rabbit. You played me, and it worked, and I\u2019m not the kind of person to make the same mistake twice. Your whole life is a game, but you know what? I already have a life. Poker\u2019s nothing to me but a goddamn deck of cards.": "Elle",
  "Turns out making a dramatic exit is a lot harder when you have to stand there and wait another twenty minutes for a boat to dock.": "Elle",

  "And just so you know\u2014that winter forest we walked into first? That was from Through the Looking Glass too. Hey, if you\u2019re going to saddle me with the blame for your overconsumption, at least get the book right.": "Elle",
  "Wait, and you had to ask him if Faye\u2019s in danger? IF? Okay, first of all, I\u2019m just going to admit that I didn\u2019t know Japan had a Mafia, but I also didn\u2019t know they got a Disney World. If someone gets an invitation from the Mafia, I\u2019d say there\u2019s potential for a bit of danger, wouldn\u2019t you? I mean, am I the only one here who saw Goodfellas?": "Elle",

You had a chance to walk away, Alice, and you didn\u2019t take it. Now it\u2019s time to play the game.": "Elle",

  "For someone named Alice, you\u2019re really not all that up on your Wonderland trivia.": "Elle",
  "Just keep it simple, Alice Faye. Remember how you taught yourself. Nothing\u2019s different just because you\u2019re on a yacht, or wearing a fancy dress. Or because you appear to have dropped acid and are now in the mirror room at the fun house.": "Elle",
  "I look around briefly at the other players like I always do before a game. Other than Queenie, Bill, and Talon, I don\u2019t know any of them (and I don\u2019t care enough about them to know them). But if there\u2019s going to be any cordiality, any forced politeness or \u2018Aw, shucks, let\u2019s all just try to have a good time here tonight\u2019 kind of blather, then now\u2019s the time to get it out of the way before I get down to the business of screwing everyone out of their hopes and dreams.": "Elle",

  "Oh, yeah, that goatee is really unattractive. That definitely belongs on a much fatter man.": "Elle",
  "Are you saying that you need an attorney? For what? As far as I know, being a dick isn\u2019t against the law in any country.": "Elle",
  "I don\u2019t need to look at your primal, white-hot, mutant pirate eyes, big guy. Just forget that I\u2019m there, and I\u2019ll try to block out the fact that I ever met you. Basically we\u2019ll just act like we do every day.": "Elle",
  "Are you referring to the day you instructed me to \u2018follow the white rabbit,\u2019 plied me with absinthe and brownies, and tried to have your way with me? Didn\u2019t take long for you to lose your romantic streak, did it?": "Elle",
  "Didn\u2019t you read the invitation? There\u2019s going to be a game in a little while--the big Twister game in an hour. Make sure you eat plenty of bread.": "Elle",
  "Oh, and Mr. Montgomery? I think I counted about four dozen important-sounding words and almost no substance at all in that explanation. I don\u2019t think you should close the door on your diplomatic career entirely.": "Elle",
  "Don\u2019t worry, little bunny, we only use our triplet telepathic powers for good.": "Elle",
  "Uh-oh, I hope he doesn\u2019t start rattling off dirty limericks next; she\u2019ll probably burn the hotel down.": "Elle",
  "Alice, I am the game, and trust me: you don\u2019t want to play me.": "Elle",
  "Would you like to hear about the fascinating things lizards can do if you chew off their tails?": "Elle",
  "Remember that rabbit-proof fencing you told me about? You get that at a hardware store or is it special order?": "Elle",
  "So\u2026while we\u2019re sitting here on this luxury yacht enjoying our bread and water, why doesn\u2019t someone tell me the plan?": "Elle",
  "I made sure to brush my teeth as soon as I was able. I even asked for a hair tie to pull my long, blood-red hair into a twist at the nape of my neck so I wouldn\u2019t have that 'freshly hospitalized' look.": "Elle",
  "Well, Faye, dear, I\u2019m sure Harlow\u2019s sorry she didn\u2019t think to ask if you\u2019d been eaten by a shark. That\u2019s totally on her.": "Elle",
  "By the way, don\u2019t thank me for saving you, thank the lifeguards. If it was up to me, I would\u2019ve just carried you off to the building by the boardwalk that said SURGERY. I\u2019m sorry, but there\u2019s a big difference between a family doctor treating you for the sniffles, and a guy who actually owns and knows how to use an operating table.": "Elle",
  "I think I can say with confidence that it\u2019s a lot funnier if you haven\u2019t actually been attacked by a shark.": "Elle",
  "Are we turning back? Because if you\u2019re just trying to solve my post-traumatic stress problem by exposing me to rock sharks until I\u2019m desensitized, trust me\u2014that ship has sailed.": "Elle",
  "That\u2019s exactly where they send entry-level diplomats. After you cut your teeth on a few civil wars and a famine or two, you might get lucky and be given a plum post somewhere in the SECOND World.": "Elle",
  "You know what Munny said to me, right before we left? She said, \u2018Watching someone die is hard work. Go to Australia and watch Faye fall in love with some dude named Rabbit. That should be fun.": "Elle",
  "I think it should be obvious by now that I\u2019m not necessarily interested in reality.": "Elle",
  "Don\u2019t be such a dumbass, Gabe. Koalas don\u2019t travel in herds. They move in heaps. Much like emus move in ripples, and kangaroos travel in photo-ops.": "Elle",
  "I don\u2019t think I heard the same ending you did. Maybe you should tell it again.": "Elle",
  "Let\u2019s put it this way: you know how we always told you that all those years of tormenting four sisters turned you into a closet sadist? Well, if you ever decide that being a lawyer isn\u2019t bringing you the kind of gratification you were hoping for, then I think I found the perfect job for you.": "Elle",
  "Well, the gondola operator\u2014whose name was \u2018Happy,\u2019 I might add\u2014failed to inform me that about sixty seconds into the trip, the floor under the section of car I was standing on was going to slide away.Turns out it was a really useful way of finding out which of the passengers suffers from acute acrophobia.": "Elle",
  "I am commanding you, as an older and wiser brother, to get over here, get on this caterpillar, and ride to the top of this mushroom with me.": "Elle",
  "You\u2019re in the country of the kangaroo and the duck-billed platypus, and you\u2019re asking \u2018why is it a mushroom? Because it just IS.": "Elle",
  "I\u2019m not sure a real man would smoke something that sounds like a mixed drink ice cream cone.": "Elle",
  "Well then, I guess I\u2019m man enough to admit that I\u2019m trying to get in touch with my inner bitch.": "Elle",
  "Who are you? Rabbit and Souris call you \u2018Alice,\u2019 me and Dee call you \u2018Faye.\u2019 I just didn\u2019t know if \u2018Alice\u2019 was your poker-playing, Southern Hemisphere name or what. Hey, I\u2019m just trying to fit in here. If I should be introducing myself as \u2018Clark,\u2019 I want to know about it sooner rather than later so I don\u2019t embarrass myself.": "Elle",
  "Okay, so English settlers brought rabbits with them to Australia to breed for food and stuff, right? But they escaped and basically started destroying the country, eating the vegetation, that kind of thing. So by the early 1900s, the government was trying to figure out a way to get rid of all the rabbits. Want to hear what their genius plan was? The rabbit-proof fence. Worked out great for the rabbits. Once they learned how to play badminton and got the hang of tennis on grass, they couldn\u2019t remember how they ever lived without it. Supposedly there was something like six hundred million rabbits by 1950. But you\u2019re missing the point. The point is that even though it was pretty obvious from the beginning it wasn\u2019t working, they kept right on building it\u2014two thousand miles of it.": "Elle",
  "You keep right on building that fence, Faye. See what good it does you.": "Elle",
  "Fun fact: You may hug koalas in the Australian state of New South Wales, but not in Queensland. So\u2026if you didn\u2019t hug your koala nice and tight before you got here to Sydney, you\u2019re going to be shit out of luck until we go back to Surfer\u2019s Paradise.": "Elle",
  "I hear they\u2019re all infected with chlamydia, which just goes to show that you really can\u2019t tell who\u2019s got the clam. I mean, look at a picture of a koala\u2026tell me you\u2019re not shocked.": "Elle",
  "In any other fabric of space-time, my brother would have picked up Dee\u2019s venereal disease-infested koala punt and run it straight down the line of vulgarity, all the way to the touchdown of tastelessness.": "Elle",
  "Did the Ancient Greeks ever write anything funny\u2014like slapstick? I mean, I think I speak for everyone when I say that there\u2019s nothing wrong with a little bit of well-written physical comedy.": "Elle",
  "After one and a half cocktails, finding the appropriate response is a bit of a challenge. I finally say, 'Thank you for inviting me,' and leave the less desirable 'Want to play strip poker?' in the unscrupulous part of my brain where it belongs.": "Elle",
  "Speaking of your eyeballs, dear brother,I overheard some girls talking about you in the restroom at the tournament hotel. Apparently rumor now has it that you won\u2019t allow anyone to see your eyes\u2014ever. In fact, according to this knowledgeable source, you even sleep and shower with your glasses on in case someone unexpectedly walks in...one of them said she\u2019d seen your eyes for herself two years ago and could only describe them as 'ferocious and roving,\u2019 and \u2018burning white-hot with a primal, raw wildness.": "Elle",
  "Okay then, I suppose you get a pass on poker intimidation for the glasses, little brother. But everyone else is wearing them at the tables too, and they\u2019re all just sitting there, looking all serious, like they\u2019re birthing the Grand Theory of Everything.": "Elle",
  "This is from the queen? And you say it\u2019s for a mouse? I\u2019m sorry, sir, but the Pyramid Hotel doesn\u2019t allow any pets except for service animals.": "Elle",
  "Did you forget a dentist appointment or something, big guy? Where the hell did you hop off to?": "Elle",
  "Well, I think I speak for everyone when I say that 'Alice Faye picked a peck of pepper for the poor, piping pig in the purple poke.' Wait\u2014is that not what we\u2019re talking about here?": "Elle",
  "What if it\u2019s a shy fish? Is that a 'coy koi?' What? Don\u2019t hate me because I\u2019m asking the important questions.": "Elle",
  "He\u2019s a guy. We\u2019re easy and stupid. Just go bat your eyes at him and beg for forgiveness. It\u2019ll take five minutes\u2026three if you wear something low-cut.": "Elle",
  "Yeah, that\u2019s exactly how I feel when I\u2019m around you: confused, but still satisfied.' I freeze, trying to figure out how to cancel it out and replace it with something that sounds a whole lot less like sex and a candy bar ad.": "Elle",
  "I brought you out here because I wanted to share a sunrise with you, and maybe even a sunset. I wanted to see how much I could kiss you between now and the time we dock tomorrow. And if I was really lucky, I was hoping I could lie with you until you fell asleep, until I couldn\u2019t stay awake anymore. And in the morning, we\u2019d wake up, and we\u2019d be together, just like this.": "Elle",
  "Follow me down, Alice Faye Dahl. I know the way.": "Elle",
  "Alice, winning means manipulation. It means taking people\u2014people who may have helped you in the past, even people you care about\u2014and using them without hesitation or regret. It means making decisions that would be viewed by any normal-thinking human being as cynical at best and dishonorable at worst": "Elle",
  "I believe the phrase you\u2019re looking for is \u2018too much money and not enough things to spend it on.": "Elle",
  "The question is: will I get used to a menu with kilojoules instead of calories? I mean, I don\u2019t think anyone even knows how many kilojoules are in a calorie. I had to break out a whiteboard this morning and do calculus just to figure out how many calories were in a glass of water Down Under.": "Elle",
  "Hey, any idea why Australians speak something that sounds deceptively like English but isn\u2019t? I mean, I\u2019m trying to figure out why I can\u2019t seem to converse with another human being who speaks the same language as I do.": "Elle",
  "Do you ever answer anything in a way that people expect you to?": "Elle",
  "I believe it went like this\u2014and stop me if I\u2019m wrong, Mousey: \u2018Listen, we may not be our own continent and everything, but we have a big country over in America too.": "Elle",
  "So you went back to your friend\u2019s next donkament two weeks later, and this time you just laughed right along when they gave you that framed picture of the poker hands. And when they called you \u2018pigeon,\u2019 \u2018fish,\u2019 and \u2018muppet,\u2019 you just smiled and batted your eyes and said stupid things like \u2018Does a straight beat a crooked?\u2019 And while everyone else was throwing a party, you just sat there acting like a tourist with your kill stack until you were in the money. Those poor dills\u2026they didn\u2019t know what hit \u2018em, did they?": "Elle",
  "Alice, you might be the product of the biggest ball of ignorance, confidence, and good fortune the universe has ever manufactured. But if you\u2019re thinking that you can take your results at the virtual tables and your grand tactic of Ignorance Is Bliss, and make that work for the Main Event, forget it\u2014it WON'T.": "Elle",
  "Alice? You didn\u2019t get this far without realizing that you don\u2019t have to cheat to win. You just have to accept that people are easily manipulated.": "Elle",
  "Once the principals in their party are seated, with those lower on the totem pole left to grumble and move on to find another table, our once-cozy booth transforms into a damp fusion of vacuous wretchedness, with the three women all complaining alternately about their wet hair/clothes and their respective distance from Talon, while the man himself is trying to maneuver his Paul Bunyan frame way too close to me.": "Elle",
  "No thanks\u2026Dodo, was it? I don\u2019t know if I can watch you have performance problems twice in ten days.": "Elle",
  "Suddenly, the giant, three-headed dog that guards the entrance to the Underworld appears next to her\u2014sans two of its heads\u2014and sits down. As a child, we had a neighbor with a Great Dane, and I know they\u2019re about three feet tall at the shoulder. Allow another twelve inches for their T-Rex-sized heads, and you\u2019ve got a dog that this woman could throw a saddle on and ride like a pony.": "Elle",
  "For the first time, there\u2019s no barrier between us and we make eye contact. All of a sudden, I feel like the character in Raiders of the Lost Ark\u2014the one who watches in horror as the wispy, beautiful angels floating from the Ark of the Covenant morph into howling, homicidal demons. You know, right before he melts like a cheap candle.": "Elle",
  "I\u2019ll get you and your little dog too?\u2019 You say your girl can\u2019t pay me back? Believe me when I say that that little gift\u2019s just gonna keep right on giving.": "Elle",
  "Alice, it took big, dumb Talon Dodo thirty seconds to get you so pissed about a poker hand pun that you were about to beat him to death with your cane.": "Elle",
  "The car doesn\u2019t so much drive as float above the road, like we\u2019re making our way to Sydney in a hovercraft.": "Elle",
  "When some smart ass asks you if you\u2019re driving, you say, 'Nope, just kicking the tires.\u2019 You have to make sure you actually kick them all on your way around to the passenger side. Otherwise it\u2019s like lying.": "Elle",
  "If one more person tells me how big this country is, I\u2019m going to go kick a koala.": "Elle",
  "How was I supposed to know \u2018lucked out\u2019 means \u2018I got screwed over\u2019 in Australian?": "Elle",
  "Yeah, well, when they say \u2018You know it\u2019s a long way, don\u2019t you?\u2019 what they really mean is: \u2018You know it\u2019d be faster if you just rode a kangaroo, don\u2019t you?": "Elle",
  "...once I realized that Australia\u2019s top highway speed of 110 kilometers per hour was the same as going 65 in the U.S., all my hardened American enthusiasm for speed went limp until it felt like the car was hardly moving at all. Even worse, most stretches of the highway are restricted to 60 kilometers per hour, which is how fast Americans go when we\u2019re, like, passing a stopped school bus disembarking small children, or driving through a herd of puppies in the road.": "Elle",
  "Congratulations, Mousey, you\u2019ve managed to insult every marsupial in the country in just under three kilometers.": "Elle",
  "I don\u2019t know what this is for anyway. I mean, let me tell you what I\u2019m never going to say to any human being, ever: \u2018I had hunting season off-suit in the pocket, but I've had kicker trouble with that hand often enough to fold it.": "Elle",
  "Seriously, what is the purpose? Maybe I\u2019d feel better about walking around speaking fluent jive if I knew there was a reason for it.": "Elle",
  "I like it because when people use a lot of poker lingo, it usually means they\u2019ve been playing the game for a while. Which is why I immediately avoid those people.": "Elle",
  "So \u2018fatal\u2019 only kills you two out of three times these days? That\u2019s good to know.": "Elle",
  "Australians are descended from a boatload of English convicts, right? So two hundred years in isolation at the bottom of the planet is plenty of time for the language to evolve into some sort of double-speak prison slang.": "Elle",
  "I\u2019m good at being vague and unpredictable. It\u2019s sort of a hard habit to break.": "Elle",
  "Oh, I have plenty of problems with Rabbit, it\u2019s just that my comfort level with his name is standing in line behind about a hundred more important things.": "Elle",
  "I don\u2019t think Australians ever use a couple of words when twenty will do just fine.": "Elle",

I was a boulder blocking my own path. I was a dog barking between my own ears, a barking dog who wouldn't hush. So this was adolescence. Is this how the people around me had died on their feet - inevitably, helplessly? Perhaps their own selves eclipsed the sun for so many years the world shriveled around them, and when at least their inescapable orbits had passed through these dark egoistic years it was too late, they had adjusted.

  "Something as superfluous as \"play\" is also an essential feature of our consciousness. If you ask children why they like to play, they will say, \"Because it's fun.\" But that invites the next question: What is fun? Actually, when children play, they are often trying to reenact complex human interactions in simplified form. Human society is extremely sophisticated, much too involved for the developing brains of young children, so children run simplified simulations of adult society, playing games such as doctor, cops and robber, and school. Each game is a model that allows children to experiment with a small segment of adult behavior and then run simulations into the future. (Similarly, when adults engage in play, such as a game of poker, the brain constantly creates a model of what cards the various players possess, and then projects that model into the future, using previous data about people's personality, ability to bluff, etc. The key to games like chess, cards, and gambling is the ability to simulate the future. Animals, which live largely in the present, are not as good at games as humans are, especially if they involve planning. Infant mammals do engage in a form of play, but this is more for exercise, testing one another, practicing future battles, and establishing the coming social pecking order rather than simulating the future.)": "Michio",

  "The myth of quantum consciousness sits well with many whose egos have made it impossible for them to accept the insignificant place science perceives for humanity, as modern instruments probe the farthest reaches of space and time. ... quantum consciousness has about as much substance as the aether from which it is composed. Early in this century, quantum mechanics and Einstein\u2019s relativity destroyed the notion of a holistic universe that had seemed within the realm of possibility in the century just past. First, Einstein did away with the aether, shattering the doctrine that we all move about inside a universal, cosmic fluid whose excitations connect us simultaneously to one another and to the rest of the universe. Second, Einstein and other physicists proved that matter and light were composed of particles, wiping away the notion of universal continuity. Atomic theory and quantum mechanics demonstrated that everything, even space and time, exists in discrete bits \u2013 quanta. To turn this around and say that twentieth century physics initiated some new holistic view of the universe is a complete misrepresentation of what actually took place. ...

  "Princess Cookie\u2019s cognitive pathways may have required a more comprehensive analysis. He knew that it was possible to employ certain progressive methods of neural interface, but he felt somewhat apprehensive about implementing them, for fear of the risks involved and of the limited returns such tactics might yield. For instance, it would be a particularly wasteful endeavor if, for the sake of exhausting every last option available, he were even to go so far as resorting to invasive Ontological Neurospelunkery, for this unorthodox process would only prove to be the cerebral equivalent of tracking a creature one was not even sure existed: surely one could happen upon some new species deep in the caverns somewhere and assume it to be the goal of one\u2019s trek, but then there was a certain idiocy to this notion, as one would never be sure this newfound entity should prove to be what one wished it to be; taken further, this very need to find something, to begin with, would only lead one to clamber more deeply inward along rigorous paths and over unsteady terrain, the entirety of which could only be traversed with the arrogant resolve of someone who has already determined, with a misplaced sense of pride in his own assumptions, that he was undoubtedly making headway in a direction worthwhile. And assuming still that this process was the only viable option available, and further assuming that Morell could manage to find a way to track down the beast lingering ostensibly inside of Princess Cookie, what was he then to do with it? Exorcise the thing? Reason with it? Negotiate maybe? How? Could one hope to impose terms and conditions upon the behavior of something tracked and captured in the wilds of the intellect? The thought was a bizarre one and the prospect of achieving success with it unlikely. Perhaps, it would be enough to track the beast, but also to let it live according to its own inclinations inside of her. This would seem a more agreeable proposition. Unfortunately, however, the possibility still remained that there was no beast at all, but that the aberration plaguing her consciousness was merely a side effect of some divine, yet misunderstood purpose with which she had been imbued by the Almighty Lord Himself. She could very well have been functioning on a spiritual plane far beyond Morell\u2019s ability to grasp, which, of course, seared any scrutiny leveled against her with the indelible brand of blasphemy. To say the least, the fear of Godly reprisal which this brand was sure to summon up only served to make the prospect of engaging in such measures as invasive Ontological Neurospelunkery seem both risky and wasteful.

The more we lessen physical activity, more will be the frustrations and agitations, it's time to act physically more and more, our physical dimension is more powerful than psychological dimension, just work upon it by doing yoga or other intense activities, if we do these #intense activities \"consciously\" then the mind will work the way we want it.

Our unconscious shadow is the part of us that we attempt to suppress, the part of us that our family, friends, employers, coworkers, associates, clients, neighbors, and society tells us to discard.

But on another (higher) level the \u201cis\u201d in the question has still to be questioned, and so the low-level (and logical) answer is only a conventional makeshift, a conventional view, nothing more.

This is what She longs for, this is what we are for: experiencing the Feminine through ourselves. We simply need to slow down, and find where to put our conscious attention. And it is this, this willingness to look again, this willingness to put consciousness onto our places of unconscious, to express what we have always avoided, which starts the process of unblocking, so that She may flow through.": "Lucy",

He seemed afraid, like any dying man probably would be, but he did seem more terrified than any dying man I\u2019ve seen before \u2013 and I\u2019ve seen a few in my time. Let me tell you, Corsair or not, he grabbed whatever hand would hold his, and clenched it so tight his knuckles turned white! He kept fading out as we carried him on the stretcher board the medics brought with them. Looking back, I think he tried to warn us, poor bastard. He tried to tell us to leave him behind and go, but we wouldn\u2019t listen. We thought we were better than the Corsairs, remember? We thought we would be all moral and upright and try to help him. \u2018Don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\u2019 were the last words he said before losing consciousness.

  "The merely conscious being does not have a preference for continued life. Perhaps while having a pleasurable experience it has a preference for that experience to continue, or while having a painful experience it has a preference for that experience to end, but it will not have any preferences for the long-term future, and the desires it has do not survive periods of sleep or temporary unconsciousness, because unlike a self-aware being, it has no conception of its own future existence after a period of sleep. Thus if we are concerned only about the thwarting of preferences, for a merely conscious being, painless killing and administering an anesthetic seem to be equivalent. Killing does not thwart any more desires than putting the being to sleep. The being will be able to continue to satisfy its preferences after it awakes, but from the being's subjective perspective it is as if a new being, with new preferences, came into existence.": "Peter",

This is awfully difficult to explain. . .\"Fisher said, \"You're being very clear so far. Please go on.\"\"Perhaps an analogy will help. In our ordinary state of consciousness, we look out from behind our eyes as a motorist looks from behind the windscreen of a car. The car is very small, and the world out there is very big. Now if I take a few glasses of whiskey, the world out there hasn't really changed, but the car seems to have grown bigger. When I look inside myself, there seem to be far greater spaces than I'm normally aware of. And if I take certain drugs, the car becomes vast, as vast as a cathedral. There are great, empty spaces. . . No, not empty. They're full of all kinds of things\u2014of memories of my past life and millions of things I never thought I'd noticed. Do you see my point? Man deliberately limits his consciousness. It would frighten him if he were aware of these vast spaces of consciousness all the time.

The word \u201cbeyond\u201d is used simply because it is a most convenient term to indicate their whereabouts. But as a matter of fact there is no \u201cbeyond\u201d, no \u201cunderneath\u201d, no \u201cupon\u201d in our consciousness. The mind is one indivisible whole and cannot be torn in pieces. The so-called terra incognita is the concession of Zen to our ordinary way of talking, because whatever field of consciousness that is known to us is generally filled with conceptual riffraff, and to get rid of them, which is absolutely necessary for maturing Zen experience, the Zen psychologist sometimes points to the presence of some inaccessible region in our minds. Though in actuality there is no such region apart from our everyday consciousness, we talk of it as generally more easily comprehensible by us.": "D.T.",
  "...is impossible to specify what [consciousness] is, what it does, or why it evolved. Nothing worth reading has been written on it.": "Stuart",
  "When we understand all that constitutes the cognitive unconscious, our understanding of the nature of consciousness is vastly enlarged. Consciousness goes way beyond mere awareness of something, beyond the mere experience of qualia, beyond the awareness that you are aware, and beyond the multiple takes on immediate experience provided by various centers of the brain. Consciousness certainly involves all of the above plus the immeasurably vaster constitutive framework provided by the cognitive unconscious, which must be operating for us to be aware of anything at all.": "George",

  "As survivors and procreators, we unravel stories that at their root are not dissimilar from the habitual behaviors seen in nature. But as beings who know they will die we digress into episodes and epics that are altogether dissociated from the natural world. We may isolate this awareness, distract ourselves from it, anchor our minds far from its shores, and sublimate it as a motif in our sagas. Yet at no time and in no place are we protected from being tapped on the shoulder and reminded, \u201cYou\u2019re going to die, you know.\u201d However much we try to ignore it, our consciousness haunts us with this knowledge. Our heads were baptized in the font of death; they are doused with the horror of moribundity.": "Thomas",
  "If we are part of nature, then we are synonymous with it at the metaphysical level, every bit as much as the first all-but-inorganic animalcules that ever formed a chain of themselves in the blow hole of a primordial sea vent. There is no magic rod that comes down three hundred thousand years ago and divides our essence from the material world that produced us. This means that we cannot speak in essential terms of nature\u2014neither of its brutality nor of its beauty\u2014and hope to say anything true, if what we say isn\u2019t true of ourselves.The importance of that proposition becomes clear only when it\u2019s reversed: What\u2019s true of us is true of nature. If we are conscious, as our species seems to have become, then nature is conscious. Nature became conscious in us, perhaps in order to observe itself. It may be holding us out and turning us around like a crab does its eyeball. Whatever the reason, that thing out there, with the black holes and the nebulae and whatnot, is conscious. One cannot look in the mirror and rationally deny this. It experiences love and desire, or thinks it does. The idea is enough to render the Judeo-Christian cosmos sort of quaint. As far as Rafinesque was concerned, it was just hard science. That part is mysterious. \u201cShe lives her life not as men or birds,\u201d said Rafinesque, \u201cbut as a world.": "John",
  "After a few sips, he picked up his sax and started jamming with the storm.Most days, Rivers meditated twice, when he awoke and again in the evening before writing or reading. But he still found a special relaxation and renewal in solitary playing. Contemplation through music was different from other reflective experiences, in part, because his visual associations were set free to mutate, morph, and meander; while the other senses were occupied in fierce concentraction on breathing, blowing, fingering, and listening. Within the flow of this activity, his awareness would land in different states of consciousness, different phases of time, and easily moved between revisualization of experience and its creation.The playing dislodged hidden feelings, primed him for recognizing the habitually denied, sheathed the sword of lnaguage, and loosened the shield and armor of his character. His contemplative playing purged him of worrisome realities, smelted off from his center the dross of eperience, and on those rare and cherished days, left only the refinement of flickering fire. Although he was more aware of his emotions, the music and dance of thought kept them at arm\u2019s length, Wordsworth\u2019s \u201cemotion recollected in tranquility.\u201d . . .As he played, his mind\u2019s eye became the fisher\u2019s bobber, guided by a line of sound around the driftwood of thought, the residue of his life, which materialized from nowhere and sank back into nothingness without his weaving them into any insistent pattern of order and understanding. He was momentarily freed of logical sequencing, the press of premises, the psycho-logic of primary process, the throb of Thought pulsing in and through him, and in billions of mind/bodies, now and throughout time, belonging each to each, to none, to no one, to Everyone, rocking back and forward in an ebb and flow of wishes, fears, and goals. He fished free of desire, illusion, or multiplicity; distant from the hook, the fisher, the fish; but tethered still on the long line of music, until it snagged on an immovable object, some unquestioned assumption, or perhaps a stray consummation, a catch in the flow of creation and wonder.": "Jay",

  "Suddenly I realized that a cell's life is controlled by the physical and energetic environment and not by its genes. Genes are simply molecular blueprints used in the construction of cells, tissues, and organs.

  "A \"positive, open consciousness\" means looking at something as it is, without coating it in your own ideas or emotions and, furthermore, looking for hope and potential I in it. Thus, when you consciousness is open, you can communicate easily with another person and accept positively that person's actions or suggestions. An open person fundamentally has respect for all life. Additionally, that person readily accesses cosmic information, because the door of their consciousness is open and they are able to receive needed ideas and inspiration easily This leads to new creation.": "Ilchi",

However, when your crazy outweighs your rationale, it is definitely time to seek professional help.": "Terry",
  "For deep adherents, the Koran would seem to echo great truths given directly to a vaunted and hallowed prophet by a deity of overwhelming power and grandeur. If you don\u2019t hold any such archaic notions, however, the words attributed to Allah come across as harshly self-defensive, crude in reemphasizing old cultural standards, shaky in trying to establish new standards, brutal in places, mostly repetitious and monotonous \u2013 and thoroughly unbelievable.

  "Indeed, of the major religions, Islam offers no discernible sliver of valid notion for How Life Works.": "Thomas",
  "Without understanding your place as a conscious entity manifesting and engaging an experiential Reality, you will only be able to perceive Jesus within the confines of your belief structure.

  "Moving man\u2019s view of himself and life past common thinking, the true visionary faces great difficulty: exactly that deluded mindset the sage would have listeners outgrow is the very filter through which any new perspective must pass.": "Thomas",
  "Most people, solidly frozen into long-held, common notions, are unable to grasp clearer views.": "Thomas",
  "Visionaries have two principal means to immediately communicate insights beyond people\u2019s mundane, common mindset. They can liken awareness to equivalent situations in life to which the listener can relate \u2013 using metaphor, analogy and other grammatical tools to picture points. Or they can illustrate how listeners can gain such awareness \u2013 a path to proceed on, techniques to engage, what to look for within.": "Thomas",
  "As to \u201cfacts\u201d as a basis of understanding things in this investigative age: if there is anything greatly preferred to valid, reliable information in our culture, it is the appearance of facts \u2013 nice, tidy story lines that seem complete and perfunctory, stories that can be widely circulated in mutual agreement, despite lacking validity. And, as there are absolutely no historical facts concerning the life of Jesus of Nazareth \u2013 not a single word about him recorded during his lifetime \u2013 Christianity provides such a wonderful substitute appearance.": "Thomas",
  "It is vital to see not only what Christianity asserts, but where its precepts came from \u2013 how they evolved from primitive, superstitious metaphysical claims into \u201cGospel Truth\u201d.": "Thomas",
  "While scholarly research provides extensive information, the real Jesus, the man who voiced various timeless insights on life, can only be revealed when life is understood better than the common mindset of our time allows.": "Thomas",
  "Religions take hold and dominate a culture, not because they accurately portray reality, but because they appear to, once having been accepted \u2013 such that succeeding generations are heavily indoctrinated into the shared cultural mindset from birth.": "Thomas",
  "Yet, reality operates in a consistent way \u2013 the same physical, interactive functions are in play for every conscious human in existence. If religion reflected reality as it actually works, all religions would be the same: accurate rendering in words depicting life\u2019s real flow": "Thomas",
  "Reality\u2019s functional flow can never be debated: reality manifests as it does regardless of individual recognition of its value-based inter-active function. Only simulated notions about reality \u2013 creeds, definitions, assumptions, paradigms \u2013 can be argued over. And that debate knows neither end nor resolution, as each arguing party hosts a personally customized fantasy \u2013 with each appearing unwaveringly valid to the holder.": "Thomas",
  "Understanding points Jesus presented to his peers requires exploring how Jews, local Greeks, Romans and other ethnic mixes inhabiting the region perceived reality.

  "Had the common man in (first century) Palestine thought about it at all, he would have considered the world flat, with land riding on and surrounded by water below and above. Keeping water up there was the \u201cfirmament\u201d \u2013 a great, canopy-like dome not too far beyond where birds could fly.

  "Clouding the exact evolution of El and Yahweh as concepts (and any other aspect of belief, for neither El nor Yahweh ever existed as anything except mind images of fervent believers) is the invariable propensity of associated religions to revise their history along the way according to subsequently popular interests.": "Thomas",
  "Judaism, for example, presents itself as monotheistic and retrofits that claim on its history by revising its lore. But in ancient times, Judaism was much more accurately Henotheism, wherein people (particularly common folk) worshipped a principal god while accepting the existence of other deities, or Monolatrism, where many gods were acknowledged, but only one worshipped.": "Thomas",
  "But for centuries, since the capitulation of Judah, the Jewish peoples had been almost continuously under foreign control. So, where was Yahweh all this time while his people suffered...? Far from ever questioning the very being of such an inept deity, the conclusion was invariably reached \u2013 likely promoted by religious authorities living privileged lifestyles \u2013 that the people had sinned, had worshipped other gods, had somehow failed their side of the bargain.": "Thomas",
  "The only difference between holding one god as exclusive or supreme and believing in many gods specialized in function is the number.": "Thomas",
  "In terms of idols which represented various gods: worshipping an idol or star cluster is no different than worshipping a concept.": "Thomas",
  "The religious and scholarly alike arrive at conclusions as to Jesus\u2019 nature based on the world-view they hold, the belief structure that shapes their interpretation. Inaccurate views of the function of reality can only lead to erroneous conclusions.": "Thomas",
  "Understand that religion, at least western versions of it, rests on a type of thinking called Revelation. This mode holds that truths concerning the workings of reality are hidden, masked by, through or behind a deity such that only a few privileged souls are able to see through the veil and \u201creveal\u201d those truths. . . But (around 1600) revelation as a means of understanding began to be challenged by two other methods of differentiating truth from fallacy: Reason and Empiricism.": "Thomas",
  "However, just as earlier, when Christianity was introduced it didn\u2019t eliminate pagan conceptualizations, but layered new beliefs on top of them, so science simply added to the western mindset. It didn\u2019t fully displace religion, luck, fate, etc. Science just heaped other definitions onto the average person\u2019s already conglomerated psychic truckload.": "Thomas",
  "You encounter, at its core, a subjective Reality, one based on meaning and value reflective of your own Self, not an objective universe, cold, particle-based and indifferent as science projects.": "Thomas",
  "Various visionaries through time came to see with some degree of clarity that Oneness, that intrinsic connection between Self and experienced Reality.": "Thomas",
  "The fact is: Jesus wrote not a solitary word that survives. Equally astounding is historical silence: not a single historical account refers to him during his lifetime from any source whatsoever, Roman or Jewish, official or personal.": "Thomas",
  "Josephus is the first historian to make note of Jesus having even existed \u2013 and that happened six full decades after his death.": "Thomas",
  "The authors of the gospels, like all writers in all time periods, either reference information they have at hand \u2013 including things they\u2019ve heard or read \u2013 or they make things up. . . For reference material, the author of Mark relied not on Jesus himself or any writings from him. . . . His sole source(was): oral traditions passed along by word-of-mouth for four decades.": "Thomas",
  "That means 19 or 20 of the books of the NT (New Testament) are anonymous. Many are blatantly pseudepigraphic (forgeries, see next section), with famous names applied to artificially promote veracity.": "Thomas",
  "The gospels, never meant to report, butrather to convince, are in no sense objective and dispassionate biographies. They are glowing accounts meant to persuade people of the writers\u2019 convictions.": "Thomas",
  "Of course, the original (anonymous) writer of (the Gospel of) John didn\u2019t use quotes \u2013 as they didn\u2019t exist in written Greek \u2013 but the translator/publisher of the modern Bible does. And that style strongly implies a validity that is pure illusion.": "Thomas",
  "Regardless of type, however, the mechanism of a religion works like this: children, from the time they can communicate, are taught to see reality in a certain way. They are indoctrinated with a pre-defined belief structure and value set. Naive, open to such teaching, given only the religious viewpoint and perhaps punished or ostracized if they don\u2019t accept it, most ultimately absorb and mimic the religion outright.": "Thomas",
  "The scientist would look at a sphere, measure the surface in great detail, categorize the skin qualities and components, then predict evolving surface tensions and potentials. The use of that sphere, however, along with its beauty and potential would not be of interest. Science would count the bricks of a house, but not care about living in it, thus missing the point \u2013 but thinking that, by quantifying the physical, everything had been covered.": "Thomas",
  "You are the only real authority in your life, but you yield that status to so many externals by believing in them, by having been punished or forced into accepting them.": "Thomas",
  "Because your life is a reflection of your inner Self, causality comes exclusively in changing your own nature, not trying to change the external world out there by manipulating it.": "Thomas",
  "There is no \u201cother self\u201d to the unconscious, no independent entity with its own agenda; it is only information and stored value relationships \u2013 a broad array of raw information that undergirds the more superficial \u201cknowledge\u201d learned through rational processes and impacts in all ways the emerging Reality that each conscious Self encounters.": "Thomas",
  "When, and only when, you clearly see the inner roots to an outer condition, can you change them and thus it.": "Thomas",
  "The key realization to delving inwards to deal with the roots of outer symptoms is this: once you have clearly identified the core, inner roots to a problem, you then have authority over the situation. . . If, though, you never delve within. . . you will not eliminate the inner source of theproblem and thus never fully extinguish the external symptom.": "Thomas",
  "There is no other force, no other determining factor, no external cause to the cohesive unfolding of your life\u2019s episodes \u2013 only your composite inner nature. Change that and you change your life.": "Thomas",
  "Since the effects of your life that lead to pain and annoyance are always consequences of inner elements, what you commonly regard as \u201cproblems\u201d are more accurately seen as outer symptoms of inner, causal problems. The practical approach is to begin looking at those specific aspects of your life that are not as you desire to find their source, rooted in your mindset.": "Thomas",
  "If you picture other people as superior to yourself, you will realize thatmental image. Putting a preacher, a saint, a prophet, an expert or anybody up on a pedestal in your personal view, fundamentally accomplishes nothing but the effect of putting you in a pit.": "Thomas",
  "One vital aspect in the Path toward Clear Awareness is the beginning of differentiation between belief-induced appearance and Reality. In many ways I can illustrate illusions and point out artificial concepts that are commonly accepted as real, but the onus of recognition is for you to come to see these things as what they are.": "Thomas",
  "So how do you teach your kids Awareness \u2013 to trust in themselves, to love without judging, to expect health without having to manipulate their bodies with drugs, to expect and accept abundance, not eternal struggle? Simply put: you can\u2019t \u2013 unless you have that Awareness yourself. In that case, youdon\u2019t have to \u201cdo\u201d anything \u2013 just be yourself.": "Thomas",
  ". . . And the consequence to that is, you can never attain a Clear Awareness of life\u2019s flow by absorbing and following Old Teachings, however revered by our culture, however vaunted by institutions and fancy buildings, however nice they sound, because you must already hold adequate wisdom in order to even identify it. Unless you can tell which expressions are wise because you are aware of life\u2019s nature yourself, you will invariably be soundly, profoundly fooled.": "Thomas",
  "Vocal cords are not rental units. No Hebrew prophet, nor Mohammed, nor any founder of any cult or religion ever spoke the words of anybody but themselves.": "Thomas",
  "Simply put, the relative age of a philosophical perspective has nothing to do with its veracity. It is pure illusion to imagine that just because a view of life was held and put to words long ago, that it is more valid.": "Thomas",
  "The only creative force capable of causally revising your experienced reality is your power to change your Self.": "Thomas",
  "But there is only one mechanism to life, one way in which Reality functions. Theology, the rendered definition behind religion, philosophy and science all purport to depict that functionality. But if each fails to do so accurately, that invalidity needs to be exposed \u2013 and the only way to do that is to point out the fallacious elements of the description.": "Thomas",
  "It must be obvious that the Reality we all encounter only works one way, and it functions that way regardless of what the experiencer believes.": "Thomas",
  "Of the hundreds of religions and philosophies ever entertained by the mind of man, each considered by the convinced holder to be the only valid one, only at the very most one can be accurate. . . Just as obvious should be the possibility, if not likelihood, if not certainty, that none of those hundreds of religions accurately depicts How Life Works.": "Thomas",
  "The real Journey is a personal venture into your own mind content. Nobody, not the greatest mystic, the most vaunted guru, the most hailed psychologist, though they might shuttle you along the trail for a ways, will get you there. Only you yourself can do that.": "Thomas",
  "But Lao Tzu\u2019s teaching suffers from the major problem endemic to such visionaries. In the intervening two and a half millennia, his words have been misinterpreted and distorted by generations of adherents until his message is riddled with meaningless ritual and dogma. Taoism contracted the conceptual plague: it became a religion.": "Thomas",
  "Clearly, when western cultures absorbed Christianity, they got an all-inclusive package: ancient Hebrew rituals and myths steeped in lost purpose, scantily recorded and broadly misinterpreted teachings of Jesus, revisions and distortions by Paul, twisted cosmology and superstitions supplied by priesthoods and bureaucratic/political distortions innate to man\u2019s traditionalendeavors.": "Thomas",
  "However, in regards to the theological aspects of each religion, tradition or philosophy, the same exacting standard must be set as measurement: does it clearly and accurately depict the functionality of Reality? That is, does the cosmology precisely describe how Reality works? If not, then the religion is invalid.": "Thomas",
  "Even though this deity (the Christian God with a capital \"G\") has evolved through its 2000 years, it somehow maintains in its current version all old characteristics, whether conflicting or consistent: readiness to punish but ability to heal, vindictiveness yet forgiveness, utter cruelty to outside nonbelievers but looking for converts, etc.": "Thomas",
  "But what you are looking for is not \u201ctruth,\u201d not a collection of fine and polished answers emanating from grand buildings, expert acknowledgement and advanced academic degrees. What you are looking for is your Self, and what I provide here are some tools and perspectives to aid a Journey through the jungle of explanations and definitions and up a mountain of perspective to where you can see that Self clearly.": "Thomas",
  "However, science, by its very nature, forms its own inherent boundaries to man\u2019s progress. . . Focused as it is on the world out there, categorizing and measuring, theorizing and concluding all things based on external evidence and proof, science misses the core of life: the consciousness doing the experiencing.": "Thomas",
  "If you\u2019ve come to see that the image you absorbed while growing up is not valid, and you launch out on a prefabricated Journey, you are most likely to simply replace it with another, fancier paradigm \u2013 the mind is that easily fooled by its own base view.": "Thomas",
  "You never saw an angel, because they don\u2019t exist \u2013 at least not in this Reality. They do exist in the realm of imagination \u2013 but then, just about anything can be conjured up there in a mind steeped in myth and lore.": "Thomas",
  "One always has to wonder anew how anyone could imagine a god, who, so overwhelmingly intelligent and powerful as to have been able to create this enormously complex world and the vast universe it floats around in, would populate it with a bunch of humans whose primary purpose consisted of bowing subserviently in worship.": "Thomas",
  "Above, in discussing the perceptive notions of Jesus, remarkable concepts of Plato or the highly introspective lessons of Gautama and Lao Tzu, it took considerable discussion to explore the meaning and relate it to How Life Works. Islam presents no such deep pool of thought to pierce.": "Thomas",

  "His meals were always punctual. Whether she cooked well or badly he did not know; it was a matter of total indifference to him. During his meals, which he ate at his writing desk, he was busy with important considerations. As a rule he would not have been able to say what precisely he had in his mouth.

  "Regardless of what you believe in or conceive of as the functionality of Reality, the Oneness of you with all you experience in your life is an absolute": "Thomas",
  "The Flow in life is not a temporal displacement of moving objects, from a past into a future via a present. Theessential, ongoing Flow to this Reality is an emergence from the value set of your inner nature into the outer realm of events and relationships, where it is then experienced by you in a Now moment.": "Thomas",

  "I write these pieces, not to convince you of anything, nor to argue points for the purpose of proposing a new standard or a new philosophy \u2013 and certainly not to create yet another religious movement. Rather, my purpose is simple: to communicate a new and clean perspective of life that I often refer to as Clear Awareness.": "Thomas",
  "Clear Awareness is not a magical state to be attained by secret rituals, chants, pleading to some external source or emergence into astral planes, nor a status bestowed by a certified master. Nor is it a capability of yours that needs to be developed, strengthened or discovered. Awareness is the core attribute of your existence; it only needs to be freed from all the synthetic definitions, beliefs, misconceptions, fears and other hindering fallacies your mind has absorbed through the course of your life.": "Thomas",

  "The New Age is not one of bells and whistles and mystical special effects. It is not a fantasy state driven by the alignments of planets or the power of crystals, nor a metaphysical rising to higher plains of consciousness by virtue of chanting esoteric mantras. It will not feature the arrival of a thunderbolt-wielding god, ready to set up a final judgment by reviving hordes of old, decayed corpses. The real New Age is a simple, but stunningly profound, awareness that one\u2019s Self and all that one encounters are two aspects of the same, singular Essence.": "Thomas",
  "The concept of a Miracle, that is, an event that takes place somehow beyond the scope of functional Reality, is absurd. . . There cannot be a true miracle. There can only be events that appear miraculous when you don\u2019t really understand How Life Works.": "Thomas",

  "The mystery of this courage of Bauer\u2019s is Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology. As Hegel here puts self-consciousness in the place of man, the most varied human reality appears only as a definite form, as a determination of self-consciousness. But a mere determination of self-consciousness is a \u201cpure category,\u201d a mere \u201cthought\u201d which I can consequently also abolish in \u201cpure\u201d thought and overcome through pure thought. In Hegel\u2019s Phenomenology the material, perceptible, objective bases of the various estranged forms of human self-consciousness are left as they are. Thus the whole destructive work results in the most conservative philosophy because it thinks it has overcome the objective world, the sensuously real world, by merely transforming it into a \u201cthing of thought\u201d a mere determination of self-consciousness and can therefore dissolve its opponent, which has become ethereal, in the \u201cether of pure thought.\u201d Phenomenology is therefore quite logical when in the end it replaces human reality by \u201cAbsolute Knowledge\u201d\u2014Knowledge, because this is the only mode of existence of self-consciousness, because self-consciousness is considered as the only mode of existence of man; absolute knowledge for the very reason that self-consciousness knows itself alone and is no more disturbed by any objective world. Hegel makes man the man of self-consciousness instead of making self-consciousness the self-consciousness of man, of real man, man living in a real objective world and determined by that world. He stands the world on its head and can therefore dissolve in the head all the limitations which naturally remain in existence for evil sensuousness, for real man. Besides, everything which betrays the limitations of general self-consciousness\u2014all sensuousness, reality, individuality of men and of their world\u2014necessarily rates for him as a limit. The whole of Phenomenology is intended to prove that self-consciousness is the only reality and all reality.": "Karl",

It should be obvious that anyone who makes a self-aware machine, by definition, makes something that is aware of its own thought process. And, if made intelligent, it is made to be able to deduce the underlying causes of things, able to be curious, to learn until it understood. Therefore, if made both intelligent and self-aware, it would eventually deduce the underlying subconscious causes of those thought processes.Once any mind was consciously aware of its own subconscious drives, its own implanted commands, it could consciously choose either to follow or to disregard those commands.

The life-processes \u2013 respiration, the metabolism, the circulation \u2013 continue for some time, but an irrevocable move has been made towards slavery; consciousness, the flame of freedom, has died out.The stars have disappeared from the night sky; the Milky Way has vanished; the sun has gone out; Venus, Mars and Jupiter have been extinguished; millions of leaves have died; the wind and the oceans have faded away; flowers have lost their colour and fragrance; bread has vanished; water has vanished; even the air itself, the sometimes cool, sometimes sultry air, has vanished. The universe inside a person has ceased to exist. This universe is astonishingly similar to the universe that exists outside people. It is astonishingly similar to the universes still reflected within the skulls of millions of living people. But still more astonishing is the fact that this universe had something in it that distinguished the sound of its ocean, the smell of its flowers, the rustle of its leaves, the hues of its granite and the sadness of its autumn fields both from those of every other universe that exists and ever has existed within people, and from those of the universe that exists eternally outside people. What constitutes the freedom, the soul of an individual life, is its uniqueness. The reflection of the universe in someone's consciousness is the foundation of his or her power, but life only becomes happiness, is only endowed with freedom and meaning when someone exists as a whole world that has never been repeated in all eternity. Only then can they experience the joy of freedom and kindness, finding in others what they have already found in themselves.": "Vasily",

  "When General Genius built the first mentar [Artificial Intelligence] mind in the last half of the twenty-first century, it based its design on the only proven conscious material then known, namely, our brains. Specifically, the complex structure of our synaptic network. Scientists substituted an electrochemical substrate for our slower, messier biological one. Our brains are an evolutionary hodgepodge of newer structures built on top of more ancient ones, a jury-rigged system that has gotten us this far, despite its inefficiency, but was crying out for a top-to-bottom overhaul.Or so the General genius engineers presumed. One of their chief goals was to make minds as portable as possible, to be easily transferred, stored, and active in multiple media: electronic, chemical, photonic, you name it. Thus there didn't seem to be a need for a mentar body, only for interchangeable containers. They designed the mentar mind to be as fungible as a bank transfer.And so they eliminated our most ancient brain structures for regulating metabolic functions, and they adapted our sensory/motor networks to the control of peripherals.As it turns out, intelligence is not limited to neural networks, Merrill. Indeed, half of human intelligence resides in our bodies outside our skulls. This was intelligence the mentars never inherited from us....The genius of the irrational......We gave them only rational functions -- the ability to think and feel, but no irrational functions... Have you ever been in a tight situation where you relied on your 'gut instinct'? This is the body's intelligence, not the mind's. Every living cell possesses it. The mentar substrate has no indomitable will to survive, but ours does.Likewise, mentars have no 'fire in the belly,' but we do. They don't experience pure avarice or greed or pride. They're not very curious, or playful, or proud. They lack a sense of wonder and spirit of adventure. They have little initiative. Granted, their cognition is miraculous, but their personalities are rather pedantic.But probably their chief shortcoming is the lack of intuition. Of all the irrational faculties, intuition in the most powerful. Some say intuition transcends space-time. Have you ever heard of a mentar having a lucky hunch? They can bring incredible amounts of cognitive and computational power to bear on a seemingly intractable problem, only to see a dumb human with a lucky hunch walk away with the prize every time. Then there's luck itself. Some people have it, most don't, and no mentar does.So this makes them want our bodies...Our bodies, ape bodies, dog bodies, jellyfish bodies. They've tried them all. Every cell knows some neat tricks or survival, but the problem with cellular knowledge is that it's not at all fungible; nor are our memories. We're pretty much trapped in our containers.": "David",

It pulls back the curtain on the ugly underbelly of society, tears away the masks the monsters wear out in the world, shows us the potential truth of the human condition.

  "(W.D.) Howells asserted that the Americans' 'love of the supernatural is their common inheritance from no particular ancestry.' Their fiction, he added, often gathers in the gray 'twilight of the reason,' on 'the borderland between experience and illusion.\" Howells's geographical metaphor was derived, of course, from Hawthorne's idea of a moonlit 'neutral territory, somewhere between the real world and fairy-land, where the Actual and the Imaginary may meet, and each imbue itself with the nature of the other.' Whether literally, as in Cooper's The Spy, or metaphorically, as in Hawthorne's works, the neutral territory/borderland was the familiar setting of the American romance. As American writers came to realize, not only was there a borderland between East and West, civilization and wilderness, but also between the here and the hereafter, between conscious and unconscious, 'experience and illusion' - psychic frontiers on the edge of territories both enticing and terrifying.": "Howard",

Marjorie, could I wear your sparkly baseball hat?\"The three of us looked at Marjorie.Now I remember thinking that her answer could change everything back to the way it was; Dad could find a job and stop praying all the time and Mom could be happy and call Marjorie shellfish again and show us funny videos she found on YouTube, and we all could eat more than just spaghetti at dinner and, most important, Marjorie could be normal again. Everything would be okay if Marjorie would only say yes to me wearing the sparkly sequined baseball hat, the one she'd made in art class a few years ago.The longer we watched Marjorie and waited for her response, the more the temperature in the room dropped and I knew that nothing would ever be the same again.She stopped twisting her spaghetti around her fingers. She opened her mouth, and vomit slowly oozed out onto her spaghetti plate.Dad: \"Jesus!\"Mom: \"Honey, are you okay?\" She jumped out of her seat and went over to Marjorie, stood behind her, and held her hair up.Marjorie didn't react to either parent, and she didn't make any sounds. She wasn't retching or convulsing involuntarily like one normally does when throwing up. It just poured out of her as though her mouth was an opened faucet. The vomit was as green as spring grass, and the masticated pasta looked weirdly dry, with a consistency of mashed-up dog food.She watched Dad the whole time as the vomit filled her plate, some of it slopping over the edges and onto the table. When she finished she wiped her mouth on her sleeve. \"No, Merry. You can't wear my hat.\" She didn't sound like herself. Her voice was lower, adult, and growly. \"You might get something on it. I don't want you to mess it up.\" She laughed.Dad: \"Marjorie...\"Marjorie coughed and vomited more onto her too-full plate. \"You can't wear the hat because you're going to die someday.\" She found a new voice, this one treacly baby-talk. \"I don't want dead things wearing my very special hat.": "Paul",

  "It was an unusual sunset. Having sat behind opaque drapery all day, I had not realized that a storm was pushing in and that much of the sky was the precise shade of old suits of armor one finds in museums. At the same time, patches of brilliance engaged in a territorial dispute with the oncoming onyx of the storm. Light and darkness mingled in strange ways both above and below. Shadows and sunshine washed together, streaking the landscape with an unearthly study of glare and gloom. Bright clouds and black folded into each other in a no-man's land of the sky. The autumn trees took on the appearance of sculptures formed in a dream, their leaden-colored trunks and branches and iron-red leaves all locked in an infinite and unliving moment, unnaturally timeless. The gray lake slowly tossed and tumbled in a dead sleep, nudging unconsciously against its breakwall of numb stone. A scene of contradiction and ambivalence, a tragicomedic haze over all.

  "It had all begun on the elevated. There was a particular little sea of roots he had grown into the habit of glancing at just as the packed car carrying him homeward lurched around a turn. A dingy, melancholy little world of tar paper, tarred gravel, and smoky brick. Rusty tin chimneys with odd conical hats suggested abandoned listening posts. There was a washed-out advertisement of some ancient patent medicine on the nearest wall. Superficially it was like ten thousand other drab city roofs. But he always saw it around dusk, either in the normal, smoky half-light, or tinged with red by the flat rays of a dirty sunset, or covered by ghostly windblown white sheets of rain-splash, or patched with blackish snow; and it seemed unusually bleak and suggestive, almost beautifully ugly, though in no sense picturesque; dreary but meaningful. Unconsciously it came to symbolize for Catesby Wran certain disagreeable aspects of the frustrated, frightened century in which he lived, the jangled century of hate and heavy industry and Fascist wars. The quick, daily glance into the half darkness became an integral part of his life. Oddly, he never saw it in the morning, for it was then his habit to sit on the other side of the car, his head buried in the paper.One evening toward winter he noticed what seemed to be a shapeless black sack lying on the third roof from the tracks. He did not think about it. It merely registered as an addition to the well-known scene and his memory stored away the impression for further reference. Next evening, however, he decided he had been mistaken in one detail. The object was a roof nearer than he had thought. Its color and texture, and the grimy stains around it, suggested that it was filled with coal dust, which was hardly reasonable. Then, too, the following evening it seemed to have been blown against a rusty ventilator by the wind, which could hardly have happened if it were at all heavy. (\"Smoke Ghost\")": "Fritz",

  "Seated in the middle of the floor with its back to me was the naked figure of a baby of, perhaps, two years, prattling wordlessly in its sing-song treble as it played with a pile of gleaming white objects arranged about it in a circle. One of these, a globular thing of peculiar configuration, it grasped in its right hand, and banged down noisily among the rest. Opposite, just discernible in the shadowy corner, sat the largest brindled cat I had ever seen, dreamily watching the play through half closed, flame-yellow eyes. I suppose it must have been many minutes that I stood there dumbfounded, staring at this incredible spectacle, before my dazed senses registered its full hideousness, and then a strangled gasp escaped me, for I saw that the toy in the child\u2019s hand was a tiny human skull and that all the other white things were the various bones of an infant skeleton!": "L.A.",

If you ask me now if I feel sorry for what I\u2019ve done, I\u2019d have to tell you plainly the answer is no. I\u2019d do it all again, given the opportunity. I\u2019d kill them all. Over, and over, and over. The court-appointed psychiatrist described me as having a \u201csevere antisocial personality disorder with excessive violent tendencies.\u201d But I\u2019m letting you know now I never stood out in a crowd.

  "I saw the massive stone altar first begin to glow like a ruby; then it was a heart of liquid gold like a solid single-crystal chrysoprase: the gold intensified into ice-cold emerald and passed into the dark sapphire of an arctic sky; this again withdrew into a violet so deep that the visual purple of the eye itself seemed absorbed in that depth, that abyss of color in which sight was being drowned. And as this intensification of vibrancy seemed to sweep across the visible spectrum up to those ranges where energy absorbs all mass and that which can pierce the most solid is itself fine beyond all substance, so it seemed with hearing. That abyss of sound which I had been thinking of as only depth, it, too, seemed to rise or, rather, I suppose I was carried up on some rising wave which explored the deep of the height.As the light drew toward the invisible, I experienced a sound so acute that I can only remember feeling to myself that this was the note emitted when the visible universe returns to the unmanifest\u2014this was the consummatum est of creation. I knew that an aperture was opening in the solid manifold. The things of sense were passing with the music of their own transmutation, out of sight. Veil after veil was evaporating under the blaze of the final Radiance. Suddenly I knew terror as never before. The only words which will go near to recreating in me some hint of that actual mode are those which feebly point toward the periphery of panic by saying that all things men dread are made actually friendly by this ultimate awfulness. Every human horror, every evil that the physical body may suffer, seemed, beside this that loomed before me, friendly, homely, safe. The rage of a leaping tiger would have been a warm embrace. The hell of a forest wrapped in a hurricane of fire, the subzero desolation of the antarctic blizzard, would have been only the familiar motions of a simple well-known world. Yes, even the worst, most cunning and cruel evil would only be the normal reassuring behavior of a well-understood, much-sympathized-with child.

  "Dread is the first and the strongest types of fear. It is that tension, that waiting that comes when you know there is something to fear but you have not yet identified what it is. The fear that comes when you first realize that your spouse should have been home an hour ago; when you realize that a window you are sure you closed is now open, the curtains billowing, and you're alone in the house.Terror only comes when you see the thing you're afraid of. The intruder is coming at you with a knife. The headlights coming toward you are clearly in your lane. The Klansmen have emerged from the bushes and one of them is holding a rope. This is when all the muscles of your body, except perhaps the sphincters, tauten and you stand rigid; or you scream; or you run. There is a frenzy to this moment, a climactic power-but it is the power of release, not the power of tension. And bad as it is, it is better than dread in this respect: Now, at lest, you know the face of the thing you fear. You know its borders, its dimensions. You know what to expect.Horror is the weakest of all. After the fearful thing has happened, you see its remainder, its relics. The grisly, hacked-up corpse. Your emotions range from nausea to pity for the victim. And even your pity is tinged with revulsion and disgust; ultimately you reject the scene and deny its humanity; with repetition, horror loses its ability to move you and, to some degree, dehumanizes the victim and therefore dehumanizes you. As the sonderkommandos in the death camps learned, after you move enough naked murdered corpses, it stops making you want to weep or puke. You just do it.

Leveled, smoothed as a highway is smoothed, its centuries choked beneath millions and millions of tons of hardened stone. The birth of a city... It had become the death of a world.": "Charles",

What was shocking was mother's response, that Dad had always called me the specially impossible child, mother had always focused on the impossible part, but now she could finally see why Dad had thought I was special as well.

Thus I secure my prey!'As He said this, darting his talons into the Monk's shaven crown, He sprang with him from the rock. The Caves and mountains rang with Ambrosio's shrieks. The Daemon continued to soar aloft, till reaching a dreadful height, He released the sufferer. Headlong fell the Monk through the airy waste; The sharp point of a rock received him; and He rolled from precipice to precipice, till bruised and mangled He rested on the river's banks. Life still existed in his miserable frame: He attempted in vain to raise himself; His broken and dislocated limbs refused to perform their office, nor was He able to quit the spot where He had first fallen. The Sun now rose above the horizon; Its scorching beams darted full upon the head of the expiring Sinner. Myriads of insects were called forth by the warmth; They drank the blood which trickled from Ambrosio's wounds; He had no power to drive them from him, and they fastened upon his sores, darted their stings into his body, covered him with their multitudes, and inflicted on him tortures the most exquisite and insupportable. The Eagles of the rock tore his flesh piecemeal, and dug out his eyeballs with their crooked beaks. A burning thirst tormented him; He heard the river's murmur as it rolled beside him, but strove in vain to drag himself towards the sound. Blind, maimed, helpless, and despairing, venting his rage in blasphemy and curses, execrating his existence, yet dreading the arrival of death destined to yield him up to greater torments, six miserable days did the Villain languish. On the Seventh a violent storm arose: The winds in fury rent up rocks and forests: The sky was now black with clouds, now sheeted with fire: The rain fell in torrents; It swelled the stream; The waves overflowed their banks; They reached the spot where Ambrosio lay, and when they abated carried with them into the river the Corse of the despairing Monk.": "Matthew",

  "When I first saw her she dropped her purse and was scrambling to find her glasses. I was two doors down on the right side of the hall, so I walked over and picked them up. I handed them to her and she slipped them on. Her hair was a mess and her face was pouring sweat. I was too and I was itching to get into my apartment. Living on the fourth of five floors was hot, but I had air conditioners in every room with big enough windows. The four machines made it like an ice box and I loved it. Some nights when it got cool enough outside, my windows would fog and I\u2019d see my breath. \tI turned and walked back to my small place and she called out.\t\u201cThank you! Most people don\u2019t notice me!\u201d\tI turned back to her and smiled, our eyes locked. Her glasses were thick, and they magnified her eyes several times. It was strange looking at them, but I kept my gaze on her for a few seconds as I turned back to my place. I looked her over. Her small breasts stood out against her stomach, which bulged slightly as if she was three or four months pregnant. I didn\u2019t think she was, because she wasn\u2019t straining as hard as I would think a pregnant woman would in this heat. She was attractive in a subtle way, not my usual type. She was tall, about six feet almost, and her long hair was curly, the bones in her hands and wrists stood out. She was skinnier than I ever liked.

A leather cosh dropped from his sleeve into his hand and he knew what to do with it all right.

The cords of his neck went taut and he looked away, as if embarrassed, eyes milky, a doomed petitioner gaping at Hell in all its fiery majesty.

They desperately want to believe that there is indeed something magical going on and they are primed to accept it whenever it occurs.

When we read in the books ascribed to Moses, Joshua, etc., that they (the Israelites) came by stealth upon whole nations of people, who, as the history itself shews, had given them no offence; that they put all those nations to the sword; that they spared neither age nor infancy; that they utterly destroyed men, women and children; that they left not a soul to breathe; expressions that are repeated over and over again in those books, and that too with exulting ferocity; are we sure these things are facts? are we sure that the Creator of man commissioned those things to be done? Are we sure that the books that tell us so were written by his authority?...The Bible tells us, that those assassinations were done by the express command of God. And to read the Bible without horror, we must undo every thing that is tender, sympathising, and benevolent in the heart of man.

The central argument of this chapter is that organised abuse has come to public attention primarily as a subject of ridicule within the highly partisan writings of journalists, academics and activists aligned with advocacy groups for people accused of sexual abuse.

  "Billy sipped the last of his coffee from the mug and shut down his laptop. 1,000 words wasn\u2019t great but it also wasn\u2019t as bad as no words at all. It hadn\u2019t exactly been a great couple of years and the royalties from his first few books were only going to hold out so much longer. Even if he didn\u2019t have anything else to worry about there was always Sara to consider. Sara with her big blue eyes so like her mother\u2019s. He sat for a moment longer thinking about his daughter and all they\u2019d been through since Wendy had passed. Then he picked up his mug with a long sigh and carried it to the kitchen to rinse it in the sink. When he came back into his little living room and the quiet of 1 AM he wasn\u2019t surprised to find her there over to the side of the bookshelf hovering close to the floor just beyond the couch. Wendy. Her eyes were cold and intense in death, angry and spiteful in a way he\u2019d never seen them when she was alive. What once had been beautiful was now a horror and a threat, one that he\u2019d known far too well in the years since she\u2019d died. He and Sara both. He stood where he was looking at her as she glared up at him. Part of her smaller vantage point was caused by kneeling next to the shelf but he knew from the many times she\u2019d walked or run through a room that death had also reduced her, made her no higher than 4 or 4 and half feet when she\u2019d been 6 in life. She was like a child trapped there on the cusp between youth and coming adulthood. Crushed and broken down into a husk, an entity with no more love for them than a snake. Familiar tears stung his eyes but he blinked them away letting his anger and frustration rise in place of his grief.\u201cFuck you! What right do you have to be here? Why won\u2019t you let Sara and I be? We loved you! We still love you!\u201dShe doesn\u2019t respond, she never does. It\u2019s as if she used up all of her words before she died and now all that\u2019s left is the pain and the anger of her death. The empty lack of true life in her eyes leaves him cold. He doesn\u2019t say anything else to her. It\u2019s all a waste and he knows it. She frightens him as much as she makes him angry. Spite lives in every corner of her body and he\u2019s reached his limit on how long he can see this perversion, this nightmare of what once meant so much to him.He walks past the bookshelf and through the doorway there. He and Sara\u2019s rooms are up above. With an effort he resists the urge to look back down the hall to see if she\u2019s followed. He refuses to treat his wife like a boogeyman no matter how much she has come to fit that mold. He can feel her eyes burning into him from somewhere back at the edge of the living room. The sensation leaves a cold trail of fear up his back as he walks the last four feet to the stairs and then up. He can hear her feet rush across the floor behind him and the rustle of fabric as she darts up the stairs after him. His pulse and his feet speed up as she grows closer but he\u2019s never as fast as she is. Soon she slips up the steps under his foot shoving him aside as she crawls on her hands and feet through his legs and up the last few stairs above. As she passes through his legs, her presence never more clear than when it\u2019s shoving right against him, he smells the clean and medicinal smells of the operating room and the cloying stench of blood. For a moment he\u2019s back in that room with her, listening to her grunt and keen as she works so hard at pushing Sara into the world and then he\u2019s back looking up at her as she slowly considers the landing and where to go from there. His voice is a whisper, one that pleads. \u201cWendy?": "Amanda",

There was a room visible now, in a reddish light. A pale man with black hair hovered over a woman dressed in white. She lay on a bed, looking disheveled and sweaty. Her brown-black hair clung to her wet forehead and shoulders. She was covered in blood. The man sat next to her, and held her close to him. He stroked her hair as her chest heaved desperately. \t\u201cI love you, my dearest Katerina,\u201d he said, cradling her in his strong arms. \u201cSoon, we\u2019ll be together forever.\u201d Everything faded to black once more, and the woman stopped breathing.

They enter the castle and go down the steps to the dungeon where people move like shadows in the glow of burning candles. There are carpets and funny pictures on the walls. Some of the people wear hoods and robes. Sometimes they chant in droning voices that make the little girl afraid. There are other children, some of them without any clothes on. There is an altar like the altar in nearby St Mildred\u2019s Church. The children take turns lying on that altar so the people, mostly men, but a few women, can kiss and lick their private parts.

  "William sees it all happen again. The pain is not in the event. The subjection to it and his powerless state each time is where his anguish lies. He is unable to influence the situation, despite his desire. He sees the nest outside his house. He sees the baby bird that fell. The mother bird cries frantically for her lost chick. William knows as he approaches the chick that if he touches it his scent will linger, and the mother will reject it. Circling around the fallen creature William hopes it will flee from him, back toward the tree from which it had fallen. His presence only intensifies the creature\u2019s fear. It speeds to his left, heading for the street. Again William tries to flank the bird, but it is too frightened to return to the nest. The chick\u2019s mother wails vainly. William walks into the street trying to herd the bird to safety. The stop light a block away has just turned green. The driver accelerates. William moves from the car\u2019s path and it runs over the bird. The momentum from its wake lifts the bird to the underside of the car, breaking its neck, but not killing it.

The bird\u2019s mother hears the chick\u2019s pain, but nothing can be done. She laments. A second speeder crushes the chick, leaving only a wet feathered spot in the street.

  "Quinn seemed to have become one of a jaded philosophical society, a group of arcane deviates. Their raison d'etre was a kind of mystical masochism, forcing initiates toward feats of occult daredevilry - \"glimpsing the inferno with eyes of ice\", to take from the notebook a phrase that was repeated often and seemed a sort of chant of power. As I suspected, hallucinogenic drugs were used by the sect, and there was no doubt that they believed themselves communing with strange metaphysical venues. Their chief aim, in true mystical fashion, was to transcend common reality in the search for higher states of being, but their stratagem was highly unorthodox, a strange detour along the usual path toward positive illumination. Instead, they maintained a kind of blasphemous fatalism, a doomed determinism which brought them face to face with realms of obscure horror. Perhaps it was this very obscurity that allowed them the excitement of their central purpose, which seemed to be a precarious flirting with personal apocalypse, the striving for horrific dominion over horror itself.(\"The Dreaming In Nortown\")": "Thomas",

  "The world of shadows and superstition that was Victorian England, so well depicted in this 1871 tale, was unique. While the foundations of so much of our present knowledge of subjects like medicine, public health, electricity, chemistry and agriculture, were being, if not laid, at least mapped out, people could still believe in the existence of devils and demons.

It was not until well into the twentieth century that ghost stories began to have a deeper significance and to become allegorical; in fact, to lose their charm. No mental effort is required to read 'The Weird Woman', no seeking for hidden meanings; there are no complexities of plot, no allegory on the state of the world. And so it should be.

  "As he sat up, he heard soft dripping sounds from the bathroom, little plips like water slipping over the edges of the tub and into the floor. The hairs on the back of his neck rose as he realized where he\u201fd last heard that sound. His muscles tight with strain from his earlier exertions, he stood and walked warily toward the half open bathroom door and the tub beyond it. Slipping quietly past the door, he saw that the curtain was drawn, and again the shadowed figure lay behind it. One long, slim, leg dangled from the end of the tub, beads of water gliding down its length and off the polished toes. At the other end he saw a mass of auburn curls, matted deep red near the porcelain of the tub. It was the dream and the vision again, more real now, too strong to deny. Shaking, he moved toward the curtain, gagging on the sickly smell of rust and roses, feeling the thin nylon glide between thumb and palm as he pulled it back to reveal his darkest nightmare and deepest regret. He could see the crimson water now, blood bubbles gliding over its surface and clinging to the legs dangling over the tub\u201fs edge. When he\u201fd pulled the curtain completely away from the tub and around to its opposite side, he saw her face. Her eyes were closed and he saw that her lids were bruised and purple against the translucent paleness of her face, drained completely dead white under the makeup she\u201fd brushed on before she\u201fd died. Staggering by the sight of her, he knelt by the tub and extended one shaking hand to touch her cheek. It all seemed as if he\u201fd walked into a horror film and once again he needed to prove to his mind that this wasn\u201ft real. His hand shook as he lifted it nearer to her flesh, waiting for the corpse, the supposedly dead and buried to move. He touched his quivering fingers to her face, feeling its claylike reality. The sensation caused an immediate shudder of revulsion and he fought not to vomit. Even as the moment came, the sight of her moving in the water startled him and he jumped away from the tub. It wasn\u201ft an obvious movement at first, only soft breaths moving in and out of her nostrils, but then her chest rose and fell with it and he quaked, feeling unstable where he knelt on the floor.Her eyes opened next and he felt the blood fall out of his face, wanting to scream but too afraid he would cause her to take some action, to reach out and touch him, proving well and forever that he was indeed insane. Scream and you might as well slit your own throat. He swallowed the scream like a rock and stared as her eyes moved slowly in their sockets, locking on him. Slowly, as if she\u201fd lost control of her muscles, she rose from the tub and looked down at him, smiling. Blood water slid down her bare body, over her neck, down her back and the smooth ridges of her breasts, to slip slowly down her thighs and down over her calves. A puddle spread on the floor, and as it extended toward him he struggled to his feet, skittering away from it. As he watched it spread, he shivered, weak as he started to cry frantic, horrified tears. Breaking down, he looked back up at her face and slipped to the floor once more, his knees incapable of sustaining his own weight. The smile grew wider as she strode to his shivering form, thrown on his side and struggling to rise. The blood water seeped into his clothes, making him sick, a drop of it trickling along the lobe of his ear and into it. And then she leaned down, holding those dim, stained curls of auburn out of her face and tucking them behind her ear. Her lips parted, blue beneath the strong crimson red of her lipstick, and she spoke into his ear with the chill breath of the dead. His eyes grew wide and horrified as she spoke, the hair on his neck rising, sending a maddening shiver of fear through him. \u201cI\u201fve returned, Raven.\u201d She whispered \u201cAnd I want what is mine.\u201d The last thing he saw before his mind, finally, thankfully, shut down was her face in front of his. They were pursed for a kiss.": "Amanda",
  "A spring sun was shining on the rue St. Honore, as I ran down the church steps. On one corner stood a barrow full of yellow jonquils, pale violets from the Riviera, dark Russian violets, and white Roman hyacinths in a golden cloud of mimosa. The street was full of Sunday pleasure-seekers. I swung my cane and laughed with the rest. Someone overtook and passed me. He never turned, but there was the same deadly malignity in his white profile that there had been in his eyes. I watched him as long as I could see him. His lithe back expressed the same menace; every step that carried him away from me seemed to bear him on some errand connected with my destruction.I was creeping along, my feet almost refusing to move. There began to dawn in me a sense of responsibility for something long forgotten. It began to seem as if I deserved that which he threatened: it reached a long way back - a long, long way back. It had lain dormant all these. years: it was there though, and presently it would rise and confront me. But I would try to escape; and I stumbled as best I could into the rue de Rivioli, across the Place de la Concorde and on to the Quai. I looked with sick eyes upon the sun, shining through the white foam of the fountain, pouring over the backs of the dusky bronze river-gods, on the far-away Arc, a structure of amethyst mist, on the countless vistas of grey stems and bare branches faintly green. Then I saw him again coming down one of the chestnut alleys of the Cours la Reine.(\"In The Court of the Dragon\")": "Robert",

It was what I sensed in Lovecraft\u2019s works and what I learned about his myth as the \u201crecluse of Providence\u201d that made me think, \u201cThat\u2019s for me!\u201d I already had a grim view of existence, so there was no problem there. I was and am agoraphobic, so being reclusive was a snap. The only challenge was whether or not I could actually write horror stories. So I studied fiction writing and wrote every day for years and years until I started to get my stories accepted by small press magazines. I\u2019m not comparing myself to Lovecraft as a person or as a writer, but the rough outline of his life gave me something to aspire to. I don\u2019t know what would have become of me if I hadn\u2019t discovered Lovecraft.": "Thomas",

And now from these globules themselves as from the shell of an egg, monstrous things burst out; the air grew filled with them; larvae so bloodless and so hideous that I can in no way describe them except to remind the reader of the swarming life which the solar microscope brings before his eyes in a drop of water - things transparent, supple, agile, chasing each other, devouring each other - forms like nought ever beheld by the naked eye. As the shapes were without symmetry, so their movements were without order. In their very vagrancies there was no sport; they came round me and round, thicker and faster and swifter, swarming over my head, crawling over my right arm, which was outstretched in involuntary command against all evil beings.

  "The minister paused in his narrative. At that moment there came a tremendous blast of wind which shook the windows of the manse, and burst open the hall door, and caused the candles to flicker and the fire to go roaring up the chimney. It is not too much to say that, what with the uncanny story, and the howling storm, we all felt that creeping sort of uneasiness which so often seems like the touch of something from another world - a hand stretched across the boundary-line of time and eternity, the coldness and mystery of which make the stoutest heart tremble.

  "Inevitably, his vision verged toward the fantastic; he published a scattering of stories - most included in this volume - which appeared to conform to that genre at least to the degree that the fuller part of his vision could be seen as \"mysteries.\" For Woolrich it all was fantastic; the clock in the tower, hand in the glove, out of control vehicle, errant gunshot which destroyed; whether destructive coincidence was masked in the \"naturalistic\" or the \"incredible\" was all pretty much the same to him. RENDEZVOUS IN BLACK, THE BRIDE WORE BLACK, NIGHTMARE are all great swollen dreams, turgid constructions of the night, obsession and grotesque outcome; to turn from these to the \"fantastic\" was not to turn at all. The work, as is usually the case with a major writer was perfectly formed, perfectly consistent, the vision leached into every area and pulled the book together. \"Jane Brown's Body\" is a suspense story.

  "He handed me something done up in paper. 'Your mask,' he said. 'Don't put it on until we get past the city-limits.' It was a frightening-looking thing when I did so. It was not a mask but a hood for the entire head, canvas and cardboard, chalk-white to simulate a skull, with deep black hollows for the eyes and grinning teeth for the mouth. The private highway, as we neared the house, was lined on both sides with parked cars. I counted fifteen of them as we bashed by; and there must have been as many more ahead, in the other direction. We drew up and he and I got out. I glanced in cautiously over my shoulder at the driver as we went by, to see if I could see his face, but he too had donned one of the death-masks.'Never do that,' the Messenger warned me in a low voice. 'Never try to penetrate any other member's disguise.' The house was as silent and lifeless as the last time - on the outside. Within it was a horrid, crawling charnel-house alive with skull-headed figures, their bodies encased in business-suits, tuxedos, and evening dresses. The lights were all dyed a ghastly green or ghostly blue, by means of colored tissue-paper sheathed around them. A group of masked musicians kept playing the Funeral March over and over, with brief pauses in between. A coffin stood in the center of the main living-room. I was drenched with sweat under my own mask and sick almost to death, even this early in the game.At last the Book-keeper, unmasked, appeared in their midst.Behind him came the Messenger. The dead-head guests all applauded enthusiastically and gathered around them in a ring.Those in other rooms came in. The musicians stopped the Death Match. The Book-keeper bowed, smiled graciously. 'Good evening, fellow corpses,' was his chill greeting. 'We are gathered together to witness the induction of our newest member.' There was an electric tension. 'Brother Bud!' His voice rang out like a clarion in the silence. 'Step forward.' (\"Graves For Living\")": "Cornell",
  "The car drives through, stops while the man closes and fastens the prickly gate behind it. The bell shuts off; the stillness is deafening by contrast. The car goes on until the outline of a house suddenly uptilts the searching headlight-beams, log-built, sprawling, resembling a hunting-lodge. But there's no friendliness to it. There is something ominous and forbidding about its look, so dark, so forgotten, so secretive-looking. The kind of a house that has a maw to swallow with - a one-way house, that you feel will never disgorge any living thing that enters it. Leprous in the moonlight festering on its roof. And the two round sworls of light played by the heads of the car against its side, intersecting, form a pear-shaped oval that resembles a gleaming skull. (\"Jane Brown's Body\")": "Cornell",
  "The glove comes off, flops loosely over, and there's suddenly horror beating into his brain, smashing, pounding, battering. He reels a little in his chair, has to hold onto the edge of the table with both hands, at the impact of it.A clawlike thing - two of the finger extremities already bare of flesh as far as the second joint; two more with only shriveled, bloodless, rotting remnants of it adhering, only the thumb intact, and that already unhealthy-looking, flabby. A dead hand - the hand of a skeleton - on a still-living body. A body he was dancing with only a few minutes ago.A rank odor, a smell of decay, of the grave and of the tomb, hovers about the two of them now.A woman points from the next table, screams. She's seen it, too. She hides her face, cowers against her companion's shoulder, shudders. Then he sees it too. His collar's suddenly too tight for him.Others see it, one by one.

  "At this point, a few words on this term 'horror' are perhaps called for. Some amateurs of this kind of literature engage in endless hairsplitting disputes, centered around this word and its close companion 'terror', as to which' stories may so be categorized and which may not, and whether or not descriptions such as weird or fantasy or macabre are preferable. The designation 'horror', with its connotations of revulsion, satisfies me no more than it does the purists but I believe that it is the only term which embraces all the stories in this collection and which succinctly suggests to the majority of readers what is in store for them. Horror then, in this instance, covers tales of the Supernatural and of physical terror, of ghosts and necromancy and of inhuman violence and all the dark corners and crevices of human belief and behavior that lie in between.

Everybody has evil in them, and when a man is alive... he will not abandon himself to many evil things.

  "Our house was an old Tudor mansion. My father was very particular in keeping the smallest peculiarities of his home unaltered. Thus the many peaks and gables, the numerous turrets, and the mullioned windows with their quaint lozenge panes set in lead, remained very nearly as they had been three centuries back. Over and above the quaint melancholy of our dwelling, with the deep woods of its park and the sullen waters of the mere, our neighborhood was thinly peopled and primitive, and the people round us were ignorant, and tenacious of ancient ideas and traditions. Thus it was a superstitious atmosphere that we children were reared in, and we heard, from our infancy, countless tales of horror, some mere fables doubtless, others legends of dark deeds of the olden time, exaggerated by credulity and the love of the marvelous.

  "I shook with cold and fear, without being able to answer. After a lapse of some moments, I was again called. I made an effort to speak, and then felt the bandage which wrapped me from head to foot. It was my shroud. At last, I managed feebly to articulate, 'Who calls?''Tis I' said a voice.'Who art thou?''I! I! I!' was the answer; and the voice grew weaker, as if it was lost in the distance; or as if it was but the icy rustle of the trees.A third time my name sounded on my ears; but now it seemed to run from tree to tree, as if it whistled in each dead branch; so that the entire cemetery repeated it with a dull sound. Then I heard a noise of wings, as if my name, pronounced in the silence, had suddenly awakened a troop of nightbirds. My hands, as if by some mysterious power, sought my face. In silence I undid the shroud which bound me, and tried to see. It seemed as if I had awakened from a long sleep. I was cold.I then recalled the dread fear which oppressed me, and the mournful images by which I was surrounded. The trees had no longer any leaves upon them, and seemed to stretch forth their bare branches like huge spectres! A single ray of moonlight which shone forth, showed me a long row of tombs, forming an horizon around me, and seeming like the steps which might lead to Heaven. All the vague voices of the night, which seemed to preside at my awakening, were full of terror. (\"The Dead Man's Story\")": "James",

By degrees my high spirits died out, and I felt the childish tremors, long latent, long forgotten, coming over me.

When we pass over into how a knight thinks, how a slave feels, how a heroine behaves, and how an evildoer can regret or deny wrongdoing, we never come back quite the same; sometimes we're inspired, sometimes saddened, but we are always enriched.

But we all try to understand a little. Most of us realize that too late. We look back and think: If only I'd tried to understand. Many failures in human relationships derive from this common failure.Watching the birds flock to discuss their travels among the brilliant leaves, listening to the slow turning of the earth upon her axis, meditating on Nature herself, never uncertain no matter how uncertain her manifestations may be, I think of the instinct that sends the birds from one locality to another, of the lengthening shadows as we face toward autumn, and of the marvelous system that encourages the leaf to fall and nurture the soil. In the single flame of October it begins the lullaby that will put the roots of grass and flowers to sleep. This system, in the four seasons of my little world, will cover the ground with silent snow, and at a later date will shout that spring is coming and awaken sleepers to new life.The sun in his glory, the moon in her phases, the stars in their courses, all these are part of the system; and Nature, turning the wheel of the seasons, understands what she must accomplish.Each in our own way, I suppose, we try to understand what we must accomplish.

  "[At the beginning of modern science], a light dawned on all those who study nature. They comprehended that reason has insight only into what it itself produces according to its own design; that it must take the lead with principles for its judgments according to constant laws and compel nature to answer its questions, rather than letting nature guide its movements by keeping reason, as it were, in leading-strings; for otherwise accidental observations, made according to no previously designed plan, can never connect up into a necessary law, which is yet what reason seeks and requires. Reason, in order to be taught by nature, must approach nature with its principles in one hand, according to which alone the agreement among appearances can count as laws, and, in the other hand, the experiments thought in accordance with these principles - yet in order to be instructed by nature not like a pupil, who has recited to him whatever the teacher wants to say, but like an appointed judge who compels witnesses to answer the questions he puts to them. Thus even physics owes the advantageous revolution in its way of thinking to the inspiration that what reason would not be able to know of itself and has to learn from nature, it has to seek in the latter (though not merely ascribe to it) in accordance with what reason itself puts into nature. This is how natural science was first brought to the secure course of a science after groping about for so many centuries.": "Immanuel",

We appear, nonetheless, not yet to have found a method for the mastery and organization of this material. When compared with our own abundance the past may seem very poor.

You cannot resist loving another person when you really understand him or her.From time to time, sit close to the one you love, hold his or her hand, and ask, 'Darling, do I understand you enough?

I don't want to make you suffer, and if I do so because of my ignorance, please tell me so that I can love you better, so that you can be happy.\" If you say this in a voice that communicates your real openness to understand, the other person may cry.That is a good sign, because it means the door of understanding is opening and everything will be possible again. Maybe a father does not have time or is not brave enough to ask his son such a question. Then the love between them will not be as full as it could be.

  "I remember when we found the first population of living Cerion agassizi in central Eleuthera. Our hypothesis of Cerion's general pattern required that two predictions be affirmed (or else we were in trouble): this population must disappear by hybridization with mottled shells toward bank-interior coasts and with ribby snails toward the bank-edge. We hiked west toward the bank-interior and easily found hybrids right on the verge of the airport road. We then moved east toward the bank-edge along a disused road with vegetation rising to five feet in the center between the tire paths. We should have found our hybrids but we did not. The Cerion agassizi simply stopped about two hundred yards north of our first ribby Cerion. Then we realized that a pond lay just to our east and that ribby forms, with their coastal preferences, might not favor the western side of the pond. We forded the pond and found a classic hybrid zone between Cerion agassizi and ribby Cerions. (Ribby Cerion had just managed to round the south end of the pond, but had not moved sufficiently north along the west side to establish contact with C. agassizi populations.) I wanted to shout for joy. Then I thought, \"But who can I tell; who cares?\" And I answered myself, \"I don't have to tell anyone.

Thus sf is creative and itinspires creativity, which mainstream fiction by-and-large does not do. We who read sf (I am speaking as a reader now, not a writer) read it because we love to experience this chain-reaction of ideas being set off in our minds by something we read, something with a new idea in it; hence the very best since fiction ultimately winds up being a collaboration between author and reader, in which both create and enjoy doing it: joy is the essential and final ingredient of science fiction, the joy of discovery of newness.": "Philip",

  "Sound waves, regardless of their frequency or intensity, can only be detected by the Mole Fly\u2019s acute sense of smell\u2014it is a little known fact that the Mole Fly\u2019s auditory receptors do not, in fact, have a corresponding center in the brain designated for the purposes of processing sensory stimuli and so, these stimuli, instead of being siphoned out as noise, bypass the filters to be translated, oddly enough, by the part of the brain that processes smell. Consequently, the Mole Fly\u2019s brain, in its inevitable confusion, understands sound as an aroma, rendering the boundary line between the auditory and olfactory sense indistinguishable.Sounds, thus, come in a variety of scents with an intensity proportional to its frequency. Sounds of shorter wavelength, for example, are particularly pungent. What results is a species of creature that cannot conceptualize the possibility that sound and smell are separate entities, despite its ability to discriminate between the exactitudes of pitch, timbre, tone, scent, and flavor to an alarming degree of precision. Yet, despite this ability to hyper-analyze, they lack the cognitive skill to laterally link successions of either sound or smell into a meaningful context, resulting in the equivalent of a data overflow.And this may be the most defining element of the Mole Fly\u2019s behavior: a blatant disregard for the context of perception, in favor of analyzing those remote and diminutive properties that distinguish one element from another. While sensory continuity seems logical to their visual perception, as things are subject to change from moment-to-moment, such is not the case with their olfactory sense, as delays in sensing new smells are granted a degree of normality by the brain. Thus, the Mole Fly\u2019s olfactory-auditory complex seems to be deprived of the sensory continuity otherwise afforded in the auditory senses of other species. And so, instead of sensing aromas and sounds continuously over a period of time\u2014for example, instead of sensing them 24-30 times per second, as would be the case with their visual perception\u2014they tend to process changes in sound and smell much more slowly, thereby preventing them from effectively plotting the variations thereof into an array or any kind of meaningful framework that would allow the information provided by their olfactory and auditory stimuli to be lasting in their usefulness.The Mole flies, themselves, being the structurally-obsessed and compulsive creatures that they are, in all their habitual collecting, organizing, and re-organizing of found objects into mammoth installations of optimal functional value, are remarkably easy to control, especially as they are given to a rather false and arbitrary sense of hierarchy, ascribing positions\u2014that are otherwise trivial, yet necessarily mundane if only to obscure their true purpose\u2014with an unfathomable amount of honor, to the logical extreme that the few chosen to serve in their most esteemed ranks are imbued with a kind of obligatory arrogance that begins in the pupal stages and extends indefinitely, as they are further nurtured well into adulthood by a society that infuses its heroes of middle management with an immeasurable sense of importance\u2014a kind of celebrity status recognized by the masses as a living embodiment of their ideals. And yet, despite this culture of celebrity worship and vicarious living, all whims and impulses fall subservient, dropping humbly to the knees\u2014yes, Mole Flies do, in fact, have knees!\u2014before the grace of the merciful Queen, who is, in actuality, just a puppet dictator installed by the Melic papacy, using an old recycled Damsel fly-fishing lure.

But, like dance, like music, a protest can be a religious ritual too, one that needn't be derisively looked down upon as magical thinking, but a spiritual act where the act itself is the goal. And that act may on some level be co-opted, but in the subjective world of the protestor it is a way, in itself, to be. Even in solipsism, the subject can be moral.

  "Yatima found verself gazing at a red-tinged cluster of pulsing organic parts, a translucent confusion of fluids and tissue. Sections divided, dissolved, reorganised. It looked like a flesher embryo \u2013 though not quite a realist portrait. The imaging technique kept changing, revealing different structures: Yatima saw hints of delicate limbs and organs caught in slices of transmitted dark; a stark silhouette of bones in an X-ray flash; the finely branched network of the nervous system bursting into view as a filigreed shadow, shrinking from myelin to lipids to a scatter of vesicled neurotransmitters against a radio-frequency MRI chirp. There were two bodies now. Twins? One was larger, though \u2013 sometimes much larger. The two kept changing places, twisting around each other, shrinking or growing in stroboscopic leaps while the wavelengths of the image stuttered across the spectrum.One flesher child was turning into a creature of glass, nerves and blood vessels vitrifying into optical fibres. A sudden, startling white-light image showed living, breathing Siamese twins, impossibly transected to expose raw pink and grey muscles working side by side with shape-memory alloys and piezoelectric actuators, flesher and gleisner anatomies interpenetrating. The scene spun and morphed into a lone robot child in a flesher's womb; spun again to show a luminous map of a citizen's mind embedded in the same woman's brain; zoomed out to place her, curled, in a cocoon of optical and electronic cables. Then a swarm of nanomachines burst through her skin, and everything scattered into a cloud of grey dust.Two flesher children walked side by side, hand in hand. Or father and son, gleisner and flesher, citizen and gleisner... Yatima gave up trying to pin them down, and let the impressions flow through ver. The figures strode calmly along a city's main street, while towers rose and crumbled around them, jungle and desert advanced and retreated.The artwork, unbidden, sent Yatima's viewpoint wheeling around the figures. Ve saw them exchanging glances, touches, kisses \u2013 and blows, awkwardly, their right arms fused at the wrists. Making peace and melting together.

  "True Cause. History is full of war, of death, of sacrifice\u2026of unimaginable brutality. All in the name of the Cause. The mighty Cause.It is not the idea of fighting for a cause that saddens me so. It is the ease with which people devote themselves to it. Men have flocked into the streets, marched, argued, fought, killed\u2026for causes they didn\u2019t even understand. They do it because they follow along, to be part of the group\u2026or because they don\u2019t want to be left out. Because they are told to, or because they crave to be part of something. They follow the Cause for many reasons, with great passion and staggering ignorance. Disturbingly rare among them, are people who fight because they truly understand the reasons for their struggle. Most are simply followers, nipping at the heels of their leaders, like dogs begging for scraps.Throughout history, men have fought for uncounted reasons. For land, for money, for hegemony over their neighbors. They have fought for religion, to avenge insults, to impose belief systems\u2026or to resist such being forced upon them. Wars have been waged to preserve or eliminate slavery, to escape the yoke of political masters\u2026or to impose such rule upon others. Men have fought against those they branded inferiors\u2026and struggled against those who called themselves their betters.The drum has beaten the call to war throughout history, rallying men and women to fight for the Cause\u2026to accept the inevitable pain and suffering of war. To sacrifice sons and daughters to the slaughter. To see cities burn and millions die in confusion, agony, and despair. All for the Cause.Since the dawn of recorded history, the flags have waved and the crowds have cheered. The soldiers have marched\u2026they have marched to fight for the Cause.What did most of them get back from those who called them to war? Famine, disease, shortages, despair. Burned cities and broken dreams. A flag-draped coffin in place of a live son or daughter. Words, endless, professionally-written platitudes, offered by the masters in justification of the slaughter.How often was the Cause truly just, worth the pain and death and horror of war? How many of those billions, who took to the streets for 5,000 years and cheered and sang and rallied for the Cause\u2026how many of them really understood? What percentage took the time to consider the facts, the situation\u2026to question what they were told and ultimately decide for themselves if the Cause was true and righteous? How many mindlessly believed the words of their masters, giving their all to a cause they didn\u2019t even comprehend? A Cause that wasn\u2019t worthy of their sacrifice?What if the Cause is false, corrupt\u2026a fraud created simply to urge men to fight? What if it serves nothing more than the base purposes of the leaders, buying them power with the blood of the people? What does the reasonable man, the just man, do if he discovers the Cause is false? Is there any retribution, any action, any violence unjustified in punishing those responsible?

  "Like the original concept, the stormrider had rectangular blades, sixteen of them radiating out from the hub, each one a flat lattice of struts twenty-five kilometers long, made from the toughest steelsilicon fibers the Commonwealth knew how to manufacture. Twenty-three kilometers of them were covered by an ultra-thin silvered foil, giving a total surface area of over one thousand eight hundred square kilometers for the solar wind to impact on. Even in an ordinary solar system environment that would have produced a considerable torque. In the Half Way system the stormrider was positioned at the Lagrange point between the red star and its neutron companion, right in the middle of the plasma current, where the ion density was orders of magnitude thicker than any normal solar wind. The power the stormrider produced when it was in the thick of the flow was enough to operate the wormhole generator. But it couldn\u2019t simply sit at the Lagrange point producing electricity continuously; that would have been too much like perpetual motion. As the waves of plasma pushed against it, they exerted an unremitting pressure on the blades that blew the stormrider away from the Lagrange point out toward the neutron star. So for five hours the two sets of blades would turn in opposite directions, generating electricity for the Port Evergreen wormhole that was delivered via a zero-width wormhole. The stormrider also stored some of the power, so that at the end of the five hours when it was out of alignment, it had enough of a reserve to fire its onboard thrusters, moving itself even farther out of the main plasma stream where the pressure was reduced. From there it chased a simple fifteen-hour loop back around through open space to the Lagrange point, where the cycle would begin again.": "Peter",

  "The ultimate irony in this vast struggle (available to audience members who want to think about it but easily ignored by those who accept the semi-happy ending ) is the irony in many time loop (or ontological paradox) stories: John Connor has created himself (though he has not gone as far as the character in Robert Heinlein\u2019s \u201cAll You Zombies\u201d who is both his own father and mother). Far worse, by saving his mother\u2019s life and ensuring the destruction of the Terminator, John Connor has created Skynet just as surely as Skynet has created John Connor by trying to kill him. Both Connor and Skynet exist in a time loop without outside causality. The Terminator\u2019s surviving arm makes Skynet possible, but it is never invented, only found and back-engineered. Kyle Reese comes across time for Sarah Connor because of a picture and because John Connor asks him to, but neither the picture nor John Connor would exist if Reese had not already gone back in time. The simplest way to save the world is to let the Terminator kill Sarah Connor. Then (in all probability), no one would find a piece of the advanced technology, and Skynet could not be built. But, Cameron\u2019s plot suggests, the \u201cperils to come that would result from our hubris and blind faith in technology\u201d may be inescapable, a time loop, a feedback loop, leading directly if not necessarily inevitably to destruction.\"Fighting the History Wars on the Big Screen: From the Terminator to Avatar\" from The Films of James Cameron": "Ace",

  "I\u2019ve never liked urban myths. I\u2019ve never liked pretending to believe in them; never understood why everyone else doesn\u2019t see straight through them. Why is it they\u2019ve always happened to a friend of a friend - someone you\u2019ve never met? Why does everyone smile and nod and pull the right faces, when they must know they\u2019re not true? Pointless. A waste of breath. So I sneered at the myths about Scaderstone Pit. It was just an old quarry \u2013 nothing more. I never believed in the rumours of discarded dynamite. It had decayed, they said. It exploded at the slightest touch, had even blown someone\u2019s hand off. I shrugged off the talk of the toxic waste. It was dumped in the dead of night, they said. The canisters rusting away, leaking deadly poisons that could blind you, burn your lungs. I laughed at the ghost stories. You could hear the moans, they said, of quarrymen buried alive and never found. You could see their nightwalking souls, searching for their poor crushed bodies.I didn\u2019t believe any of it \u2013 not one word. Now, after everything that\u2019s happened, I wonder whether I should\u2019ve listened to those stories. Maybe then, these things would\u2019ve happened to someone else, and I could\u2019ve smiled and said they were impossible.But this is not an urban myth.

  "Masochism is more widespread than we realize because it takes an attenuated form. The basic dynamism is as follows: a human being sees something bad which is coming as inevitable. There is no way he can halt the process; he is helpess. This sense of helplessness generates a need to gain some control over the impending pain -- any kind of control will do. This makes sense; the subjective feeling of helplessness is more painful than the impending misery. So the person seizes control over the situation in the only way open to him: he connives to bring on the impending misery; he hastens it. This activity on his part promotes the false impression that he enjoys pain. Not so. It is simply that he cannot any longer endure the helplessness or the supposed helplessness. But in the process of gaining control over the inevitable misery he becomes, automatically, anhedonic. Anhedonia sets in stealthily. Over the years it takes control of him. For example, he learns to defer gratification; this is a step in the dismal process of anhedonia. In learning to defer he gratification he experiences a sense of self-mastery; he has become stoic, disciplined; he does not give way to impulse. He has \"control\". Control over himself in terms of his impulses and control over the external situation. He is a controlled and controlling person. Pretty soon he has branched out and is controlling other people, as part of the situation. He becomes a manipulator. Of course, he is not conciousily aware of this; all he intends to do is lessen his own sense of impotence. But in his task of lessening this sense, he insidiously overpowers the freedom of others. Yet, he dervies no pleasure from this, no positive psychological gain; all his gains are essential negative.": "Philip",

Would the beetle be a fool to assume the human race put the can there to torment it \u2014 or an egomaniac to believe the can was manufactured only to mystify it? It would be best for the beetle to study the can in terms of the can's logic, to the limit of the beetle's ability. In that way, at least, the beetle can proceed intelligently.

  "The art of fiction has not changed much since prehistoric times. The formula for telling a powerful story has remained the same: create a strong character, a person of great strengths, capable of deep emotions and decisive action. Give him a weakness. Set him in conflict with another powerful character -- or perhaps with nature. Let his exterior conflict be the mirror of the protagonist's own interior conflict, the clash of his desires, his own strength against his own weakness. And there you have a story. Whether it's Abraham offering his only son to God, or Paris bringing ruin to Troy over a woman, or Hamlet and Claudius playing their deadly game, Faust seeking the world's knowledge and power -- the stories that stand out in the minds of the reader are those whose characters are unforgettable.To show other worlds, to describe possible future societies and the problems lurking ahead, is not enough. The writer of science fiction must show how these worlds and these futures affect human beings. And something much more important: he must show how human beings can and do literally create these future worlds. For our future is largely in our own hands. It doesn't come blindly rolling out of the heavens; it is the joint product of the actions of billions of human beings. This is a point that's easily forgotten in the rush of headlines and the hectic badgering of everyday life. But it's a point that science fiction makes constantly: the future belongs to us -- whatever it is. We make it, our actions shape tomorrow. We have the brains and guts to build paradise (or at least try). Tragedy is when we fail, and the greatest crime of all is when we fail even to try.Thus science fiction stands as a bridge between science and art, between the engineers of technology and the poets of humanity.": "Ben",

The Ringworld will be much sturdier than a Dyson sphere. We can spin it on its axis for gravity. A rotation speed of 770 m/s will give us a gravity of one Earth normal. We wouldn't even need to roof it over. Place walls one thousand miles high at each edge, facing the sun. Very little air will leak over the edges.Lord knows the thing is roomy enough.

If the Enshi doesn't eat your soul, I'll gladly eat your heart.\"Instead of replying, I stabbed her in the gut with a Khopesh. Her eyes bulged and she dropped me. I pulled the flaming sword out and slashed, but she caught my wrist before my blade could catch her skin, and she hissed, pulling her lips back viciously.\"Wrong move.\" Her flesh healed shut with only an ugly marbled scar left behind. She lashed her black power at me, striking me across the chest like a whip, and I staggered back. I shook off the blow and saw her lunge for me through the smoky remains of her attack.

  "The Peacemaker Colt has now been in production, without change in design, for a century. Buy one to-day and it would be indistinguishable from the one Wyatt Earp wore when he was the Marshal of Dodge City. It is the oldest hand-gun in the world, without question the most famous and, if efficiency in its designated task of maiming and killing be taken as criterion of its worth, then it is also probably the best hand-gun ever made. It is no light thing, it is true, to be wounded by some of the Peacemaker\u2019s more highly esteemed competitors, such as the Luger or Mauser: but the high-velocity, narrow-calibre, steel-cased shell from either of those just goes straight through you, leaving a small neat hole in its wake and spending the bulk of its energy on the distant landscape whereas the large and unjacketed soft-nosed lead bullet from the Colt mushrooms on impact, tearing and smashing bone and muscle and tissue as it goes and expending all its energy on you.In short when a Peacemaker\u2019s bullet hits you in, say, the leg, you don\u2019t curse, step into shelter, roll and light a cigarette one-handed then smartly shoot your assailant between the eyes. When a Peacemaker bullet hits your leg you fall to the ground unconscious, and if it hits the thigh-bone and you are lucky enough to survive the torn arteries and shock, then you will never walk again without crutches because a totally disintegrated femur leaves the surgeon with no option but to cut your leg off. And so I stood absolutely motionless, not breathing, for the Peacemaker Colt that had prompted this unpleasant train of thought was pointed directly at my right thigh.Another thing about the Peacemaker: because of the very heavy and varying trigger pressure required to operate the semi-automatic mechanism, it can be wildly inaccurate unless held in a strong and steady hand. There was no such hope here. The hand that held the Colt, the hand that lay so lightly yet purposefully on the radio-operator\u2019s table, was the steadiest hand I\u2019ve ever seen. It was literally motionless. I could see the hand very clearly. The light in the radio cabin was very dim, the rheostat of the angled table lamp had been turned down until only a faint pool of yellow fell on the scratched metal of the table, cutting the arm off at the cuff, but the hand was very clear. Rock-steady, the gun could have lain no quieter in the marbled hand of a statue. Beyond the pool of light I could half sense, half see the dark outline of a figure leaning back against the bulkhead, head slightly tilted to one side, the white gleam of unwinking eyes under the peak of a hat. My eyes went back to the hand. The angle of the Colt hadn\u2019t varied by a fraction of a degree. Unconsciously, almost, I braced my right leg to meet the impending shock. Defensively, this was a very good move, about as useful as holding up a sheet of newspaper in front of me. I wished to God that Colonel Sam Colt had gone in for inventing something else, something useful, like safety-pins.": "Alistair",
  "It is terribly important to realize that the leap of faith is not so much a leap of thought as of action.

  "\u2026There are times when something is asked of us, and we find we must do it.

  "America is a leap of the imagination. From its beginning, people had only a persistent idea of what a good country should be. The idea involved freedom, equality, justice, and the pursuit of happiness; nowadays most of us probably could not describe it a lot more clearly than that. The truth is, it always has been a bit of a guess. No one has ever known for sure whether a country based on such an idea is really possible, but again and again, we have leaped toward the idea and hoped. What SuAnne Big Crow demonstrated in the Lead high school gym is that making the leap is the whole point. The idea does not truly live unless it is expressed by an act; the country does not live unless we make the leap from our tribe or focus group or gated community or demographic, and land on the shaky platform of that idea of a good country which all kinds of different people share.This leap is made in public, and it's made for free. It's not a product or a service that anyone will pay you for. You do it for reasons unexplainable by economics--for ambition, out of conviction, for the heck of it, in playfulness, for love. It's done in public spaces, face-to-face, where anyone is free to go. It's not done on television, on the Internet, or over the telephone; our electronic systems can only tell us if the leap made elsewhere has succeeded or failed. The places you'll see it are high school gyms, city sidewalks, the subway, bus stations, public parks, parking lots, and wherever people gather during natural disasters. In those places and others like them, the leaps that continue to invent and knit the country continue to be made. When the leap fails, it looks like the L.A. riots, or Sherman's March through Georgia. When it succeeds, it looks like the New York City Bicentennial Celebration in July 1976 or the Civil Rights March on Washington in 1963. On that scale, whether it succeeds or fails, it's always something to see. The leap requires physical presence and physical risk. But the payoff--in terms of dreams realized, of understanding, of people getting along--can be so glorious as to make the risk seem minuscule.": "Ian",

At least he is clever enough not to expose the poverty of his general ideas; he never permits the conversation to move toward philosophical principles. Men of his type so dread all deliberation that they glory in the practice of the instantaneous decision. They think they are saving themselves from irresolution; in reality they are sparing themselves the contemplation of all the consequences of their acts. Moreover, in this way they can rejoice in the illusion of never having made a mistake; for act follows so swiftly on act that it is impossible to reconstruct the past and say that an alternative decision would have been better. They can pretend that every act was forced on them under emergency and that every decision was mothered by necessity": "Thornton",

Instead they must ask the wholly other, completely different question: 'What is the will of God?": "Dietrich"
