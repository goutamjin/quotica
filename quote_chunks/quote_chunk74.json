Over the years, she had received many different diagnoses, including schizophrenia, borderline personality disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder. Dissociative identity disorder was her current diagnosis.Cindy had been well until 3 years before admission, when she developed depression, \"voices,\" multiple somatic complaints, periods of amnesia, and wrist cutting. Her family and friends considered her a pathological liar because she would do or say things that she would later deny. Chronic depression and recurrent suicidal behavior led to frequent hospitalizations. Cindy had trials of antipsychotics, antidepressants, mood stabilizers, and anxiolytics, all without benefit. Her condition continued to worsen.Cindy was a petite, neatly groomed woman who cooperated well with the treatment team. She reported having nine distinct alters that ranged in age from 2 to 48 years; two were masculine. Cindy\u2019s main concern was her inability to control the switches among her alters, which made her feel out of control. She reported having been sexually abused by her father as a child and described visual hallucinations of him threatening her with a knife. We were unable to confirm the history of sexual abuse but thought it likely, based on what we knew of her chaotic early home life.Nursing staff observed several episodes in which Cindy switched to a troublesome alter. Her voice would change in inflection and tone, becoming childlike as ]oy, an 8-year-old alter, took control. Arrangements were made for individual psychotherapy and Cindy was discharged.At a follow-up 3 years later, Cindy still had many alters but was functioning better, had fewer switches, and lived independently.

  "Among DID individuals, the sharing of conscious awareness between alters exists in varying degrees. I have seen cases where there has appeared to be no amnestic barriers between individual alters, where the host and alters appeared to be fully cognizant of each other. On the other hand, I have seen cases where the host was absolutely unaware of any alters despite clear evidence of their presence. In those cases, while the host was not aware of the alters, there were alters with an awareness of the host as well as having some limited awareness of at least a few other alters. So, according to my experience, there is a spectrum of shared consciousness in DID patients. From a therapeutic point of view, while treatment of patients without amnestic barriers differs in some ways from treatment of those with such barriers, the fundamental goal of therapy is the same: to support the healing of the early childhood trauma that gave rise to the dissociation and its attendant alters.Good DID therapy involves promoting co\u00ad-consciousness. With co-\u00adconsciousness, it is possible to begin teaching the patient\u2019s system the value of cooperation among the alters. Enjoin them to emulate the spirit of a champion football team, with each member utilizing their full potential and working together to achieve a common goal.Returning to the patients that seemed to lack amnestic barriers, it is important to understand that such co-consciousness did not mean that the host and alters were well-\u00adcoordinated or living in harmony. If they were all in harmony, there would be no \u201cdis\u00adease.\u201d There would be little likelihood of a need or even desire for psychiatric intervention.

If psychiatric research has made so little progress in recent decades, it is in large part because everyone has been barking up the wrong tree. It is not a question of getting a bigger and better scanner, but of going right back to the drawing board.What\u2019s more, medical-type labels can be as harmful as they are hollow. By reducing rich, varied, and complex human experiences to nothing more than a mental disorder, they not only sideline and trivialize those experiences but also imply an underlying defect that then serves as a pseudo-explanation for the person\u2019s disturbed behaviour.

Media analyses of film and print have identified three: people with mental illness are homicidal maniacs who need to be feared; they have childlike perceptions of the world that should be marveled; or they are responsible for their illness because they have weak character (29-32). Results of two independent factor analyses of the survey responses of more than 2000 English and American citizens parallel these findings (19,33):- fear and exclusion: persons with severe mental illness should be feared and, therefore, be kept out of most communities;- authoritarianism: persons with severe mental illness are irresponsible, so life decisions should be made by others;- benevolence: persons with severe mental illness are childlike and need to be cared for.- Although stigmatizing attitudes are not limited to mental illness, the public seems to disapprove persons with psychiatric disabilities significantly more than persons with related conditions such as physical illness (34-36).": "Matthew",

The content of 47.9% (n = 333) of the articles was not strictly related to mental illness, but rather clinical or psychiatric terms were used metaphorically, and frequently in a pejorative sense. The remaining 52.1% (n = 362) consisted of news items related specifically to mental illness. Of these, news items linking mental illness to danger were the most common (178 texts, 49.2%), specifically those associating mental illness with violent crime (130 texts, 35.9%) or a danger to others (126 texts, 34.8%).

Second, we respond more intensely and much more quickly, than other people. And third, we don't 'come down' from our emotions for a long time. One the nerves have been touched, the sensations keep peaking. Shock waves of emotion that might pass through others in minutes keep cresting in us for hours, sometimes days.": "Kiera",

That means millions of Americans are totally batshit.but having perused the various tests available that they use to determine whether you're manic depressive. OCD, schizo-affective, schizophrenic, or whatever, I'm surprised the number is that low. So I have gone through a bunch of the available tests, and I've taken questions from each of them, and assembled my own psychological evaluation screening which I thought I'd share with you.So, here are some of the things that they ask to determine if you're mentally disordered1. In the last week, have you been feeling irritable?2. In the last week, have you gained a little weight?3. In the last week, have you felt like not talking to people?4. Do you no longer get as much pleasure doing certain things as you used to?5. In the last week, have you felt fatigued?6. Do you think about sex a lot?If you don't say yes to any of these questions either you're lying, or you don't speak English, or you're illiterate, in which case, I have the distinct impression that I may have lost you a few chapters ago.": "Carrie",

After failing to make an agrarian living raising beans for commercial trade (although his intent was always more allegorical than pecuniary), Thoreau ends Walden by replacing the pastoral idea where it originated: in literature.

He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer- excellent for drawing the veil from men's motives and actions. But for the trained observer to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results.

Persons who are inhibited in expressing feeling are not good conversationalists. Nothing is more boring than to listen to a person talk in a monotone without feeling. We enjoy a conversation when there is a communication of feeling. We have pleasure in expressing our feelings, and we respond pleasurably to another person's expression of feeling.

This is called \"mind-only,\" or \"essence of mind,\" or \"big mind,\" After we are separated by birth from this oneness, as the water falling from the waterfall is separated by the wind and rocks, then we have feeling. You have difficulty because you have feeling. You attach to the feeling you have without knowing just how this kind of feeling is created. When you do not realize that you are one with the river, or one with the universe, you have fear. Whether it is separated into drops or not, water is water. Our life and death are the same thing. When we realize this fact we have no fear of death anymore, and we have no actual difficulty in our life.": "Shunryu",

  "Mountains like these and travelers in the mountains and events that happen to them here are found not only in Zen literature but in the tales of every major religion. This allegory of a physical mountain for the spiritual one that stands between each soul and its goal is an easy and natural one to make. Like those in the valley behind us, most people stand in sight of the spiritual mountains all their lives and never enter them, being content to listen to others who have been there and thus avoid the hardships. Some travel into the mountains accompanied by experienced guides who know the best and least dangerous routes by which they arrive at their destination. Still others, inexperienced and untrusting, attempt to make their own routes. Few of these are successful, but occasionally some, by sheer will and luck and grace, do make it. Once there they become more aware than any of the others that there's no single or fixed number of routes. There are as many routes as there are individual souls.": "Robert",

  "There must be other leaps in life - as momentous as the \"mirror stage\" - that Lacan didn't mention. Some are universal; others, culturally particular. To understand that your parents are human (and not an element of the natural world), that they're separate from you, that they were children once, that they were born and came into the world, is another leap. It's as if you hadn't seen who they were earlier - just as, before you were ten months old, you didn't know it was you in the mirror. This happens when you're sixteen or seventeen. Not long after - maybe a year - you find out your parents will die. It's not as if you haven't encountered death already. But, before now, your precocious mind can't accommodate your parents' death except as an academic nicety - to be dismissed gently as too literary and sentimental. After that day, your parents' dying suddenly becomes simple. It grows clear that you're alone and always have been, though certain convergences start to look miraculous - for instance, between your father, mother, and yourself. Though your parents don't die immediately - what you've had is a realisation, not a premonition - you'll carry around this knowledge for their remaining decades or years. You won't think, looking at them, \"You're going to die\". It'll be an unspoken fact of existence. Nothing about them will surprise you anymore.": "Amit",

  "As I discussed in the previous chapter, attachment researchers have shown that our earliest caregivers don't only feed us, dress us, and comfort us when we are upset; they shape the way our rapidly growing brain perceives reality. Our interactions with our caregivers convey what is safe and what is dangerous: whom we can count on and who will let us down; what we need to do to get our needs met. This information is embodied in the warp and woof of our brain circuitry and forms the template of how we think of ourselves and the world around us. These inner maps are remarkably stable across time.This doesn\u2018t mean, however, that our maps can\u2018t be modified by experience. A deep love relationship, particularly during adolescence, when the brain once again goes through a period of exponential change, truly can transform us. So can the birth of a child, as our babies often teach us how to love. Adults who were abused or neglected as children can still learn the beauty of intimacy and mutual trust or have a deep spiritual experience that opens them to a larger universe. In contrast, previously uncontaminated childhood maps can become so distorted by an adult rape or assault that all roads are rerouted into terror or despair.

  "Reading Chip's college orientation materials, Alfred had been struck by the sentence New England winters can be very cold. The curtains he'd bought at Sears were of a plasticized brown-and-pink fabric with a backing of foam rubber. They were heavy and bulky and stiff. \"You'll appreciate these on a cold night,\" he told Chip. \"You'll be surprised how much they cut down drafts.\" But Chip's freshman roommate was a prep-school product named Roan McCorkle who would soon be leaving thumbprints, in what appeared to be Vaseline, on the fifth-grade photo of Denise. Roan laughed at the curtains and Chip laughed, too. He put them back in the box and stowed the box in the basement of the dorm and let it gather mold there for the next four years. He had nothing against the curtains personally. They were simply curtains and they wanted no more than what any curtains wanted - to hang well, to exclude light to the best of their ability, to be neither too small nor too large for the window that it was their task in life to cover; to be pulled this way in the evening and that way in the morning; to stir in the breezes that came before rain on a summer night; to be much used and little noticed. There were numberless hospitals and retirement homes and budget motels, not just in the Midwest but in the East as well, where these particularly brown rubber-backed curtains could have had a long and useful life. It wasn't their fault that they didn't belong in a dorm room. They'd betrayed no urge to rise above their station; their material and patterning contained not a hint of unseemly social ambition. They were what they were. If anything, when he finally dug them out of the eve of graduation, their virginal pinkish folds turned out to be rather less plasticized and homely and Sears-like than he remembered. They were nowhere near as shameful as he'd thought.": "Jonathan",

  "People, in my long experience, want to talk. They may believe they wish to keep secrets, and they may believe that they are capable of doing so.

What is it that comes from the telling?Some of it must be relief, of course.

  "In a later chapter, less argued over and less well-known, Teccam explains that there are two types of secrets. There are secrets of the mouth and secrets of the heart. Most secrets are secrets of the mouth. Gossip shared and small scandals whispered. These secrets long to be let loose upon the world. A secret of the mouth is like a stone in your boot. At first you\u2019re barely aware of it. Then it grows irritating, then intolerable. Secrets of the mouth grow larger the longer you keep them, swelling until they press against your lips. They fight to be let free. Secrets of the heart are different. They are private and painful, and we want nothing more than to hide them from the world. They do not swell and press against the mouth. They live in the heart, and the longer they are kept, the heavier they become.": "Patrick",

Lady Dedlock is always the same exhausted deity, surrounded by worshippers, and terribly liable to be bored to death, even while presiding at her own shrine. Mr. Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble confidences, so oddly but of place and yet so perfectly at home. They appear to take as little note of one another as any two people enclosed within the same walls could. But whether each evermore watches and suspects the other, evermore mistrustful of some great reservation; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the other, and never to be taken unawares; what each would give to know how much the other knows--all this is hidden, for the time, in their own hearts.": "Charles",

Goose bumps break across my skin, and I turn my face to meet his lips with mine. This kiss is gentler than our last, long and slow and restrained. It is a kiss of longing. A kiss of farewell. His hands tighten around my waist, pulling me against him. We drift in a slow circle, sending out ripples that make the floating flowers bob and dip.\u201cYou keep so many secrets,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cI could spend the rest of my life discovering you.\u201d He tucks my hair behind my ear, his eyes devouring my face.": "Jessica",

I willed and prayed and begged him to give me a sign that he was watching, that he was with me, so I would know. But he never did. Time moved on. And I stopped being afraid. Until right now, vulnerable and insecure and a little bit drunk. Lying in the sand and falling in crazy love with someone I just met. Matt is watching me. Observing. Possibly judging. And the worst part of it is, I don\u2019t want to wake up under his landslide of sad rocks anymore. I don\u2019t want to taste the marzipan frosting and the clove cigarettes. I don\u2019t want to think about the blue glass necklace or the books he read to me on his bed or the piles of college stuff or some random boy in the grocery store wearing his donated clothes.

Doors lead to things and I\u2019ve never met one I haven\u2019t wanted to open. All the same, if that door hadn\u2019t been so old and decorative, so decidedly closed, if a thread of light hadn\u2019t positioned itself with such wretched temptation across its middle, highlighting the keyhole and its intriguing key, perhaps I might have stood a chance; remained twiddling my thumbs until Percy came to collect me.

  "But the secrets of such a book are not perpetual. Once they are known, they become relegated to a lesser sphere, which is that of the knower. Having lost the prestige they once enjoyed, these former secrets now function as tools in the excavation of still deeper ones which, in turn, will suffer the same corrosive fate. And this is the fate of all the secrets of the universe. Eventually the seeker of a recondite knowledge may conclude\u2014either through insight or sheer exhaustion\u2014that this ruthless process is never-ending, that the mortification of one mystery after another has no terminus beyond that of the seeker's own extinction. And how many still remain susceptible to the search? How many pursue it to the end of their days with undying hope of some ultimate revelation? Better not to think in precise terms just how few the faithful are.": "Thomas",

  "For Sabina, living in truth, lying neither to ourselves not others, was possible only away from the public: the moment someone keeps an eye on what we do, we involuntarily make allowances for that eye, and nothing we do is truthful. Having a public, keeping a public in mind, means living in lies. Sabina despised literature in which people give away all kinds of intimate secrets about themselves and their friends. A man who loses his privacy loses everything, Sabina thought. And a man who gives it up on his own free will is a monster.

The setting in each house would have fit perfectly into a post-apocalyptic tale of nuclear holocausts. Shell-shocked expressions gazed into the nothingness.

  "When her voice cracked and tears started spilling down her cheeks, I panicked.

  "Studying him then, it was hard not to notice how handsome Luke was, a fact that that most of the girls hadn't missed either.

An honour they held rock, paper, scissor tournaments for. It was all very serious stuff.": "Violet",
  "Never underestimate the power of telling a teenage boy he's risking his chances of getting laid. Works almost every time.": "Violet",

Habit is a fixed tendency to react or respond in a certain way to a given stimulus; and the formation of habit always involves the two elements, the stimulus and the response or reaction. The indolent lad goes to school not in response to any stimulus in the school itself, but to the pressure of his father's will; when that stimulus is absent, the reaction as a matter of course does not occur.": "Edward",

Though it seemed as if heaven was on the other side of the hill, for some reason, the sunset was sad. At night, I would sit in the rocking chair by the fire with a cup of coffee and a book in my hand, a practice I had grown to love over the years. But what was once refreshing was now depressing.

  "Finding herself on the way to the village center again, she pulled over, intending to negotiate a three-point turn. The cottage was slightly out of the village, so she needed to get back onto the opposite side of the road and go back up the hill.

The rider tried to stop but couldn\u2019t do so in time, although he did manage to avoid hitting her car. As he turned his handlebars hard to the right, his tires lost grip on the wet road and he flew off, sliding some way before coming to a halt.Layla sat motionless in her car, paralyzed temporarily by the shock. At last she managed to galvanize herself into action and fumbled for the door handle, her shaking hands making it hard to get a grip. When the door finally opened, another dilemma hit. What if she couldn\u2019t stand? Her legs felt like jelly, surely they wouldn\u2019t support her. Forcing herself upward, she was relieved to discover they held firm. Once she was sure they would continue to do so, she bolted over to where the biker lay, placed one hand on his soaking leather-clad shoulder and said, \u201cAre you okay?\u201d\u201cNo, I\u2019m not bloody okay!\u201d he replied, a pair of bright blue eyes meeting hers as he lifted his visor. \u201cI\u2019m a bit bruised and battered as it goes.\u201dDespite his belligerent words, relief flooded through her: he wasn\u2019t dead!\u201cOh, I\u2019m so glad,\u201d she said, letting out a huge sigh.\u201cGlad?\u201d he said, sitting up now and brushing the mud and leaves off his left arm. \u201cCharming.\u201d\u201cOh, no, no,\u201d she stuttered, realizing what she\u2019d just said. \u201cI\u2019m not glad that I knocked you over. I\u2019m glad you\u2019re alive.\u201d\u201cOnly just, I think,\u201d he replied, needing a helping hand to stand up.\u201cCan I give you a lift somewhere, take you to the nearest hospital?\u201d\u201cThe nearest hospital? That would be in Bodmin, I think, about fifteen miles from here. I don\u2019t fancy driving fifteen miles with you behind the wheel.\u201dFeeling a little indignant now, Layla replied, \u201cI\u2019m actually a very good driver, thank you.

  "Miss Mapp moved towards the screen.\"What a delicious big screen,\" she said.\"Yes, but don't go behind it, Mapp,\" said Irene, \"or you'll see my model undressing.\"Miss Mapp retreated from it precipitately, as from a wasp's nest, and examined some of the studies on the wall, for it was more than probable from the unfinished picture on the easel that Adam lurked behind the delicious screen. Terrible though it all was, she was conscious of an unbridled curiosity to know who Adam was. It was dreadful to think that there could be any man in Tilling so depraved as to stand to be looked at with so little on...Irene strolled round the walls with her.\"Studies of Lucy,\" she said.\"I see, dear,\" said Miss Mapp. \"How clever! Legs and things! But when you have your bridge-party, won't you perhaps cover some of them up, or turn them to the wall? We should all be looking at your pictures instead of attending to our cards. And if you were thinking of asking the Padre, you know...\"They were approaching the corner of the room where the screen stood, when a movement there as if Adam had hit it with his elbow made Miss Mapp turn round. The screen fell flat on the ground and within a yard of her stood Mr. Hopkins, the proprietor of the fish-shop just up the street. Often and often had Miss Mapp had pleasant little conversations with him, with a view to bringing down the price of flounders. He had little bathing-drawers on...\"Hullo, Hopkins, are you ready,\" said Irene. \"You know Miss Mapp, don't you?\"Miss Mapp had not imagined that Time and Eternity combined could hold so embarrassing a moment. She did not know where to look, but wherever she looked, it should not be at Hopkins. But (wherever she looked) she could not be unaware that Hopkins raised his large bare arm and touched the place where his cap would have been, if he had had one.\"Good morning, Hopkins,\" she said. \"Well, Irene darling, I must be trotting, and leave you to your--\" she hardly knew what to call it--\"to your work.\"She tripped from the room, which seemed to be entirely full of unclothed limbs, and redder than one of Mr. Hopkins's boiled lobsters hurried down the street. She felt that she could never face him again, but would be obliged to go to the establishment in the High Street where Irene dealt, when it was fish she wanted from a fish-shop... Her head was in a whirl at the brazenness of mankind, especially womankind. How had Irene started the overtures that led to this? Had she just said to Hopkins one morning: \"Will you come to my studio and take off all your clothes?\" If Irene had not been such a wonderful mimic, she would certainly have felt it her duty to go straight to the Padre, and, pulling down her veil, confide to him the whole sad story.

  "Marcia was silent a moment. Then a sort of softer gleam came into her angry eye.\"Tell me some more about her,\" she said.Adele clapped her hands.\"Ah, that's splendid,\" she said. \"You're beginning to feel kinder. What we would do without our Lucia I can't imagine. I don't know what there would be to talk about.\"\"She's ridiculous!\" said Marcia relapsing a little.\"No, you mustn't feel that,\" said Adele. \"You mustn't laugh at her ever. You must just richly enjoy her.\"\"She's a snob!\" said Marcia, as if this was a tremendous discovery.\"So am I: so are you: so are we all,\" said Adele. \"We all run after distinguished people like--like Alf and Marcelle. The difference between you and Lucia is entirely in her favour, for you pretend you're not a snob, and she is perfectly frank and open about it. Besides, what is a duchess like you for except to give pleasure to snobs? That's your work in the world, darling; that's why you were sent here. Don't shirk it, or when you're old you will suffer agonies of remorse. And you're a snob too. You liked having seven--or was it seventy?--Royals at your dance.\"\"Well, tell me some more about Lucia,\" said Marcia, rather struck by this ingenious presentation of the case.\"Indeed I will: I long for your conversion to Luciaphilism. Now to-day there are going to be marvellous happenings...": "E.F.",
  "This was all splendid stuff for Luciaphils; it was amazing how at a first glance she recognised everybody. The gallery, too, was full of dears and darlings of a few weeks' standing, and she completed a little dinner-party for next Tuesday long before she had made the circuit. All the time she kept Stephen by her side, looked over his catalogue, put a hand on his arm to direct his attention to some picture, took a speck of alien material off his sleeve, and all the time the entranced Adele felt increasingly certain that she had plumbed the depth of the adorable situation. Her sole anxiety was as to whether Stephen would plumb it too. He might--though he didn't look like it--welcome these little tokens of intimacy as indicating something more, and when they were alone attempt to kiss her, and that would ruin the whole exquisite design. Luckily his demeanour was not that of a favoured swain; it was, on the other hand, more the demeanour of a swain who feared to be favoured, and if that shy thing took fright, the situation would be equally ruined. . . . To think that the most perfect piece of Luciaphilism was dependent on the just perceptions of Stephen! As the three made their slow progress, listening to Lucia's brilliant identifications, Adele willed Stephen to understand; she projected a perfect torrent of suggestion towards his mind. He must, he should understand. . . .Fervent desire, so every psychist affirms, is never barren. It conveys something of its yearning to the consciousness to which it is directed, and there began to break on the dull male mind what had been so obvious to the finer feminine sense of Adele. Once again, and in the blaze of publicity, Lucia was full of touches and tweaks, and the significance of them dawned, like some pale, austere sunrise, on his darkened senses. The situation was revealed, and he saw it was one with which he could easily deal. His gloomy apprehensions brightened, and he perceived that there would be no need, when he went to stay at Riseholme next, to lock his bedroom-door, a practice which was abhorrent to him, for fear of fire suddenly breaking out in the house. Last night he had had a miserable dream about what had happened when he failed to lock his door at The Hurst, but now he dismissed its haunting. These little intimacies of Lucia's were purely a public performance.\"Lucia, we must be off,\" he said loudly and confidently. \"Pepino will wonder where we are.": "E.F.",
  "Luck ever attends the bold and constructive thinker: the apple, for instance, fell from the tree precisely when Newton's mind was groping after the law of gravity, and as Diva stepped into her grocer's to begin her morning's shopping (for she had been occupied with roses ever since breakfast) the attendant was at the telephone at the back of the shop. He spoke in a lucid telephone-voice.\"We've only two of the big tins of corned beef,\" he said; and there was a pause, during which, to a psychic, Diva's ears might have seemed to grow as pointed with attention as a satyr's. But she could only hear little hollow quacks from the other end.\"Tongue as well. Very good. I'll send them up at once,\" he added, and came forward into the shop.\"Good morning,\" said Diva. Her voice was tremulous with anxiety and investigation. \"Got any big tins of corned beef? The ones that contain six pounds.\"\"Very sorry, ma'am. We've only got two, and they've just been ordered.\"\"A small pot of ginger then, please,\" said Diva recklessly. \"Will you send it round immediately?\"\"Yes, ma'am. The boy's just going out.\"That was luck. Diva hurried into the street, and was absorbed by the headlines of the news outside the stationer's.

  "Now Miss Mapp's social dictatorship among the ladies of Tilling had long been paramount, but every now and then signs of rebellious upheavals showed themselves. By virtue of her commanding personality these had never assumed really serious proportions, for Diva, who was generally the leader in these uprisings, had not the same moral massiveness. But now when Elizabeth was so exceedingly superior, the fumes of Bolshevism mounted swiftly to Diva's head. Moreover, the sight of this puzzling male impersonator, old, wrinkled, and moustached, had kindled to a greater heat her desire to know her and learn what it felt like to be Romeo on the music-hall stage and, after years of that delirious existence, to subside into a bath-chair and Suntrap and Tilling. What a wonderful life! . . . And behind all this there was a vague notion that Elizabeth had got her information in some clandestine manner and had muddled it. For all her clear-headedness and force Elizabeth did sometimes make a muddle and it would be sweeter than honey and the honeycomb to catch her out. So in a state of brooding resentment Diva went home to lunch and concentrated on how to get even with Elizabeth.": "E.F.",
  "Miss Mackintosh waved her arms wildly.\"Oh, please stop, and let me guess,\" she cried. \"I shall go crazy with joy if I'm right. It was an old Peerage, and so she found that Lady Deal was Helena Herman--\"\"Whom she had seen ten years ago at a music hall as a male impersonator,\" cried Diva.\"And didn't want to know her,\" interrupted Miss Mackintosh.\"Yes, that's it, but that is not all. I hope you won't mind, but it's too rich. She saw you this morning coming out of your house in your bath-chair, and was quite sure that you were that Lady Deal.\"The three ladies rocked with laughter. Sometimes one recovered, and sometimes two, but they were re-infected by the third, and so they went on, solo and chorus, and duet and chorus, till exhaustion set in.\"But there's still a mystery,\" said Diva at length, wiping her eyes. \"Why did the Peerage say that Lady Deal was Helena Herman?\"\"Oh, that's the last Lady Deal,\" said Miss Mackintosh. \"Helena Herman's Lord Deal died without children and Florence's Lord Deal, my Lady Deal, succeeded. Cousins.\"\"If that isn't a lesson for Elizabeth Mapp,\" said Diva. \"Better go to the expense of a new Peerage than make such a muddle. But what a long call we've made. We must go.\"\"Florence shall hear every word of it to-morrow night,\" said Miss Mackintosh. \"I promise not to tell her till then. We'll all tell her.\"\"Oh, that is kind of you,\" said Diva.\"It's only fair. And what about Miss Mapp being told?\"\"She'll find it out by degrees,\" said the ruthless Diva. \"It will hurt more in bits.\"\"Oh, but she mustn't be hurt,\" said Miss Mackintosh. \"She's too precious, I adore her.\"\"So do we,\" said Diva. \"But we like her to be found out occasionally. You will, too, when you know her.": "E.F.",
  "She was a gardener of the ruthless type, and went for any small green thing that incautiously showed a timid spike above the earth, suspecting it of being a weed. She had had a slight difference with the professional gardener who had hitherto worked for her on three afternoons during the week, and had told him that his services were no longer required. She meant to do her gardening herself this year, and was confident that a profusion of beautiful flowers and a plethora of delicious vegetables would be the result. At the end of her garden path was a barrow of rich manure, which she proposed, when she had finished the slaughter of the innocents, to dig into the depopulated beds. On the other side of her paling her neighbour Georgie Pillson was rolling his strip of lawn, on which during the summer he often played croquet on a small scale. Occasionally they shouted remarks to each other, but as they got more and more out of breath with their exertions the remarks got fewer. Mrs. Quantock's last question had been \"What do you do with slugs, Georgie?\" and Georgie had panted out, \"Pretend you don't see them.": "E.F.",
  "It was getting very clear then (and during this week Riseholme naturally thought of nothing else) that Lucia designed a longer residence in the garish metropolis than she had admitted. Since she chose to give no information on the subject, mere pride and scorn of vulgar curiosity forebade anyone to ask her, though of course it was quite proper (indeed a matter of duty) to probe the matter to the bottom by every other means in your power, and as these bits of evidence pieced themselves together, Riseholme began to take a very gloomy view of Lucia's real nature. On the whole it was felt that Mrs. Boucher, when she paused in her bath-chair as it was being wheeled round the green, nodding her head very emphatically, and bawling into Mrs. Antrobus's ear-trumpet, reflected public opinion.\"She's deserting Riseholme and all her friends,\" said Mrs. Boucher, \"that's what she's doing. She means to cut a dash in London, and lead London by the nose. There'll be fashionable parties, you'll see, there'll be paragraphs, and then when the season's over she'll come back and swagger about them. For my part I shall take no interest in them. Perhaps she'll bring down some of her smart friends for a Saturday till Monday. There'll be Dukes and Duchesses at The Hurst. That's what she's meaning to do, I tell you, and I don't care who hears it.\"That was lucky, as anyone within the radius of a quarter of a mile could have heard it.": "E.F.",
  "She's been, but she's coming back,\" he said. \"I expect her every minute. Ah! there she is.\"This was rather stupid of Stephen. He ought to have guessed that Lucia's second appearance was officially intended to be her first. He grasped that when she squeezed her way through the crowd and greeted him as if they had not met before that morning.\"And dearest Adele,\" she said. \"What a crush! Tell me quickly, where are the caricatures of Pepino and me? I'm dying to see them; and when I see them no doubt I shall wish I was dead.\"The light of Luciaphilism came into Adele's intelligent eyes...": "E.F.",
  "This little colloquy in Adele's box was really the foundation of the secret society of the Luciaphils, and the membership of the Luciaphils began swiftly to increase. Aggie Sandeman was scarcely eligible, for complete goodwill towards Lucia was a sine qua non of membership, and there was in her mind a certain asperity when she thought that it was she who had given Lucia her gambit, and that already she was beginning to be relegated to second circles in Lucia's scale of social precedence. It was true that she had been asked to dine to meet Marcelle Periscope, but the party to meet Alf and his flute was clearly the smarter of the two. Adele, however, and Tony Limpsfield were real members, so too, when she came up a few days later, was Olga. Marcia Whitby was another who greedily followed her career, and such as these, whenever they met, gave eager news to each other about it. There was, of course, another camp, consisting of those whom Lucia bombarded with pleasant invitations, but who (at present) firmly refused them. They professed not to know her and not to take the slightest interest in her, which showed, as Adele said, a deplorable narrowness of mind. Types and striking characters like Lucia, who pursued undaunted and indefatigable their aim in life, were rare, and when they occurred should be studied with reverent affection...Sometimes one of the old and original members of the Luciaphils discovered others, and if when Lucia's name was mentioned an eager and a kindly light shone in their eyes, and they said in a hushed whisper \"Did you hear who was there on Thursday?\" they thus disclosed themselves as Luciaphils...All this was gradual, but the movement went steadily on, keeping pace with her astonishing career, for the days were few on which some gratifying achievement was not recorded in the veracious columns of Hermione.": "E.F.",
  "On the doorstep Adele met Tony Limpsfield. She hurried him into her motor, and told the chauffeur not to drive on.\"News!\" she said. \"Lucia's going to have a lover.\"\"No!\" said Tony in the Riseholme manner\"But I tell you she is. He's with her now.\"\"They won't want me then,\" said Tony. \"And yet she asked me to come at half-past five.\"\"Nonsense, my dear. They will want you, both of them. . . . Oh Tony, don't you see? It's a stunt.\"Tony assumed the rapt expression of Luciaphils receiving intelligence.\"Tell me all about it,\" he said.\"I'm sure I'm right,\" said she. \"Her poppet came in just now, and she held his hand as women do, and made him draw his chair up to her, and said he scolded her. I'm not sure that he knows yet. But I saw that he guessed something was up. I wonder if he's clever enough to do it properly. . . . I wish she had chosen you, Tony, you'd have done it perfectly. They have got--don't you understand?--to have the appearance of being lovers, everyone must think they are lovers, while all the time there's nothing at all of any sort in it. It's a stunt: it's a play: it's a glory.\"\"But perhaps there is something in it,\" said Tony. \"I really think I had better not go in.\"\"Tony, trust me. Lucia has no more idea of keeping a real lover than of keeping a chimpanzee. She's as chaste as snow, a kiss would scorch her. Besides, she hasn't time. She asked Stephen there in order to show him to me, and to show him to you. It's the most wonderful plan; and it's wonderful of me to have understood it so quickly. You must go in: there's nothing private of any kind: indeed, she thirsts for publicity.\"Her confidence inspired confidence, and Tony was naturally consumed with curiosity. He got out, told Adele's chauffeur to drive on, and went upstairs. Stephen was no longer sitting in the chair next to Lucia, but on the sofa at the other side of the tea-table. This rather looked as if Adele was right: it was consistent anyhow with their being lovers in public, but certainly not lovers in private.\"Dear Lord Tony,\" said Lucia--this appellation was a halfway house between Lord Limpsfield and Tony, and she left out the \"Lord\" except to him--\"how nice of you to drop in. You have just missed Adele. Stephen, you know Lord Limpsfield?\"Lucia gave him his tea, and presently getting up, reseated herself negligently on the sofa beside Stephen. She was a shade too close at first, and edged slightly away.\"Wonderful play of Tchekov's the other day,\" she said. \"Such a strange, unhappy atmosphere. We came out, didn't we, Stephen, feeling as if we had been in some remote dream. I saw you there, Lord Tony, with Adele who had been lunching with me.\"Tony knew that: was not that the birthday of the Luciaphils?": "E.F.",
  "The news that she had gone of course now spread rapidly, and by lunch time Riseholme had made up its mind what to do, and that was hermetically to close its lips for ever on the subject of Lucia. You might think what you pleased, for it was a free country, but silence was best. But this counsel of perfection was not easy to practice next day when the evening paper came. There, for all the world to read were two quite long paragraphs, in \"Five o'clock Chit-Chat,\" over the renowned signature of Hermione, entirely about Lucia and 25 Brompton Square, and there for all the world to see was the reproduction of one of her most elegant photographs, in which she gazed dreamily outwards and a little upwards, with her fingers still pressed on the last chord of (probably) the Moonlight Sonata. . . . She had come up, so Hermione told countless readers, from her Elizabethan country seat at Riseholme (where she was a neighbour of Miss Olga Bracely) and was settling for the season in the beautiful little house in Brompton Square, which was the freehold property of her husband, and had just come to him on the death of his aunt. It was a veritable treasure house of exquisite furniture, with a charming music-room where Lucia had given Hermione a cup of tea from her marvellous Worcester tea service. . . . (At this point Daisy, whose hands were trembling with passion, exclaimed in a loud and injured voice, \"The very day she arrived!\") Mrs. Lucas (one of the Warwickshire Smythes by birth) was, as all the world knew, a most accomplished musician and Shakespearean scholar, and had made Riseholme a centre of culture and art. But nobody would suspect the blue stocking in the brilliant, beautiful and witty hostess whose presence would lend an added gaiety to the London season.Daisy was beginning to feel physically unwell. She hurried over the few remaining lines, and then ejaculating \"Witty! Beautiful!\" sent de Vere across to Georgie's with the paper, bidding him to return it, as she hadn't finished with it. But she thought he ought to know. . . . Georgie read it through, and with admirable self restraint, sent Foljambe back with it and a message of thanks--nothing more--to Mrs. Quantock for the loan of it. Daisy, by this time feeling better, memorised the whole of it.Life under the new conditions was not easy, for a mere glance at the paper might send any true Riseholmite into a paroxysm of chattering rage or a deep disgusted melancholy. The Times again recorded the fact that Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas had arrived at 25 Brompton Square, there was another terrible paragraph headed 'Dinner,' stating that Mrs. Sandeman entertained the following to dinner. There was an Ambassador, a Marquis, a Countess (dowager), two Viscounts with wives, a Baronet, a quantity of Honourables and Knights, and Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas. Every single person except Mr. and Mrs. Philip Lucas had a title. The list was too much for Mrs. Boucher, who, reading it at breakfast, suddenly exclaimed:\"I didn't think it of them. And it's a poor consolation to know that they must have gone in last.\"Then she hermetically sealed her lips again on this painful subject, and when she had finished her breakfast (her appetite had quite gone) she looked up every member of that degrading party in Colonel Boucher's \"Who's Who.": "E.F.",

  "Ode to Douglas AdamsIn the solar system we inhabit, we live on a small planet we all call Earth. Okay, when I say small, I mean it\u2019s small compared to say, oh, Jupiter. Earth is something like a dime compared to Jupiter\u2019s beach ball. On this Earth is a fairly large country we all call The United States of America. Of course, when I say fairly large, it\u2019s like the U.S. is a piece of broccoli next to China\u2019s really large cauliflower. Now that I think of it, that may not be a good comparison as it depends on the restaurant you go to. At the place I was at last night it would be a good comparison as the cauliflower was larger than the broccoli. Not that I\u2019d touch either. I had a hamburger with fries and somebody at the next table had those ghastly vegetables.From the Preface to \"Sex and the American Male.\" I was saddened by the passing of Douglas Adams and wrote the preface to sound a little like his \"Hitchhiker's...\" books and to honor him.

'Let me tell you, my dear Laura, that when I lay here weak and ill, unable to raise a hand in my own defence, I begged for a nurse, a hireling who would do her day-labour as a machine, and not worry a sick, ageing man.But even this was denied. Miss Grey, all kindness and sympathy and, I must say, Laura, an infernal bore, insisted on nursing me herself. Degrading enough in any case but the worst you have not heard. Could I ask my secretary to shave me? No.As a matter of fact, I did, but she wouldn't, or couldn't. Imagine me, Laura, becoming more like a pard day by day prickly and revolting to myself, mortified beyond words to be seen in this this condition, but helpless.''Why didn't you get the gardener to do it? Or use a safety razor?''My dear Laura,' said George Knox in a hurt voice, 'you do not seem to realise how weak I was, how very weak. For two days my temperature had been over a hundred, and when the fever had left me I lay powerless, as a new-born babe, and the woman triumphed over me.

Perhaps they welcomed death like a dear long-lost cousin, grown old but still known, coming to visit, relieving the loneliness, the failing of the senses, the fury of the half-blind looking into the mirror and not recognizing who is looking back, a dear friend, a dear reliever, a healer who would be with them for an eternity, the same eternity as the long ago, before birth.": "Samuel",

It leads to very destructive living and thinking, and it has a much worse effect on children than if you go out and live your own life. You\u2019re meant to adore your children at all times, and you\u2019re not meant to have a bad thought about them. That\u2019s facism, you know, and it\u2019s elevating the child at the expense of the mother. It\u2019s like your life is not valid except in fulfilling this child\u2019s needs. What about all your needs, your desires, your wants, your problems? They\u2019re going to come out anyway, so it\u2019s better they\u2019re acknowledged straight off. Having said that, I really do believe that children have to be protected. They have to be loved. Somewhere between the two, I think, something needs to be sorted out. The relationship between parent and child is so difficult and so complex. There\u2019s every emotion there. We mostly only acknowledge the good ones. If we were allowed to talk about the other ones, maybe it would alleviate them in some way": "Marina",

Motherhood then becomes a kind of priesthood.

  "Progress is hardly ever dramatic; in fact, it is usually very slow. As every parent and teacher knows, education is never a matter of ten-step plans or quick formulas, but of faithful commitment to the mundane challenges of daily life: getting up from the sofa to spend time with our children, loving them and disciplining them, becoming involved in their lives at school and, most important, making sure they have a wholesome family life to return to at home. Maybe that is why Jesus teaches us to ask for strength little by little, on a daily basis - \"Give us this day our daily bread\" - and why he stresses the significance of even the smallest, humblest beginnings: \"Wherever two of you agree about anything you ask for, it shall be done for you...

It is because of her child that she says this, He will magnify her ('For He that is mighty hath done to me great things'): He is her glory. Any woman could say it.

Not because my pregnancy upset me, or that my hormones were getting the better of me, but because I missed Joel, my baby\u2019s father. That the baby would grow up without a dad made me anxious. Then again, if he had survived, what irreparable damage would he have suffered and how would his pain translate to his child? Jesus, I was studying myself in the very mirror he\u2019d smashed the night he chose to take his own life.The bump had grown slowly in the last couple of months. With these limited resources, I didn\u2019t have the privilege of eating whatever I craved. Had that been the case, I was sure I would have been bigger by now. Still, I tried to eat as well and as often as I could and the size of my belly had proven that my attempts at proper nutrition were at least growing something in there.Nothing made me happier than feeling my baby move. It was a constant source of relief for me. In our present circumstances, with no vitamins and barely any meat products save the recent stash of jerky Earl had found in an abandoned trailer, my diet consisted of berries, lettuce, and canned beans for the most part.

Within a week, the girl will be able to tell at any minute of the day or night, precisely where every soul in the place is.

  "I remember at that time I went to the hairdresser's. I did this regularly, but I remember that visit for two particular reasons. The first was that next to me was a young mother with a little girl aged about three. The child, whose hair was about to be cut for the first time, screamed with terror and clung to her mother. The hairdresser stood by gravely, comb in hand: he recognised that this was a serious moment. The mother, blushing, tried to comfort the child who had suddenly plunged into despair; all around the shop women smiled in sympathy. What impressed me, and what I particularly remember, was the child's passionate attempt to re-enter her mother, the arms locked around the woman's neck, the terrified cries of unending love. So dangerous is it to be so close! I had tears in my eyes, witnessing that bond, seeing that closeness, of which only a sorrowful memory remained in my own life. One loses the capacity to grieve as a child grieves, or to rage as a child rages: hotly, despairingly, with tears of passion. One grows up, one becomes civilised, one learns one's manners, and consequently can no longer manage these two functions - sorrow and anger - adequately.": "Anita",

Hatred, love, all muddled up in that space inside a whisper, when the words don't matter anymore, when the baby's half asleep and you can carry it all the way there if you want, on nothing but the tone of your voice.

  "Isolation can be a particular problem for mothers at home with small children. Mothers become isolated from each other because we fear judgement. Other mothers can be our harshest critics. And we anticipate that criticism and don't ask each other for help.": "Kathleen",
  "Burnout can be defined as a loss of enthusiasm, energy, idealism, perspective, and purpose; it has been described as trying to run a marathon at full speed. It's often the mothers who care the most who are the most prone to burnout.": "Kathleen",
  "Our culture sends some amazingly contradictory messages about what an ideal mother is like. Mothers try to live up to these ideals without recognizing the contradictions or the improbability of the task. As mothers, you are often expected to have a fulfilling career, time for personal interests, a rewarding marriage, involvement in your communities, a thorough grasp of current events - and be able to provide baked goods at a moment's notice.": "Kathleen",
  "Being mom is one of my favorite things. It makes my day watching my kids grow and accomplish things in their lives.": "Amanda",

  "Maybe she\u2019d always wished to be beautiful and didn\u2019t quite dare to, because she could tell that people didn\u2019t say she was and more attention was given to other women, but she still had a frail hope that there\u2019d been a mistake and she was after all.": "Mona",
  "On first hearing that little voice \u2013 as fine and friable, I felt, as cotton thread, the impact on my soul was that of the highest magnitude of earthquake, those that occur every hundred years, say, or every thousand. The old shell I called myself cracked and was swallowed by a sudden crevasse, and just as suddenly was lost in the commotion.": "Antonella",
  "I was there for every moment. It made me a better woman and a better person. I can't say that all the damage done by my original family doesn't still haunt me": "it",
  "Delirious as it can be, sex is only one kind of intimacy, and yet has become the cultural catchment area for all kinds of needs because our understanding of intimacy is so poor. Brutal work schedules, related geographic isolation, and the concomitant fracturing of families has meant that there is little time for intimacy, and even less to teach the necessary skills. But intimacy, the axis of romance, is slow, based on the sharing of a life rather than show. In terms of intimacy, folding laundry together or sharing the feeding of a child can have more impact than the most extravagant bouquet.": "Antonella",
  "I think women should have choices and should be able to do what they like, and I think it's a great choice to stay at home and raise kids, just as it's a great choice to have a career. But I don't entirely approve of people who get advanced degrees and then decide to stay at home. I think if society gives you the gift of one of those educations and you take a spot in a very competitive institution, then you should do something with that education to help others... But I also don't approve of working parents who look down on stay-at-home mothers and think they smother their children. Working parents are every bit as capable of spoiling children as ones who don't work - maybe even more so when they indulge their kids out of guilt. The best think anyone can teach their children is the obligation we all have toward each other - and no one has a monopoly on teaching that.": "Will",
  "Women are like trees, growing slowly over time. So many rings creating layers of maturity as their branches spread and reach out to the sky. Motherhood prunes those branches. Sometimes it prunes them back hard and painfully. But if you let go and trust in the good of what it means to be a mother, if you can trust in the knowledge learned from the hard lessons, then faith and belief will carry you through. And in the end, you will grow fuller and more beautiful from the, sometimes harsh, pruning of motherhood.": "P.R.",
  "Suddenly, as they walked with their buckets, it was not the child in each face that she sought, but the Wonder that had raised itself on to its two feet, that had learnt to walk, to run, that had spoken, that had got in touch with life under her hand.": "Enid",
  "The children seemed to cast their Precursors like shadows about the house, sometimes tangibly, in the sound of a voice, sometimes by suggestion, because it was striking the hour for their return from a walk, sometimes mysteriously, because inside the shell of their mother's head the children were painted like angels on the roof of a chapel.": "Enid",

  "We watched each other evolve into parents, with all the fear, rage and confusion evolution can involve. Our eight-year-old is the incarnation of our union; we are forever fused by her blood.

I no longer saw the point in 'getting back to normal', that pantomime of pretending nothing had changed; I wanted to evolve from sexual posturing into a deeper consciousness, that of love.": "Antonella",

She measured out the nightly cup of rice, letting it soak in a pan on the counter. She peeled onions and potatoes and picked through lentils and prepared another night's dinner, then fed Bela. She was never able to understand why this relatively unchallenging set of chores felt so relentless. When she was finished, she did not understand why they had depleted her": "Jhumpa",
  "Young women are closer to the time when they were manipulative and childish and they don't let their babies manipulate them as much as older mothers do. These are only my conclusions from watching children in grocery stores. I love to watch them work on their mothers to get what they want, and, because I am always a child, I'm pulling for them to get the candy and to get it NOW. The other day I watched a little blond beauty pull her mother's face to her and lay her hands on her mother's cheeks and kiss her nose. Needless to say they opened the bag of cookies then and there.": "Ellen",

  "My handsome husband and I didn\u2019t make love for almost six months. I was enraptured, lost to my old life, and, in this obsession, disregarded author Ayelet Waldman \u2013 who famously wrote of her 'smug well-being' and 'always vital, even torrid' sex life in the wake of childbirth: I ignored my husband as a man. Instead, I revelled in him as a different thing altogether, far more seductive and important, and infinitely more resonant. My husband was no longer just a man: he was the father of my child.": "Antonella",
  "I'd wrestled against the inner voice of my mother, the voice of caution, of duty, of fear of the unknown, the voice that said the world was dangerous and safety was always the first measure and that often confused pleasure with danger, the mother who had, when I'd moved to the city, sent me clippings about young women who were raped and murdered there, who elaborated on obscure perils and injuries that had never happened to her all her life, and who feared mistakes even when the consequences were minor.

  "The Mommy Mystique tells us that we are the luckiest women in the world -- the freest, with the most choices, the broadest horizons, the best luck, and the most wealth. It says we have the knowledge and know-how to make \"informed decisions\" that will guarantee the successful course of our children's lives. It tells us that if we choose badly our children will fall prey to countless dangers -- from insecure attachment to drugs to kidnapping to a third-rate college. And if this happens, if our children stray from the path toward happiness and success, we will have no one but ourselves to blame. Because to point fingers out at society, to look beyond ourselves, is to shirk \"personal responsibility.\" To admit that we cannot do everything ourselves, that indeed we need help -- and help on a large, systematic scale -- is tantamount to admitting personal failure.": "Judith",
  "Confession: Having kids did not fix me. I was not somehow more whole, less botched-up, or more certain just because I had a kid... I was still me, with all my holes and problems and questions - only now I was also exhuasted and had a lot more laundry to do.": "Jerusalem",
  "I realized, listening to the silences that fell sometimes in my interview groups, that there are things that are sayable and unsayable about motherhood today. It is permissable, for example, to talk a lot about guilt, but not a lot about ambition. You can talk a lot about sex (or its lack) but not about the feelings that are keeping women from sleeping with their husbands. You can talk about society's lack of \"appreciation\" of mother's and the need for more social validation -- but not about policy that might actually make life better. You cannot really challenge the American culture of rugged individualism.": "Judith",

  "there is still a kind of unique loneliness to child rearing for women. We so often do it in isolation. Add to the fact that in our competitive, perfectionist culture, in which the price woman are required to pay for freedom still seems to be martyrdom, almost everyone lies about motherhood. Part of that lying is loyalty - I can't let on that my kid is the only one on the playground who can't read or play the piano - and part of it is self-protection, since we've made hyper-motherhood a measure of female success. The preferred answer to the question \"How are you?\" is always \"Fine,\" and the answer to the question \"How are the kids?\" is supposed to be \"Great!\" That's true even if the accurate answers would be \"terrible\" and \"a mess.\" I think it produces its own kind of desperation, especially for women, who yearn to be emotionally open.": "Anna",
  "I watched her with the crab as she ignored all my admonitions that the poor crab just needed to be set free if he was to have any chance of surviving. And God showed up there on that beach to teach me a lesson. Nothing survives when it's being smothered.

  "If an imaginative boy has a sufficiently rich mother who has intelligence, personal grace, dignity of character without harshness, and a cultivated sense of the best art of her time to enable her to make her house beautiful, she sets a standard for him against which very few women can struggle, besides effecting for him a disengagement of his affections, his sense of beauty, and his idealism from his specifically sexual impulses.": "George",
  "Only a woman can carry in her body an eternal being which bears the very image of God. Only she is the recipient of the miracle of life. Only a woman can conceive and nurture this life using her own flesh and blood, and then deliver a living soul into the world. God has bestowed upon her alone a genuine miracle \u2014 the creation of life, and the fusing of an eternal soul with mortal flesh. This fact alone establishes the glory of motherhood.Despite the most creative plans of humanist scientists and lawmakers to redefine the sexes, no man will ever conceive and give birth to a child. The fruitful womb is a holy gift given by God to women alone. This is one reason why the office of wife and mother is the highest calling to which a woman can aspire.This is the reason why nations that fear the Lord esteem and protect mothers. They glory in the distinctions between men and women, and attempt to build cultures in which motherhood is honored and protected.": "Douglas",

  "That\u2019s the funny thing,\u201d she said. \u201cMen always want to die for something. For someone. I can see the appeal. You do it once and it\u2019s done. No more worrying, not knowing, about tomorrow and tomorrow and tomorrow. I know you all think it sounds brave, but I\u2019ll tell you something even braver. To struggle and fight for the ones you love today. And then do it all over again the next day. Every day. For your whole life. It\u2019s not as romantic, I admit.

The mother expects to take her place, and to repair by her cruelty the results of her own neglect.

You've heard of Kabuki\u2014with its wildly theatrical actors, its gorgeous costumes, and spectacular scale. The kuroko are assistants who help the actors move through their elaborate dramas. Meant to provide unobtrusive assistance with props and costumes, kuroko try to remain in the wings. They huddle in half-kneeling posture, wearing black bags over their heads and bodies\u2014the better to recede into both actors' and audience's preconscious mind.

I think people have children for all manner of reasons- sometimes out of pure desire to nurture and witness life, sometimes out of an absence of choice, sometimes without thinking about it in any particular way.

But if I watch her life unfold carefully enough, perhaps I will see clear signposts pointing to who or what she will become.Because when I look backwards, ransacking my own past for clues with the clarity that only hindsight can bring, several defining moments do stand out.

  "He had written her reams and reams of letters, as well as a poem that she kept folded in a locket around her neck. Her letters were full of love and anticipation, matching his for enthusiasm and tenderness. He was the luckiest man in the world.": "Melissa",
  "silly man. I know the man I am marrying is destined for great things, as the many remarkable things he has done thus far have brought himto such a high oint already. Mark my words, Alex. You are a man whose future lies before him for all to marvel at one day. And you, Colonel Hamilton, are mine, and I am yours always.": "Melissa",
  "Altogether, the first glimpse of his bride-which should have come as no surprise to Alex, standing there looking so lean and handsome himself-nearly brought him to his knees.": "Melissa",

  "Eliza had never seen Alex quite so happy and relaxed. She shook her head and laughed at the incongruity of it all: Imagine General Washington's famous aide-de-camp taking the time to stop and admire the birds.\"One day, Alex, when you tire of being a soldier, we will spend all of our days just like this, watching birds and taking in the sun, surrounded by children of our own. You'd like that, wouldn't you, my love?\"\"Eliza, you and the Pastures have already taken a perfectly fine soldier and turned him into a lovesick pup.

  "The scene unfolded before him as though he were a ghost.\tHis mother stood on the raised stump, her body tied to the tall stake behind her. A pile of wood encircled her feet. Only a small crowd had gathered in the courtyard, despite his father\u2019s commands that all should attend. Alasdair sobbed at her feet, calling out to her. The young Alasdair climbed on the pile and clutched her flowing gown. She had been dressed in her finest, not stripped down to her chemise like the handmaid who stood tied to a post beside her. His father had always liked a display. Alasdair\u2019s hands reached and passed over his mother\u2019s large pregnant belly. With that, she sobbed, too. \u201cOh, Ali, be good for Momma. I\u2019ll see you in the pearly white heaven that God has promised us. Be steadfast, son. Trust your heart.\u201d\t\u201cLight it,\u201d his father ordered.": "Jean",

  "He grinned: he\u2019d turned in time to witness her delicate white shoulders dip below the water\u2019s surface. Thankfully, she quickly completed her morning\u2019s ablutions and made a shooing motion with her hands. Back turned again, he waited for her to dress, all the while telling his privy counselor to cease its repeated suggestions.": "Angela",
  "You will be the death of me, woman.": "Angela",
  "Here, sleep with your back against me. I shall protect you better this way.\u201d She nodded, shuffled closer, and leaned back against him. Her unique womanly scent washed over him, and he fortified his resolve, though having her so close on a bed of furs fired his blood. She dragged her fur up, and he draped his extra across, tucking it in around her shoulders and arms. \u201cI do not fancy having one of them lying next to you. Besides, I wish not for your pinkie to wander.": "Angela",
  "Alexandra took the rose and lifted it to her face. The fragrance was intoxicating and the soft petals tickled her lips, as they must have done Benedict\u2019s. It was as if he had kissed her. A shiver of delight caressed her body and she felt the warmth of a blush on her throat and cheeks.": "Ellen",
  "Together they looked skyward. The moonbow was shattering--mere bits of color in the blackness, a sort of bridge between heaven and earth--reminding her that even on the darkest nights there was a glimmer of home, of promise, however hazy.": "Laura",

  "A hot romp is timeless ...": "Sofie",
  "His brothers accepted his fluid nature as something Darian simply was. He had been so all his life; suspended between male and female, one rising, the other ebbing without pattern or reason. The Queen, daughterless and doting, had gladly let her youngest sonwear gowns, bows, and curls far longer than appropriate, until his father had intervened with violent persuasion. At court, he now moved as a man. In private, he never stopped wearing gowns or ribbons when the softer she inside him waxed like the full moon. He allowed her complete rein. In truth, he no longer knew where he ended and she began. They were the same.": "E.M.",
  "The pulse visible in the pale column of her neck vibrated faster, her intoxicating scent washed over him, and he was dizzy with lust. Even through his mail and gambeson, he could feel her womanly curves crushed against his hard chest. He uncurled his fingers from her throat and ran the tough leather of his palm\u2019s mitten along her neck and to the enticing curve of her shoulder. He nudged her mantle an inch, exposing skin. He cursed that his hand was covered in mail. How long had he wanted to taste, to touch her precious skin? Unable to resist, he bent and, with his tongue, touched, tasted the heat of the skin on her collarbone. Oh, Christ, she was lovely. She shivered, and satisfaction roared through him.": "Angela",
  "His heat, his erotic pull\u2014she could feel it. A weird, pulsing, virtual pull tugging at her skin, her nerve endings. Made her want to\u2026touch. Made her want. The more she resisted the urge, the stronger it became. It would be a relief, really. To just\u2026touch. One little touch. Just one.": "Angela",
  "Her pinkie took matters into its own, er, pinkie, and moved oh-so-slightly, grazing his skin. His pinkie, judging by the shape and texture. Blood rushed and pounded through her veins, flushing her skin. This could not, in any way, be explained as an accidental touch. But he could feign sleep if he wasn\u2019t interested. Did she want him to do that? What was she doing? She commanded her pinkie to drop, and thankfully, it obeyed. A jolt shot through her as his finger made a query, and the need clarified. The need represented her desire for some measure of control. Control over her general situation. Control over her attraction. She answered with a gentle finger stroke along his calloused, warm skin. A sharp breath pierced the dark air.": "Angela",
  "He leaned his head against the rock. Christ, when was the last time he\u2019d seen the humor in life? And now, of all places, in an enemy camp, with a strange woman who made him burn. Burn with desire. Burn with need. A desire and need not only for her and her body, but for something he couldn\u2019t quite name.": "Angela",
  "She flapped her hands, anxious energy coursing through her. \u201cHow can you be so calm?\u201d He got to his feet, unfolding with an easy grace. He held out a hand, his dark eyes focused solemnly on hers. \u201cCome with me.\u201d \u201cFor what?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s part of the lesson.\u201d Was it her imagination, or did a twinkle of humor stir in those eyes? \u201cCenter yourself, and grab onto the here and now.\u201d That made no sense\u2014what was he now, Sir Medieval Zen Master? But she slipped her hand into his strong, calloused one. He hauled her up until she bumped into his chest. With a finger under her chin, he tilted her face until she looked in his eyes. \u201cListen to the world around you. Hear the birds? Hear the small animals scurrying? You are in this moment, this moment only, and sometimes that\u2019s all you can do, all you can be.\u201d His finger pulled away, brushing against her skin, and he tapped her nose, stepping away.": "Angela",
  "She led them to their pallets, again encircled by other pallets. She sat down, sighing at her aching muscles, and caught his gaze. \u201cYou may, er, wrap your arms around me if that will make you feel I am safer.\u201d He chuckled--a hoarse chuckle, rusty, but a chuckle nonetheless. She\u2019d take it. \u201cMay I indeed?\u201d He lay beside her and pulled her back against him, settling her head on his arm, bunching the other hide up to use as a pillow. \u201cIf I must.\u201d His warm sigh tickled across her neck. \u201cAfter all, I must ensure that pinkie does not wander.\u201d Would Robert never let her forget that?": "Angela",
  "He clutched her to him with a desperate strength that almost hurt. \"I will love you for your light, if you can love me through the dark times. And that love will be like the clear night sky when the moon is full. Not like the sun....but beautiful and bright enough to find our way.": "Kerrigan",
  "Though we are not together in body, know that I will always be with you in spirit. I will be in the whistling wind and in your dreams. Think of me in the joy of watching snow fall and know that I am thinking of you always.": "Amy",

  "He hadn\u2019t landed on the battlefield to save Christina, at least not entirely. He\u2019d landed there because it was meant to be \u2013 because his destiny lay with a bonny woman who would capture his heart and show him honor and respect on a uniquely deep level that had been lost in the twenty-first century.": "Amy",
  "When their lips finally met, all the pent up emotion within Christina\u2019s breast surged, funneling into a whirlwind of heat. Pushing away all thoughts, she allowed herself only to feel. Lachlan could be so physical, so powerful, so brutal, but when he wrapped his arms around her, Christina felt invincible. Be it true or nay, she felt loved, and cherished, and valued. Reaching up, she slid her fingers through his locks. Soft waves of thick tresses contrasted with hardened male\u2026.\tAs his kiss eased, he cupped her cheek in the palm of his hand. \u201cI wish I could hold you in my arms forever.": "Amy",
  "He had years of experience and training. She'd unraveled them in a week, and he was left at loose ends. This distraction, this madness of desire and yearning- it was everything a man in his position needed to avoid. On second thought, perhaps his senses hadn't been muddled. After all, they had been meticulously attuned to detect the slightest hint of peril.This woman- this beautiful, unbiddable, all-too-perceptive woman- was his personal embodiment of danger. She could ruin him. Destroy everything he'd worked to become.And she would do it all with a smile.": "Tessa",
  "My mum always taught that the truth will set you free.\u201d\t\u201cDid she now?\u201d\t\u201cMm hmm,\u201d Lachlan brushed the pad of his pointer finger over her cheek\u2019s silken skin. \u201cBut she kept one truth hidden from me until very recently.\u201d\t\u201cWhat was that?\u201d\tHe gulped. \u201cYou know the truth thing on the medallion?\t\u201cAye.\u201d\t\u201cWell, if that\u2019s my rallying cry, then it will mean the world to me if you trust that I\u2019m not lying.\u201d\tShe let the disk drop back to his chest. \u201cYe can tell me anything, I\u2019d reckon.\u201d\tHe needed to tell her the truth. \u201cMy father is \u2013 was William Wallace.": "Amy",
  "He took a step back to distance himself from her wicked, mind-consuming scent. In the future if he wanted to bamboozle an opponent in the karate ring, all he had to do was splash on some eau de Christina.": "Amy",
  "Howie brought her hand to his lips. \u201cYou stepped in front of me,\u201d he said in wonder. \u201cI didn\u2019t need you to. I can handle Prudence Morgan.\u201d \u201cBut you didn\u2019t.\u201d She tapped his chest. \u201cYou stayed quiet for the longest time before responding.\u201d \u201cQuiet is how I handle difficult people\u2026.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t handle me that way.\u201d Her voice came out sounding breathless. Howie slipped his arms around her. \u201cIf it were up to me, this is how I\u2019d handle you.\u201d Butterflies danced in her stomach. Not a fearful battering of wings, but a sparkling mating flight, making her heart soar into her throat. \u201cWhy isn\u2019t it up to you?": "Debra",
  "Even through her coat, he could feel the curve of her arm, making him aware of their differences. Man and woman. Hard and soft.": "Debra",
  "Don\u2019t be sorry, Darlin\u2019\u201d, he said in his best cowboy drawl, \u201cfor I\u2019m certainly not. It\u2019s not every day a man like me gets to assist such a pretty lady. Any time you need help in or out of a wagon, you just give me a holler\u201d he said in a teasing tone, \u201cI\u2019ll be right there, hoping you\u2019ll fall in my arms again.": "Debra",
  "Howie rose and smiled down at her. \u201cI just eat what\u2019s put before me without being picky. I know everything you make will make my tastebuds bless the day you set foot in Morgan\u2019s Crossing\u201d he drawled, waiting to see the adorable look of confusion that crossed her face when he flirted.Bertha lowered her gaze and looked up at him through her eyelashes.\u201cOnly your tastebuds?": "Debra",
  "I particularly want you to meet Miss Bucholtz.\u201d The very idea made him uneasy. \u201cWhy is that,Ma\u2019am?\u201d he bluntly asked. Mrs. Morgan hesitated. \u201cKeep this under your hat, mind you.\u201d \u201cYes, Ma\u2019am.\u201d  She let out a tired sigh. \u201cI\u2019ve brought Miss Bucholtz to replace Mr. Gabellini.\u201d Howie pictured a dried up old spinster with the same commanding presence as Mrs. Morgan, a real battle-axe. \u201cFireworks are coming. Are you sure a woman is the right, uh, person for the job?\u201d \u201cBertha Bucholz is one of the best cooks I know. I guarantee by this time next month, you men will all be sporting five extra pounds.": "Debra",
  "Cole stilled when his feral eyes found her, roaming every inch as though searching for a wound. The doorway framed him like a portal to purgatory, and he stood like an avenging archangel come to wreak a wrath no less than biblical. The swells of his powerful chest heaved against the white of his shirtsleeves now blotched and stained with blood. The blade on his prosthesis was extended past the motionless metal fingers, and blood dripped from it into a thick crimson puddle on the marble floor.": "Kerrigan",
  "A woman\u2019s lust is addictive ,\" he murmured, marveling at the wetness coating his fingers as he stroked her. She trembled and her breath hitched in response. \"It inspires a man to touch and to taste.": "Alexandra",
  "She sighed. \u201cWhat I wouldn\u2019t give for a civilized bathroom.\u201d Howie remained silent out of habit and also because he didn\u2019t know what a civilized bathroom was.": "Debra",
  "He hated having to look for a new girl, a new spy to add to his band of fallen women. Yes, it was an opportunity to spare her before her ruin could be known, but a deep part of him hurt for the women in his employ and what they\u2019d all endured.": "Madeline",
  "A large man with wild blond hair gripped hr horse\u2019s reins, drawing her steed to a stop.\t\u201cWelcome to hell.\u201d Though he presented a jovial grin, his words shot straight to her gut.\t\u201cEnough, Murdoch,\u201d Sylvi said in a warning tone.\tThe man shrugged his shoulders. \u201cAch, I\u2019m just toying with the new lasses. \u201cI\u2019ll no\u2019 be here long to share my winning personality.": "Madeline",
  "With the way Bertha can cook and her good-natured personality, she\u2019ll be married in no time. We\u2019ll see to it!\u201d She cast a speculative glance around. \u201cWhy I see ten available men within a hundred feet of us. ... Bertha will manage just fine\u2026\u201c I hope.": "Debra",
  "A job isn\u2019t \u2018till death do us part\u2026": "Debra",
  "I falter in the doorway, swept with memories of my reckless behavior last time I saw him. I sipped wine from a bottle. I kissed him. And as my pulse flutters with excitement, I know I would do it again, given the chance.": "Meghan",

  "Temperance Dews stood with quiet confidence, a respectable women who lived in the sewer that was St. Giles. Her eyes had widened at the sight of Lazarus, but she made no move to flee. Indeed, finding a strange man in her pathetic sitting room seemed not to frighten her at all.Interesting.\u201cI am Lazarus Huntington, Lord Caire,\u201d he said.\u201cI know. What are you doing here?\u201dHe tilted his head, studying her. She knew him, yet did not recoil in horror? Yes, she\u2019d do quite well. \u201cI\u2019ve come to make a proposition to you, Mrs. Dews.\u201dStill no sign of fear, though she eyed the doorway. \u201cYou\u2019ve chosen the wrong woman, my lord.

Or nearly so.\u201dShe sighed, looked down at her tray, and then back up at him. \u201cWould you like a cup of tea?\u201dHe almost smiled. Tea? When had he last been offered something so very prosaic by a woman? He couldn\u2019t remember.But he replied gravely enough. \u201cThank you, no.\u201dShe nodded. \u201cThen if you don\u2019t mind?\u201dHe waved a hand to indicate permission.She set the tea tray on the wretched little table and sat on the padded footstool to pour herself a cup. He watched her. She was a monochromatic study. Her dress, bodice, hose, and shoes were all flat black. A fichu tucked in at her severe neckline, an apron, and cap\u2014no lace or ruffles\u2014were all white. No color marred her aspect, making the lush red of her full lips all the more startling. She wore the clothes of a nun, yet had the mouth of a sybarite.The contrast was fascinating\u2014and arousing.\u201cYou\u2019re a Puritan?\u201d he asked.Her beautiful mouth compressed. \u201cNo.": "Elizabeth",

Her heart labored to supply blood to her nerveless limbs. Every breath caused her body to lift up against his, a teasing friction of firm flesh and clean, warm linen.Beatrix was transfixed by the subtle changes in his face, the heightening color, the silver brightness of his eyes.She wondered if he were going to kiss her.And a single word flashed through her mind.Please. . .": "Lisa",

  "Before Christina could stop herself, her gaze dipped lower. Holy saints, the outline of his manhood stretched the cloth taut. She\u2019d never seen a man so well endowed. Taking a deep breath, she pressed her hand against her forehead and tried not to swoon while she forced herself to snap her gaze to his face. \u201cThey\u2019re braies, not box-ers.\u201d She bent down, picked up his blue ones and held them up. \u201cYe ken?\u201d\t\t\u201cRight, bra-ie-s,\u201d he said as if it were a new word for him. \u201cHow do you keep them up?": "Amy",
  "I'll be fine. It's just hard to love somebody who doesn't love you back,\" Fallon answered.": "Marcia",
  "God, you\u2019re beautiful,\u201d he growled while his cock throbbed with need.\t\u201cYe keep telling me that and ye\u2019ll have me believing it,\u201d she said with the sexiest, most breathless voice he\u2019d ever heard.\tHis fingers sank into her supple flesh. Her breasts were so full, so pliable, he craved to have his mouth on them, craved to suckle her nipples and listen to every soft moan. \u201cYou\u2019d best believe me, because whenever you\u2019re near, I feel like a caveman.\u201d\t\u201cA wild beast?\u201d\tHe nearly roared. \u201cThe wildest imaginable.": "Amy",
  "The engorged moon hung full and low in the sky like a yellow skull. Misshapen clouds stretched across the floating orb with elongated hands and bony fingers grasping. As they neared the docks, the gas lamps grew fewer and the streets gloomier. The cobblestones blackened as they passed the deserted brickfields. Bottle-shaped kilns spat their outrage with orange tongues of fire into the cooling air. Mangy dogs snarled in hunger and wandering sea-gulls screamed their displeasure at the hansom\u2019s passage.": "Brian",
  "I know you do not think very highly of me, but in some circles, I'm quite the thing.": "Jessie",
  "Rory did not want her.\tAfter devoting so much effort to avoid being wed to a man she did not want, she found herself bound to a man who did not want her.": "Margaret",
  "God save him, she smelled of a field of roses and tasted sweeter than port wine.\tDrawing her hands over her mouth Charlotte gasped. \u201cHugh. How did we end up on the bed?\u201d\t\u201cI think we must have floated,\u201d he whispered.": "Amy",
  "Steeling her resolve, she stepped further into the study. \u201cRegardless if I have your blessing, I have made up my mind. I love Hugh Maclain. It is he whom I will wed.\u201d\tPap guzzled the remaining dregs. Slamming the bottle to the table with a belch, his gaze wandered to the hearth rather than to Charlotte. \u201cNo.\u201d He drew the word out and it hung in the air and chilled like death. \u201cYou cannot marry a corpse.": "Amy",
  "He pulled her into his arms. Closing his eyes, he savored every inch of her small frame. God, why did she have to be the daughter of the Governor of Fort William? Why could she not be a simple lass from his clan. \u201cOch, mo leannan, what am I to do with you?\u201d\tShe took in a stilted gasp. \u201cLove me.": "Amy",
  "She held her finger to his lips. \u201cWe have a lifetime to reveal our secrets.\u201d\tIn a bold move, she took his hand and led him to the bed.\tEver so eager to follow, Hugh\u2019s mouth suddenly went dry. Hell, he couldn\u2019t even manage a swallow. \u201cAre you ready, my love?\u201d he croaked.\tLicking those delectable lips, she nodded. \u201cI want you more than the air I breathe.": "Amy",
  "Would you like to see where I will build your house, m\u2019lady?\u201d\tShe grinned. \u201cYou mean our house?\u201d\tHe mirrored her smile. \u201cAye.\u201d\tTaking her hand, he led her along the path to the mouth of the River Coe. They stood on a curved peninsula high above the river where it would be free from floods. Hugh spread his arms wide and looked across Loch Leven. \u201cThe hills of Glencoe will be our backdrop, the river of the Coe will be our music, and our galleys will sail through the water of the Leven to Loch Linnhe and out to sea. Mark me, my love, Clan Iain Abrach will rebuild, and will once again rule these lands.\u201d\tHe looked into her eyes and saw joy there. \u201cAnd you will be my queen.": "Amy",
  "Our glass train, on fragile tracksBeneath bombs that fall like the floodTo wash away the shards\u2014But all this sorrow will recedeAnd we will leaveTwo by twoAnd until then, I will only think of you.": "Danny",
  "Perhaps... Perhaps he could make her happy. Not with the Granville money or his social cachet, but just by being the man he was, at his core. Sometimes, when he looked deep into those blue eyes, it felt like anything was possible.": "Tessa",
  "You should not have kissed me,\" she replied breathlessly.\"I do a lot of things I shouldn't. It does not mean I won't do them again.": "Amy",
  "Her beloved lunatic needed her\u2013whether he knew it or not. Whatever it took, she was not leaving without him.": "Gaelen",
  "... but we\u2019ll be back for dinner \u2026 especially if you\u2019re having soup de jour!\u201d\u201cNow, Troy! You know very well that soup de jour means \u2018soup of the day.\u2019 It changes every time!": "Kellyn",
  "Yes, and you did it spectacularly. They were the best non words ever not spoken.": "Robert",
  "Helen likes Brussels sprouts. How can anyone trust her opinion?": "Lisa",
  "Love was like a stock, Lizzie realized. You gambled on its paying off in the long run\u2014but it could just as easily cost you everything.": "Joanna",
  "He kissed her temple. \"Would you read to me?\"\t\"You wouldn't grow bored?\"\t\"Not if you were reading, my love.\"\tHelen slipped off the bed, tiptoed into the main chamber and retrieved the book from the table. When she returned, Eoin had situated the candelabra to provide good light, and arranged the pillows for comfort.\tHow wonderful it was to be with a man who actually cared enough to do simple things like fluffing the pillows.\tHe opened his arms and beckoned her to him. \"Come and tell me what this story's about.\"\t\"It would be my pleasure, sir knight.\" Helen climbed up and snuggled into his arms. She opened the cover and read the title. \"'The Wedding of Sir Gawain and Dame Ragnelle'.\" She looked at Eoin and grinned. \"The story begins when the mystical knight, Sir Gromer Somer Joure, challenges King Arthur to discover what women desire most, or face dire consequences.\"\tHe rested his chin on her shoulder and peered at the pages. \"You have me entranced already.": "Amy",
  "I love stepping back in time": "Frances",
  "Strange how a tiny hand could make the weight of his new responsibilities feel like a boulder on his chest.": "Margaret",
  "The first time Christina and Lachlan Meet ...Christina wasn't about to stop fighting\u2014not until she took her last breath. Boring down with her heels, she thrashed. \"Get off me, ye brute.\" She would hold her son in her arms this day if it was the last thing she did. And by the shift of the crushing weight on her chest, she only had moments before her life's breath completely whooshed from her lungs. The very thought of dying whilst her son was still held captive infused her with strength. With a jab, she slammed the heel of her hand across the man's chin. He flew from her body like a sack of grain. Praises be, had the Lord granted her with superhuman strength? Blinking, Christina sat up. No, no. Her strike hadn't rescued her from the pillager. A champion had. A behemoth of a man pummeled the pikeman's face with his fists. \"Never. Ever.\" His fists moved so fast they blurred. \"Harm. A. Woman!\" Bloodied and battered, the varlet dropped to the dirt. A swordsman attacked her savior from behind. \"Watch out,\" she cried, but before the words left her lips the warrior spun to his feet. Flinging his arm backward, he grabbed his assailant's wrist, stopped the sword midair and flipped the cur onto his back. Onward, he fought a rush of English attackers with his bare hands, without armor. Not even William Wallace himself had been so talented. This warrior moved like a cat, anticipating his opponent's moves before they happened. Five enemy soldiers lay on their backs. \"Quickly,\" the man shouted, running toward her, his feet bare. No sooner had she rolled to her knees than his powerful arms clamped around her. The wind whipped beneath her feet. He planted her bum in the saddle. \"Behind!\" Christina screamed, every muscle in her body clenching taut. Throwing back an elbow, the man smacked an enemy soldier in the face resulting in a sickening crack. She picked up her reins and dug in her heels. \"Whoa!\" The big man latched onto the skirt of her saddle and hopped behind her, making her pony's rear end dip. But the frightened galloway didn't need coaxing. He galloped away from the fight like a deer running from a fox. Christina peered around her shoulder at the mass of fighting men behind them. \"My son!\" \"Do you see him?\" the man asked in the strangest accent she'd ever heard. She tried to turn back, but the man's steely chest stopped her. \"They took him.\" \"Who?\" \"The English, of course.\" The more they talked, the further from the border the galloway took them. \"Huh?\" the man mumbled behind her like he'd been struck in the head by a hammer. Everyone for miles knew the Scots and the English were to exchange a prisoner that day. The champion's big palm slipped around her waist and held on\u2014it didn't hurt like he was digging in his fingers, but he pressed firm against her. The sensation of such a powerful hand on her body was unnerving. It had been eons since any man had touched her, at least gently. The truth? Aside from the brutish attack moments ago, Christina's life had been nothing but chaste. White foam leached from the pony's neck and he took in thunderous snorts. He wouldn't be able to keep this pace much longer. Christina steered him through a copse of trees and up the crag where just that morning she'd stood with King Robert and Sir Boyd before they'd led the Scottish battalion into the valley. There, she could gain a good vantage point and try to determine where the backstabbing English were heading with Andrew this time. At the crest of the outcropping, she pulled the horse to a halt. \"The pony cannot keep going at this pace.\" The man's eyebrows slanted inward and he gave her a quizzical stare. Good Lord, his tempest-blue eyes pierced straight through her soul. \"Are you speaking English?": "Amy",
  "Blessed desire gripped her nether parts as her passion inflamed. Helen shamelessly rocked her hips from side to side. \"My, you have turned me into a wanton woman.\"\t\"And that's a bad thing?\" His voice grew deeper with each word.": "Amy",
  "Indulge me this once, Meg. Her name was a whisper on his lips. Soft. Seductive. Meanwhile his eyes gleamed mischievously, daring her to say yes.": "Anna",
  "There was no denying it; his wicked words thrilled her. Like a feather slowly brushing over her bare skin, they teased and tantalized, awakening every inch of her body.": "Anna",
  "For her, their romantic interlude atop the staircase had been a glorious, magical, enlightening introduction to pleasure. For him,it had merely been Friday evening.": "Anna",
  "to want any woman so badly was unwise, let alone his enemy's daughter.\" An Artful Seduction": "Tina",
  "Burning her husband's bed was a mistake. Alison could see that now.": "Margaret",
  "David strode through the battle raging between his men and the castle defenders in the courtyard and headed straight for the keep, intent on his goal.The castle would fall quickly. The defenders lacked leadership and were in disarray. His only concern was whether the castle had a secret tunnel for escape. During the siege, he had spread his men out through the fields surrounding the fortress to keep watch. But he had concentrated his forces for the attack and most were now inside the castle. If there was a tunnel, he must secure the widow and her daughters before they had a chance to escape. He did not relish the idea of having to chase them down through the fields with dogs.The defenders had foolishly waited too long to withdraw to the keep, and most were caught in the courtyard when David\u2019s men burst through the gate. He barely spared them a glance as he ran up the steps of the keep.With several of his warriors at his back, he burst through the doors brandishing his sword. He paused inside the entrance to hall. Women and children were screaming, and the few Blackadder warriors who had made it inside were overturning tables in a useless attempt to set up a defense.\u201cIf ye hope for mercy, drop your weapons,\u201d David shouted, making his voice heard above the chaos.He locked gazes with the men who hesitated to obey his order until every weapon clanked to the floor, then he swept his gaze over the women. Their clothing confirmed what he\u2019d known the moment he entered the hall. Blackadder\u2019s widow was not in the room.\u201cWhere is she?\u201d he demanded of the closest Blackadder man.\u201cWho, m\u2019lord?\u201d the man said, shifting his gaze to the side.\u201cYour mistress!\u201d David picked him up by the front of his tunic and leaned in close. \u201cTell me now.\u201d\u201cIn her bedchamber,\u201d the man squeaked, pointing to an arched doorway. \u201c\u2019Tis up the stairs.\u201dDavid caught a sudden whiff of urine and dropped the man to the floor in disgust. The wretch had wet himself.\u201cTake him to the dungeon,\u201d he ordered. The coward had given up his mistress far too easily.": "Margaret",
  "David started up the wheeled stairs to the upper floors with his sword at the ready. He expected to encounter Blackadder warriors, protecting the lady of the castle. But there were none on the stairs and none guarding the door on the first floor.Damn it. She must have escaped. He gritted his teeth as he envisioned the lady\u2019s guards leading her through the tunnel.He was about to open the chamber door to make sure it was empty when Brian, one of his best men, came down the stairs.\u201cLaird, I checked all the chambers while ye were in the hall,\u201d he said.David\u2019s jaw ached from clenching it.\u201cThere\u2019s one door on the floor just above us that wouldn\u2019t open with the latch,\u201d Brian said. \u201cShall I break it down?\u201dDavid waved him aside and pulled the ax from his belt as he raced up the stairs.\u201cOpen it!\u201d he shouted and pounded on the door.He did not wait. She could be escaping through a secret door this very moment. Three hard whacks with his ax, and the door split. He kicked it until it swung open, then stepped through.At his first sight of the woman, his feet became fixed to the floor. He felt strange, and his vision was distorted, as if as if he had swallowed a magical potion that narrowed his sight. He could see nothing in the room but her.She was extraordinarily lovely, with violet eyes, pale skin, and shining black hair. But there was something about her, something beyond her beauty, that held him captive. She was young, much younger than he expected, and her features and form were delicate, in marked contrast to the violent emotion in her eyes.David knew to the depths of his soul that a brute like him should not be the man to claim this fragile flower, even while the word mine beat in his head like a drum. He had no notion of how long he stood staring at her before he became aware that she held a sword. It was longer still before he noticed the two wee lasses peeking out from behind her like frightened kittens.Anger boiled up in his chest. Every Blackadder man in the castle who could still draw breath should have been here, standing between him and their lady. Instead, she faced him alone with a sword she could barely lift with both hands.It was a brave, but ridiculous gesture.There was no defense against him.": "Margaret",
  "Loyalty is everything to him,\u201d Robbie said. \u201cHe expected ye to trust him, to believe in him, without requiring an explanation.\u201d She had failed David, and he could not forgive her.": "Margaret",
  "I should never have expected loyalty from a Douglas,\u201d he spat out. He turned his back on her and went to the window.": "Margaret",
  "I was a possession he had a right to use, a woman with no feelings that mattered.\u201d Wedderburn still did not speak. \u201cI don\u2019t want to feel like that again,\u201d she said in a whisper. Wedderburn\u2019s eyes were dark with a violent emotion, but his hands were gentle as he held her face. \u201cYou\u2019ll never be just any woman to me,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to know you, Alison Douglas.": "Margaret",
  "She smiled, and her smile was filled with all of the sweetness and forgiveness that she offered so freely - and that he didn't deserve. But maybe, as with God, it was time to finally stop condemning himself and accept the gift.": "Jody",
  "A good man would tell you to stop writing. A good man would say to you, \u201cNo, love, don\u2019t wait for me. Live your life.\u201d A good man would be happy that you were off somewhere in the world doing all the things you deserve. But, Miss Ada, I am no good man. I am, in fact, selfish, very bleeding selfish when it comes to you. Good man or no, I will tell you I believe a life lived without love is one not worthy of living a\u2019tall.": "Eden",
  "Most of my money remains in England, although my unworthy carcass may not under usual circumstances ...": "Kellyn",
  "I\u2019m going to take Charity to France. I can look after her there. You can go on with your life here, and I won\u2019t be here to \u2026 to bother anyone.\u201dHe muttered two quiet words.\u201cWhat?\u201d she asked in bewilderment, inching forward to hea": "Lisa",
  "What do ladies wear beneath their riding trousers?\"\"I would think an infamous rake would already know.\"\"I was never infamous. In fact, I'm fairly standard as far as rakes go.\"\"The ones who deny it are the worst.": "Lisa",
  "He slipped his tongue between her lips and thrust it wantonly inside her mouth over and over, echoing the enticing move of his hips against hers. She clutched him closer, reveling in the feel of him, and the fact that she'd made him moan for her, whisper her name over and over, beg her without words for more. To kiss him more. To touch him more.": "Karen",
  "This was the kind of kiss you remembered when you were a very old lady with a very poor memory.": "Valerie",
  "It's a sin.\"\"How do you know?\"\"Because it feels like one,\" she managed to say.He laughed quietly and pulled her hips farther toward him with a decisiveness that drew a little yelp from her. \"In that case...I never sin by half measures.": "Lisa",
  "You took Theo's title and his home,\" West continued in appalled disbelief, \"and now you want his wife.\"\"His widow,\" Devon muttered.\"Have you seduced her?\"\"Not yet.\"West clapped his hand to his forehead. \"Christ. Don't you think she's suffered enough?": "Lisa",
  "I believe I was about to do this.\" He angled his head and nibbled on her lower lip. A small moan escaped her. Emboldened, he deepened the kiss and found she did not hesitate to explore on her own. Blood rushed to his groin and stiffened his arousal. Never had he met a lady so comfortable with her sensuality.": "Angela",
  "You tempt me beyond reason.\" Her heart sped up. Indeed he tempted her beyond reason too.": "Vonda",
  "A fire burned in her chest. A fire that both terrified her and compelled her to lean into him and take everything he would give her. She trembled with the force of these strange emotions. \t\"Shona.\" He lifted his hand to gently tilt her chin up and caress her cheek. His breath teased her lips and his nose touched hers briefly. \t\"Aye,\" she responded.\tHis masculine scent and that of spices from the mulled wine stole her thoughts. When his lips touched hers like a light brush of silk, she was ensnared and her breath remained trapped in her chest. Some instinct within her surged to the surface and she pressed her lips firmly against his.": "Vonda",
  "I should never have allowed you to kiss me.\"\t\"Saints, Shona.\" Could she not see that he cared for her? 'Twas not as if he merely wanted beneath her skirts. She had stolen his heart.": "Vonda",
  "If only she had lived back then... experienced a real ball... not this play-acting. \"Wouldn't that be amazing to truly be at this ball in 1834?\" she whispered. The silver under her thumb flared with heat. The room spun. The air, colors and sounds muted as if she was inside an abstract color painting.": "Angela",
  "Shona thought of another question. \"What does a man expect of a woman? I would have no inkling what to do.\" \tIsobel waved a hand. \"He will show you soon enough. Anyway, it will come to you as if 'twas something you'd always known. Accepting his kisses and kissing him back. Touching him. Men loved to be touched.\"\t\"Where?\"\t\"Anywhere,\" Isobel snickered. \"I remember one thing that surprised me the first time. Although I should have known considering how men are always staring down at my breasts.\"\tShona felt her eyes widen again, then tried to hide her shock.\t\"Men love to kiss and suckle nipples,\" Isobel whispered. \t\"Heavens, you cannot be serious.\" Shona felt like the most naive person on earth at that moment. \t\"Indeed, I am. That is why they're always gawking at women's breasts, even when they're covered my layers of clothing. They also like to fondle, squeeze, kiss and stroke them.\"\tShona cleared her throat. She had never imagined such a thing.": "Vonda",
  "Her passion for these items lit her eyes. The claws for instinct and desire gripped him. Her passion for history, he had to drink it, transmute it into another kind of passion. He framed her face with his hands, pushed her back into the recess between the two cases, and captured her silken mouth with his own.": "Angela",
  "The rapid pulse in her wrist vibrated against his lips. His own rhythm matching the jumps in her heartbeat. He closed his eyes, breathed in her sweet scent one last time, and looked down into her eyes. She stared back at him, boldly assessing. God help him. He could not seduce her. He could not live with himself if he did. Expecting her to remove her hand, he closed his eyes again and sighed softly, willing his body to relax. Her hand slowly left his face. This is for the best. His heart and body ached at the loss and the unfulfillment of his desires. The next instant, her gentle hand stroked his chin and bottom lip and his whole body jerked. He kept his eyes closed, afraid to break the spell. Warm fingers slid down his neck. Shivers coursed up and down his spine. Sweet was the torment and fragile was his control as he felt it slip away.": "Angela",
  "He crushed her mouth in a searing, hungry kiss. A kiss that made her stomach drop away.": "Angela",
  "The breeze was calm and the sun beamed between the scattering clouds. Glancing across the rolling heather-covered landscape and toward the burn, he didn't see Remy or anyone else. \"Twas too bad that the heather was not in bloom for the sight would have been lovely. Glancing up, he noticed something else. A giant double rainbow spanned across the horizon, one slightly dimmer than the other. \t\"Ah,\" he halted and turned in the saddle. \"Have you ever seen such a bonny rainbow?\"\tShona gasped. \"Nay. 'Tis very bright.\"\tEven lovelier, at least to Keegan, was Shona's smile as she took in the scenery. She was so beautiful, his chest ached. Yet, he knew not how he was going to keep her in his life so that he might see her smile every day.": "Vonda",
  "She dropped her hand, but he caught it and kissed her palm. His lips and warm breath on her sensitive skin fragmented her thoughts. His gaze held hers with that intense, magnetic force she didn't understand. It compelled her to draw closer to him. And she did. He leaned forward and placed a sweet kiss on her lips. It surprised her and served as a potent temptation. Unable to quell her enthusiasm, she lifted herself onto her tiptoes and tilted her chin up hungering for another kiss like the one they'd shared the night before. \t\"Saints!\" Keegan growled, then took her mouth. His wicked tongue flicked at her lips and she opened for him - completely ready to devour him. But he did not seem in a hurry as he tempted and taunted her, barely touching his tongue to hers, then retreating. A sound escaped her and she was shocked to realize that it was halfway between a moan and a needy whine. He gave an answering groan and stroked his tongue inside her mouth. It darted around hers and then swirled. He hummed a soft sound. \"So sweet,\" he whispered.": "Vonda",
  "How could he live never knowing what it would be like to hold her close and sleep with her the whole night through?": "Vonda",
  "With a hoarse moan, he swept her against him, kissing her wildly, passionately, his mouth promising and teasing, as if her kiss had broken the dam that had held back his passion.": "Karen",
  "You challenge me to be a better person. And no one else does that, except maybe my mother.": "Jody",
  "You can't be perfect. No one is. That's why we need God.": "Jody",
  "And the only hope-perhaps the real hope he'd been missing all along-was found in God.": "Jody",
  "You're safe now.": "Jody",
  "Her face a mask of fury and determination.": "Jody",
  "But she'd learned instead to hope in the one Beacon that would always be there, no matter what darkness came her way.": "Jody",
  "In my dictionary, romance is not maudlin, treacly sentiment. It is a curry, spiced with excitement, and humour, and a healthy dollop of cynicism.": "Loretta",
  "The love within them shone as brightly as the lighthouse beam on the darkest, stormiest night. It broke through her confusion and heartache and filled her with a warm glow.": "Jody",
  "He inclined his head toward a fallen log. \"Come. Let us break our fast.\"\tShe pushed the heels of her hands against her temples as if she had an ache in her head. \"I need a cup of coffee.\"\tWilliam sat on a log. \"What is this ye say ... coffee?\"\tShe looked at him and arched one brow as if she considered him daft. \"It's a hot drink that helps me wake up in the morning.\"\t\"But ye are already awake.": "Amy",
  "You are charismatic. Men are drawn to you. I am drawn to you. And by your size, let alone your skill with weapons, they will be in awe of you.": "Amy",
  "She swatted the fur beside her. \"Sit.\"\tGrowling, he shoved his dirk back in its sheath. \"I'll listen, but if ye lift a finger against me, I'll slit your throat afore ye can draw your next breath.\"\t\"I'll keep that in mind.\" Eva smoothed her fingers over her throat ...": "Amy",
  "Isn't one man's truth another man's lie?": "Amy",
  "Barely able to breathe, Eva's tongue slipped across her lips.\tHe moved a bit closer. \"Every time ye walk past, I want ye. Your scent sends my insides into a maelstrom of need.\"\tShe closed her eyes and drew out the moment, wishing he'd say that again. Oh, how delectable to listen to a medieval Scotsman declare his desire.": "Amy",
  "Buchan had discovered a wealth of small tidbits. He now knew her first name - Tatiana. Like Shakespeare's fairy queen. \"Be she but little, she is fierce.": "Karen",
  "He opened his eyes to half-cast. With a low rumble he lifted her onto his hips. \"Take me to heaven, lassie. For no one but ye can cool the fire thrumming in my blood.": "Amy",
  "He picked up the hairbrush and handed it to her. \"What were you planning to do with that, comb me to death?": "Marguerite",
  "It's a jump, Minuette, that's all it is. A jump out of this world, straight into my arms.\"Incredibly, she managed to smile. \"You will catch me?\"He pressed his lips against hers. \"Always.": "Laura",
  "Unbridled passion with an incredibly hot seven hundred-year-old Highlander in the middle of the night? Mm Yeah. Bring it on.": "Amy",
  "Nothing could stir Eva's passion like a tall, muscular Scotsman disrobing. Lordy, she could watch him stand before her in the nude for hours.": "Amy",
  "So you wish me to forget that you are a sheikh and a prince and a crown prince and soon to be King? That is a lot to forget.": "Marguerite",
  "It is terrifyingly beautiful,\" Julia said softly.\t\"Terrifying?\"\t\"Nature at its most beautiful and most lethal. It is like standing on the edge of one of those lakes in Switzerland, so blue and so calm and so deep and so dangerous. You have the overwhelming urge to plunge in, even though you know the cold will kill you. This desert - your desert - it makes me want to walk into it and keep walking. You probably think I'm being ridiculously fanciful.\"\t\"I would not have put it in those words, but they are exactly how I feel about Qaryma. Terrifyingly beautiful.": "Marguerite",
  "There is an old saying, that in the desert a camel is more useful than a kingdom,\" he said ruefully, \"but as a location for lovemaking, it leaves a lot to be desired.": "Marguerite",
  "She was riding a camel, in the most beautiful desert, in the kingdom belonging to this most beautiful man. A man who thought she had the most delightful rear. A man who wanted to kiss her every bit as much as she wanted to kiss him. \"I know that I will regret saying this, but at this moment in time, I think I could manage anything.": "Marguerite",
  "There is nothing more effective in igniting a man's desire than a woman's passion. To see the fire in your eyes, to feel the fire in your blood as you touch me, it sets me on fire too. Do you imagine I would prefer to kiss a woman who responds only with -- with compliance? No, I would not. No red-blooded man would. Never apologize for passion. Restraint, Julia, has no place in lovemaking.": "Marguerite",
  "She laced her arms around his neck. \"Are you hungry, Azhar?\"\tHis smile made her blood fizz. \"Ravenous, Julia.\"\t\"Then please, abandon any attempt at controlling your appetite for me,\" she whispered into his ear, \"Because I too am starving.": "Marguerite",
  "Was your magic carpet out of commission?": "Marguerite",
  "I thought I had to be alone to be free. But I am only ever truly myself when I am with you, Azhar. I know, that is such an -- an extravagant thing to say, but it is true. I have to realize that freedom means having the ability to choose. To choose to share your life, to choose to love unconditionally. The two are inseparable. There is no freedom without love and there is no love without freedom.": "Marguerite",
  "She ... grabbed her bra, clasping it and shoving her arms through.\t\"Ye harness your udders?\" The man was insufferable.\t\"For your information, it's a bra - short for brassiere, something that wasn't invented until the twentieth century.": "Amy",
  "In a heartbeat, he scarcely could take a breath.\tWearing not a stitch of clothing, Eva stood in thigh-deep water with her back to him.\tBefore he blinked, his gaze slid from coppery tresses brushing feminine shoulders to a tiny waist which fanned into glorious heart-shaped buttocks. Heaven's stars, her flawless skin had to be as pure white as fresh cream.\tGod on the cross, save me.\tChrist, he was only a flesh and blood man. Who on earth could resist such a temptation? He clenched his teeth and growled. Frigid water or nay, he lengthened like a stallion catching scent of a filly in heat. God's teeth, even his ballocks turned to balls of tight molten steel.": "Amy",
  "Before her, with sharp blue eyes and perfectly coiffed blond hair, was Josephine Marie Elizabeth Cavendish, Her Grace, the Duchess of Durham, widow of the fifth duke, and aunt to the Cavendish siblings.One did not call her Josie. Amelia had asked.": "Maya",
  "It was a chaste kiss, but as her lips brushed his warm cheek, her eyes met his. They were deep and dark, warm with passion and longing. And somehow she knew, without question, what he thought. What he felt.\tTime held its breath - and in that moment, looking into Buchan's warm, tormented gaze, Tatiana's heart awoke.": "Karen",
  "Beware, lion\u2019s lady, for your predator is hungry tonight. He may not wait long before devouring you.\u201d \u201cDevouring me?\u201d she asked, challenge gleaming in her eyes. \u201cWhat if I devour him first?": "Shelly",
  "To know, finally, what love is and not be allowed fulfilment ...": "Anne",
  "All of them. Fated to love in vain.": "Anne",
  "It doesna matter the direction necessity forces ye to take in life, it matters which way ye go when ye have a choice.": "Madeline",
  "No more sounds emerged as he walked through the forest, save the whisper of the leaves above. Though nothing further appeared out of the ordinary, he knew one thing for certain.\tHe was not alone.": "Madeline",
  "Did I catch ye looking at me?\" He knelt beside her and covered her with the plaid...\t\"I couldn't help myself,\" she mumbled.\tHe gave a low chuckle and slid in beside her. His naked arm pulled her close so her head rested on his solid chest.\t\"Good answer.\" The smile was evident in his silky voice.": "Madeline",
  "What are you cooking this night, wife?\u201d One of the crepes picked that moment to dislodge itself from the ceiling. It landed at her feet with a plop as if on cue. \u201cCrepes.\u201d She kept a straight face and tried to look like this was the normal way to make crepes.": "Shelly",
  "Time. She had to go home. As soon as the lunar eclipse occurred in three weeks. Because if she stayed here, she would die. Either from the bullet in her back, or from the pain that was slowly sinking talons into her.": "Shelly",
  "It seems you want me at your mercy, Princess. Question is, why?No, she whispered, question is do I?": "Meg",
  "Only two things kept her from loathing him.The expression on his face when he'd said, \"France.\" And the expression on his face when he'd said, \"home.": "Julie",
  "A fierce possessiveness gripped him, a need to brand her, to make her his, now and forever. And he knew it was madness.": "Shelly",
  "She didn\u2019t have a hat or a veil or anything in her hands. No one had offered so much as a single dried-out flower; she had nothing to hold onto to steady her shaking fingers. Her head pounded as hard and as painfully as her rapid heartbeat. She stood there, unable to move, staring at the man who waited at the end of the aisle. This unpredictable knight who hours ago had touched her, kissed her, caressed her in a way that still made her tremble, then sworn he would never do so again. This dark lord who despised her. This man she was about to marry.": "Shelly",
  "Once the spark of true love has been ignited, it cannot be quenched. It is there forever.": "Anne",
  "It is true, Monsieur, that when you die, the ones who love you come for you ... I have seen it.": "Anne",
  "It proved what he had always instinctively known.Love is Forever.": "Anne",
  "Now, at last, she understood her great attraction to him. Here was the companion of her spirit. Here, indeed, was love.": "Anne",
  "Why are we fated to love those we cannot have ...?": "Anne",
  "His mouth captured hers with a strong, soft heat and Celine discovered something far sexier than this man\u2019s voice or his body. His kiss. She never had the chance to think of a protest. To think at all. She had been kissed before, but never like this. It was neither awkward and teasing nor forceful and overpowering, but long, slow, confident, and devastating. It was as if he were binding them together, deftly drawing her soul into his.": "Shelly",
  "She was destroyed many years ago, La Belle, on the cobblestones of the alley beside the opera house ...": "Anne",
  "Like a brilliant shooting star, she had almost reached her zenith when her light was extinguished.": "Anne",
  "One day you will meet someone who will show you what you are made of. I only hope it is someone not forbidden to you ...": "Anne",
  "I could not give her my heart, because it already belonged to another; for I have only loved once.": "Anne",
  "And what she does not know, what nobody else knows but you, is that I have a special place where I go to be with her; my first, my only love.": "Anne",
  "Celine glanced up as she passed under an arch, at another of the chateau\u2019s decorations, her personal favorite: the entwined letters G and R, carved over every doorway. Family legend had it that one of the original owners of the chateau, a knight by the name of Sir Gaston de Varennes, was responsible for that bit of artwork. Sir Gaston, it seemed, had been quite a ladies\u2019 man\u2014until he had met and married his wife, whom he loved so much, he had had her initial engraved with his in every castle he owned.": "Shelly",
  "What takes more courage. To live ... or to die?": "Anne",
  "She did not realise that there could be a joy - a spiritual ecstasy- in the touch of a certain man, or that she would long for his touch with all her being": "Anne",
  "Life isn't worth living without love. Have faith in love! Take a chance, and you might be surprised at how well things will turn out. If you do, you'll be filled with joy. I promise.": "Caroline",
  "Eva\u2019s chin ticked up. \u201cAre you threatening me, m\u2019lord?\u201dScoffing, he gave an exaggerated eye roll. \u201cHeaven forbid someone threaten William Wallace\u2019s woman.\u201dNarrowing her eyes, she glared at him for a moment. Even if he\u2019d seen her take the pictures, he wouldn\u2019t have a clue what she was up to. And she\u2019d turned the flash off. He had absolutely no grounds on which to make any accusations. With a dismissive nod she turned her attention back to Christina.\u201cBut\u2014\u201d Comyn stepped closer, making the hackles on the back of Eva\u2019s neck stand on end. \u201cOne day that big fella will fall out of favor, and then a pretty lassie such as yourself willna be so smug.\u201d\u201cI beg your pardon, Lord Comyn?\u201d Lady Murray threw her shoulders back. \u201cYou over inflate your station. Regardless of your noble birth, Miss Eva is the daughter of a knight, and I daresay she ought not be spoken to like a mere commoner.\u201d\u201cNot to worry.\u201d Eva flashed a wry grin. \u201cI am very comfortable being identified as among the loyal servants of Scotland. Unlike some high-ranking gentry present whose questionable actions have proved their very hypocrisy, and their willingness to change allegiances on a whim only to protect their personal wealth.": "Amy",
  "I suppose,\u201d continued Nate, \u201cit\u2019s not Bertie\u2019s fault that he lacks the physical stature to carry a delicate young woman such as yourself a good distance. I believe he did not care to see you within the folds of my arms which were reluctant to release you, for I thought I would never see you again...": "Margie",
  "He wished for access to all the world's languages at once, for then he would have a better word for how he felt and what she was.": "Julie",
  "Her smile hollowed out his chest. She\u2019d changed since last he saw her. She was brighter. More vibrant. Happiness suited her.": "Carolyn",
  "You want me at your mercy, Princess. Question is, why?\u201d\u201cNo,\u201d she whispered. \u201cQuestion is, do I?": "Meg",
  "Susanna, I'm not exactly sure how to begin. Where to start. I know I was in the wrong by not telling you sooner, but I was in an incredibly tight spot.\"\tShe crooked her brow.\t\"I'm still in an incredibly tight spot?\"\tShe nodded.": "Caroline",
  "I do have a girl that sets the moon and stars.": "Caroline",
  "Look through that clump of trees. There's a hawk sitting on the weathervane at the Red Rooster Inn. I've heard that if someone you love very much passes away, they can come back in the form of a hawk, to look after you and give you comfort.": "Caroline",
  "Why does sin feel so good if it is a terrible thing?": "Amy",
  "He nodded. A curt movement of his head, and she was, for no reason at all, convinced that the man before her was not in dislike of her but simply a man who did not have words come easily to him because he\u2019d grown up alone. She thought of him as a boy. Lonely here, with no father and no mother to hold him, only the servants for company, and Killhope as an unceasing reminder of the centuries of duty and responsibility that were his. Her heart twisted up.": "Carolyn",
  "She looked over her shoulder at him, as ever, not in the least affected by him or his consequence. Not one whit. She was a lady, yes, but she would never believe herself the sort of woman who might marry a duke. \u201cYou aren\u2019t the sentimental sort, are you?\u201d \u201cI\u2019m told not.\u201d She considered him, and he felt the curiosity behind her scrutiny of him. He had no idea what to make of that and so pushed off the wall he\u2019d leaned against and headed for the door. She followed.": "Carolyn",
  "There is a view,\u201d he said. \u201cYou will admire it.\u201d A command. All wrong. He meant for her to hear that he wanted her to see the view, but no. By habit, he demanded that she accompany him. \u201cI should like for you to see it. Please.": "Carolyn",
  "She cocked her head. The ribbon tied beneath her chin glinted dully in the light. \u201cHave I said something wrong?\u201d\u201cNo.\"\u201cI have.\u201d She stepped closer. \u201cYou are the most inscrutable man I have ever met.\u201d He laughed. No mirth at all. \u201cI\u2019m quite serious.\u201d She studied him. \u201cNo.\u201d Her quiet voice lanced through him. \u201cDon\u2019t look away. Not when I am about to understand you.\u201d \u201cAre you certain you wish to?\u201d He held her gaze, and the silence of his hunting box became unendurable. He fixed in his head an image of her in his bed. Nude. And of him, there to touch, and taste, experiencing that moment when his prick slid into her body. Her. Not any woman, but her. Specifically. The woman who made him see beauty where he\u2019d once seen only duty.": "Carolyn",
  "Miss Edith Clay brightened the room with her presence. Just from walking through the door, she\u2019d made the room a happier place. This was true despite his having spent the last several months assuring himself his recollection of her had to be incorrect. His recollection was not incorrect. It was appallingly accurate.": "Carolyn",
  "I-I've wanted you ever since...\" She untied the sash around her waist and let the dressing gown drop to the floor.\tGod save him, she wore not a stitch of clothing. Every shred of self-control fled. His mind consumed with the tantalizing woman before him. Somehow she was even more beautiful now that he'd remembered. The candlelight flickered amber across her skin. Chestnut tresses slid over her shoulder, framing two perfectly formed breasts, tipped by rose.\tSean licked his lips, those delectable rosebuds would be his second stop. In two strides, he wrapped her in his arms and crushed his body against hers. \"For all that is holy, you have claimed my soul, my flesh and my mind.": "Amy",
  "She had a good, strong voice. She smiled with her voice, too. This, he thought, was the magic that had drawn him to her.": "Carolyn",
  "Her gaze collided with the duke\u2019s. His eyes were a clear, pale green. Why was he staring so intently when there was hardly another woman less interesting than she?": "Carolyn",
  "You are walking to Hope Springs?\u201d \u201cYes, Your Grace.\u201d \u201cIn this weather?\u201d She glanced around and gave him a smile. \u201cI haven\u2019t any other weather to walk in.": "Carolyn",
  "He\u2019d seen that absent look from her dozens of times in London. She thought herself invisible, and was not. Not to him. This was the second time he\u2019d mentioned marriage to her. The second time she heard nothing but his words.": "Carolyn",
  "If he spoke, there was no possible outcome but another disastrous exchange of words at cross-purposes. The chances of him finding both the right words and the right inflection were, in his experience with her thus far, vanishingly small. He would either growl at her, or tell her what was in his heart.": "Carolyn",
  "Dread that she would meet some other man and see in him all the joy of life that he lacked. \u201cI will see you home.\u201d The words came out all wrong, with gruff emphasis on the word will. One look at her, and he lost all chance at serenity. Because he had never in his life cared whether anyone liked him. He\u2019d never thought about it. Until her.": "Carolyn",
  "She bent her head over the flowers. He knew she was not beautiful. He knew she did not see herself as the object of a man\u2019s lust. He knew if he told her he found her desirable, she\u2019d not understand his meaning. She\u2019d think he meant something other than marriage. In that, she would be right, but a man could want both things from the same woman.": "Carolyn",
  "He fell quiet, but she understood this was his way. He was not a talkative man. Once, she\u2019d imagined him sitting alone in his house, a monster ready to devour anyone who came near. What she imagined now was a man who had both his rank and his natural reticence working against him. She smiled at him. If he continued in his gruff ways the rest of his life, she would defend him to anyone. Anyone.": "Carolyn",
  "She laughed, and the duke might actually have smiled, though one could never be certain.": "Carolyn",
  "He remounted. \u201cI will ride with you.\u201d With some effort, he gentled his voice. \u201cIf that would be agreeable to you.\u201d \u201cHow kind of you. Thank you.": "Carolyn",
  "She laughed, and the sound pierced his heart.": "Carolyn",
  "She wanted to savor him slowly like a lemon cream pie on a lazy summer day. One bite at a time.": "Sandra",
  "You\u2019re a pirate?\u201d Obviously. Still, hard to believe. He pressed forward, forcing on her a series of blows meant to test her strength and will.She parried and blocked his every move with an aptitude that amazed. \u201cAye. A pirate, and captain of the Sea Sprite,\u201d she boasted, a wry smile upon her full lips.Indeed, she appeared very much a pirate in her men\u2019s garb\u2014a threadbare, brown suit with overly long sleeves she\u2019d had to roll up. Her ebony hair had been pulled back in a queue and was half hidden beneath a rumpled tricorn. Also, like her men, was her look of desperation and the grim cast to her countenance that bespoke of a hard existence.\u201cWe offered you quarter,\u201d she said as she evaded his thrust with ease. \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you surrender? You had to know we outnumbered you.\u201dHe didn\u2019t answer. In all honesty, he\u2019d thought they could defeat the pirates, if not with cannon fire, then with skill. After hearing of all the pirate attacks of late, they\u2019d hired on additional hands, men who could fight. If it hadn\u2019t been for the damn illness\u2026\u201cIt\u2019s not too late. You can save what\u2019s left of your crew. Surrender now, Captain Glanville, and we\u2019ll see that your men are ransomed back.\u201d A wicked gleam brightened her eyes as if victory would soon be hers. He should do as she asked. It would be the sensible thing, but pride kept him from saying the words. Not yet. He still had another opponent to defeat, and so far she hadn\u2019t been an easy one to overcome. Despite his steady attack, she kept her muscles relaxed, her balance sure. Her attention followed his movements no matter how small, adjusting her stance, looking for weaknesses. \u201cHow do you know I\u2019m Captain Glanville?\u201d When work was at hand, he didn\u2019t dress any differently than his men.\u201cI know much about you.\u201d Stepping clear of two men battling to their left, she blocked his sword with her own and lunged with her dagger. He jumped from the blade, avoiding injury by the barest inch. This one relied on speed and accuracy rather than power. Smart woman.\u201cWhat do you want from us?\u201d he asked, launching an attack of his own, this time with so much force and speed, she had no choice but to retreat until her back came up against the railing. \u201cWe only just left London four days ago. Our cargo is mainly iron and ale.\u201dHer gaze sharpened even as her expression became strained. His assault was wearing her down. \u201cI want the Ruby Cross.\u201dHow the hell did she know he had the cross? And did she believe he\u2019d simply hand it over? Hand over a priceless antiquity of the Knights Templar? Absurd. He swung his sword all the harder. The clang of steel rang through the air. Her reactions slowed, and her arms trembled. He made a final cut, putting all his strength behind the blow, and knocked her sword from her hand. Triumph surged through his veins. She attempted to slash out with her dagger. He grabbed her arm before her blade could reach him and hauled her close, their faces nose to nose. \u201cYou\u2019ll never take the cross from me,\u201d he vowed as he towered over her, his grip strong.The point of a sword touched his back. Thomas tensed, he swore beneath his breath, self-disgust heavy in his chest. The distraction of this one woman had sealed his fate.Bloody hell.": "Tamara",
  "Jacques appeared on his hands and knees, peering around the corner of the cabin. His dark eyes lit with pleasure when he saw her. The baby flashed Antonia his wide grin and scooted toward her. Only in the last two days had he gone from pushing himself across the floor to a hands-and-knees crawl.Henri trailed so close behind Jacques that he had to walk wide-legged so he didn\u2019t step on his brother.The baby reached her, placed his hands on her legs, and pressed himself up, grabbing at the front of her tunic. \u201cMaa.\u201dAntonia hugged Jacques. He\u2019d soiled his rabbit skin diaper and smelled, but she held him close, needing to feel the baby in her arms. He wiggled in protest. She dropped a kiss on his forehead and reached up to her shoulder to unlace the leather ties of her tunic, pulling the flap down to free her breast. He began to suckle greedily.Henri dropped to her other side and leaned against her. Antonia put her arm around him. Just holding her sons brought her comfort but also increased her despair. What do I be doin\u2019 now? Should I be takin\u2019 the boys and leave? Head for Sweetwater Springs?Antonia shook her head. No! I won\u2019t be leavin\u2019 Jean-Claude. Cain\u2019t leave my home.But without her husband to provide for them, she didn\u2019t know how long she\u2019d be able to manage on her own.Somehow, I\u2019ll be findin\u2019 a way, Antonia vowed.": "Debra",

  "Every morning,\" he said softly, his breath caressing her cheek. \"You were my only thought.\" He tilted closer. \"Every night, you were my only thought.\" His lips brushed her cheekbone. \"Every moment of every day, you were my only thought.": "Erica",
  "I may be dead inside, but I'm more than alive enough for you.\" He gripped her chin and covered her mouth with his.": "Erica",
  "He tasted like Edmund, smelled like Edmund, felt like second chances. He kissed her as if she were as indispensable as air. As though his every heartbeat belonged as much to her as it did to him.": "Erica",
  "She turned to him with wide, shocked eyes. \"Why did he...\"\tHis lips twitched. No coarse language in front of the infants limited the ability to discuss the fountain of baby piss that had just arced halfway across the room.\t\"Twasn't you, darling. It's one of their favorite bath-time games.\t\"Something about the cool air on their naked...berries,\" he substituted at the last second....\t\"Do I have piddle in my hair?\" she whispered, her eyes sparkling with laughter above her flushed cheeks.\t\"Not much,\" he assured her with a straight face. \"You look almost becoming.\"...\t\"Decades from now, when our children ask how I fell in love with their mother, I'll say 'twas her sweet, gentle compliments during bath-time, and her fleetness of foot whilst dodging a flow of ---": "Erica",
  "I've come to seduce you.\"\tHis pupils dilated as his gaze heated.\tShe smiled. He hadn't been surprised at her presence, but he'd been very surprised at the reason.\tHe held up a palm. \"By all means.": "Erica",
  "Can't sleep?\" he murmured, the corners of his eyes crinkling.\tShe blushed, but held his gaze. \"Don't wish to sleep.\"\t\"Mmm. I can help with that.\"...\t\"Do you have anything particular in mind?\"\t\"Everything.": "Erica",
  "The point is, people have been having babies for thousands of years. There will be frightening moments and exhausting moments, but more than anything---\"\t\"--- there will just be love.": "Erica",
  "Be thankful all she did was raise her voice,\" Mr. Blackpool told Sarah conspiratorially. \"During the ride to London, I had to talk her out of scaling up the townhouse walls, should the door go unanswered.\"\tShe had to hide her smile at the image of flamboyant Mrs. Blackpool climbing row houses like a circus monkey. \"We are fortunate indeed that such measures did not prove necessary.": "Erica",
  "She would do whatever she had to, even make this man\u2019s life a living hell if it were required, and judging by the arrogance of Thomas Glanville, that possibility was quite likely.": "Tamara",

  "You could cut...all that": "Mel",
  "You don\u2019t have to prove something to feel it, to know it exists.": "Ally",
  "Catherine bristled at the amusement in his voice. He could laugh all he wanted when he stood tied to a wall utterly naked. A little humiliation might do him good.": "Tamara",
  "Do you miss wearing your kilt?\" she asked.\t\"In London, it caused more bother than it was worth. Ladies either found it indecent or intriguing. A fair few found it to be both. I was never quite sure whether it was indecently intriguing or intriguingly indecent!": "Marguerite",
  "Antonia Valleau cast the first shovelful of dirt onto her husband\u2019s fur-shrouded body, lying in the grave she\u2019d dug in their garden plot, the only place where the soil wasn\u2019t still rock hard. I won\u2019t be breakin\u2019 down. For the sake of my children, I must be strong. Pain squeezed her chest like a steel trap. She had to force herself to take a deep breath, inhaling the scent of loam and pine. I must be doing this.She drove the shovel into the soil heaped next to the grave, hefted the laden blade, and dumped the earth over Jean-Claude, trying to block out the thumping sound the soil made as it covered him. Even as Antonia scooped and tossed, her muscles aching from the effort, her heart stayed numb, and her mind kept playing out the last sight of her husband. The memory haunting her, she paused to catch her breath and wipe the sweat off her brow, her face hot from exertion in spite of the cool spring air.Antonia touched the tips of her dirty fingers to her lips. She could still feel the pressure of Jean-Claude\u2019s mouth on hers as he\u2019d kissed her before striding out the door for a day of hunting. She\u2019d held up baby Jacques, and Jean-Claude had tapped his son\u2019s nose. Jacques had let out a belly laugh that made his father respond in kind. Her heart had filled with so much love and pride in her family that she\u2019d chuckled, too. Stepping outside, she\u2019d watched Jean-Claude ruffle the dark hair of their six-year-old, Henri. Then he strode off, whistling, with his rifle carried over his shoulder. She\u2019d thought it would be a good day\u2014a normal day. She assumed her husband would return to their mountain home in the afternoon before dusk as he always did, unless he had a longer hunt planned.As Antonia filled the grave, she denied she was burying her husband. Jean-Claude be gone a checkin\u2019 the trap line, she told herself, flipping the dirt onto his shroud.She moved through the nightmare with leaden limbs, a knotted stomach, burning dry eyes, and a throat that felt as though a log had lodged there. While Antonia shoveled, she kept glancing at her little house, where, inside, Henri watched over the sleeping baby. From the garden, she couldn\u2019t see the doorway.She worried about her son\u2014what the glimpse of his father\u2019s bloody body had done to the boy. Mon Dieu, she couldn\u2019t stop to comfort him. Not yet. Henri had promised to stay inside with the baby, but she didn\u2019t know how long she had before Jacques woke up. Once she finished burying Jean-Claude, Antonia would have to put her sons on a mule and trek to where she\u2019d found her husband\u2019s body clutched in the great arms of the dead grizzly. She wasn\u2019t about to let his last kill lie there for the animals and the elements to claim. Her family needed that meat and the fur. She heard a sleepy wail that meant Jacques had awakened. Just a few more shovelfuls. Antonia forced herself to hurry, despite how her arms, shoulders, and back screamed in pain.When she finished the last shovelful of earth, exhausted, Antonia sank to her knees, facing the cabin, her back to the grave, placing herself between her sons and where their father lay. She should go to them, but she was too depleted to move.": "Debra",
  "I kissed you,\" Finlay said roughly. \"for the very simple reason that you are irresistible.\"\t\"I think that is what is known as serendipity,\" Isabella replied, \"for it's the very same reason I kissed you back.\"\t\"Serendipity,\" Finlay said, sliding his arm around her waist. \"I've always wondered what it tasted like.\"\t\"Strawberries, and lavender, and vintage wine, I believe is how you described it.\"\t\"No,\" he said decidedly. \"It tastes of nothing other than essence of you. The most intoxicating and delicious taste imaginable.": "Marguerite",
  "Vintage kisses,\" Finlay said. \"If only they could be bottled, you would have an elixir beyond price.": "Marguerite",
  "Those were the kind of kisses to keep a man awake at night, wanting more. Now, shall we drink this excellent wine and get on with the rest of the tour?": "Marguerite",
  "The Jock Upstart, is what Wellington calls - called me. A man who does not know his allotted place in the scheme of things.": "Marguerite",
  "I must confess, your gown does not do justice as your trousers did to your delightful derriere.\"\tColour flamed in her face. She ought to be outraged, but Isabella was briefly, shockingly inclined to laugh. \"A gentleman does not remark on a lady's derriere.\"\t\"I seem to recall telling you when last we met that I am not a gentleman, senorita. And now I come to think of it, I recall also that you took umbrage at being called a lady.": "Marguerite",
  "It was because he wanted to kiss her so much that he stopped himself, bent over her hand, clicking his heels together, then let her go. \"Adios, Isabella. Good luck. Please be careful. Stay safe.\"\t\"Goodbye, Finlay. May God protect you and keep you from harm.": "Marguerite",
  "I don\u2019t fear you. It\u2019s my feelings for you that I fear.": "Ally",
  "He stared at her, his dark eyes unfathomable. \"You could meet a better, worthier man.\"She laughed, a strained, harsh sound. \"I've already met one--he's marrying my sister!\"The words blazed forth, hanging in the air as though etched in fire, impossible to recall or deny. They stared at each other, scarcely breathing--then, in an instant, Trevenan closed the distance between them in one stride and pulled her to him, arms banding around her like iron.Their mouths met in a fierce mutual claiming, and the world went white around them--white as lightning, white as the heart of a flame. Closing her eyes, Aurelia let herself fall, deep into a void where all that existed was his touch, his taste, and the hot, urgent press of his lips against hers. This, she thought hazily. Yes, this. And knew by his response, the guttural moan in his throat, that it was the same for him. Love, that is first and last of all things made...\"Damn you, James! Why couldn't you wait for me?": "Pamela",

She\u2019d died hating him.The last remnants of her earlier contentment vanished. \u201cI like my independence.\u201d \u201cThen I guess you\u2019ll have to get used to the lectures, Sheriff Jezebel,\u201d he replied.": "Paula",
  "What the hell do you think you are doing, creeping about in the night in woman's clothing? I could just as easily have killed you?\"\tThe sheer audacity of her remark rendered him speechless for a moment, and then Finlay laughed. \"This, senorita, is a kilt, not a skirt, and you did not for a moment come close to killing me, though I don't doubt that you'd have tried if I'd given you half a chance.": "Marguerite",

  "He stopped, gazing at the girl who stood before it. The man guessed the child to be ten years old. She had dark brown hair to her neck with ends that showed curls, ivory skin and large eyes of sapphire blue. Thin and barefooted, with soot on her face she wore an old, tattered white dress.

I would have called upon you immediately, but I\u2019m afraid a prior engagement tied my hands until this very moment.\u201d He tried to make sense of her words.

  "She clenched her fists. \"I believe, milord, that I have endured my full limit of male tyranny.\" \"I am afraid, milady, that you will have to become accustomed to it.

It was as if every part of her body had at once become brilliantly alive.His beard was a startling, silky roughness against her skin. His other hand came to rest at her waist, drawing her in tight, and her body seemed to meld to his hard, lean lines, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. Her thoughts scattered. A sound escaped her, soft and deep, unlike any sound she had ever made in her life.Then his tongue touched her lower lip and she gave a startled little squeak.Her suddenly lifted his mouth from hers, his eyes midnight blue, his voice husky. \"You have never even been kissed before, leannan.

  "Her feet moved into the vast space, but all she couldsee was Cyrus. He strode through the room the way acaptain commands his ship. Was it possible his maroon bruise made him more dashing? He was a fine sight in a black broadcloth coat. Hersalacious gaze dropped to a brass button lower on hiswaistcoat. The metal glimmered, winking at her withflirtatious intent very near the tuft of hair she rememberedso well at his navel. The corner of Cyrus\u2019s mouth crooked. If shelooked ready to devour him, he read the message onher face, no words required. \u201cClaire.\u201d He said her name like a treasured sound. Then, herlandlord bent low over her hand, kissing her knucklesand keeping her fingers in a tender hold.Her flesh sung a merry tune recalling how she\u2019dgripped those broad shoulders of his in a fit of passion.Was that only two nights ago?

He must\u2019ve shaved in the last hour. Hismouth quirked sideways, pressing the maroon bruisehigher up his cheek. \u201cSomething tells me you\u2019re the perfect woman tosoothe such a man or put him in his place.\u201d His pewterstare flicked over her exposed skin, settling on hercleavage. \u201cAs to your senses, I shall treat them withthe utmost care.": "Gina",
  "They sat in a sphere of quiet, save the sound of theirbreathing and the carriage\u2019s creaks and sways. Outside,the coachman yelled his encouragement to the steedsmoving them forward.

Her hand didn\u2019t stop rubbing his neck, but sheshifted her leg, bending her knee to rest her leg onhis thigh. Her patten slipped off, dropping to the floorwith a thud. Cyrus\u2019s head moved off the squab. \u201cAre youundressing for my benefit?\u201d His smile\u2019s wicked curve played on her. From herstays to her drawers, everything was too tight, toomuch against her skin. Cyrus reached for her handworking his neck muscles.

  "Without entering here into a dissertation upon the historical romance, it may be said that in proper hands it has been and should continue to be one of the most valued and valuable expressions of the literary art. To render and maintain it so, however, it is necessary that certain well-defined limits should be set upon the licence which its writers are to enjoy; it is necessary that the work should be honest work; that preparation for it should be made by a sound, painstaking study of the period to be represented, to the end that a true impression may first be formed and then conveyed. Thus, considering how much more far-reaching is the novel than any other form of literature, the good results that must wait upon such endeavours are beyond question. The neglect of them\u2014the distortion of character to suit the romancer's ends, the like distortion of historical facts, the gross anachronisms arising out of a lack of study, have done much to bring the historical romance into disrepute.": "Rafael",

But revolutions are made by fanatical men of action with one-track mind, geniuses in their ability to confine themselves to a limited field. They overturn the old order in a few hours or days, the whole upheaval takes a few weeks or at most years, but the fanatical spirit that inspired the upheavals is worshiped for decades thereafter, for centuries.
