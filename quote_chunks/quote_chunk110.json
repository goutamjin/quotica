  "My mom used to get arrested for being with my dad. She would get fined. She would spend weekends in jail.": "Trevor",
  "I grew up in a working class family. People thought I might go work at a mill. My mom wanted me to learn how to lay carpet because she was concerned about my future. Nobody had high hopes for me. But I was a hustler.": "Mark",

  "My mother used to tell me man gives the award, God gives the reward. I don't need another plaque.": "Denzel",
  "Well I was eight years old, and I have an older cousin who is three years older than me and she was doing acting, commercials, and modeling at the time and... to see my cousin doing that was really inspiring and I wanted to do it. So I went to my mom and I asked her if I could do it, and for the acting part of it, she made me study for a year.": "Hailee",
  "When your mother asks, 'Do you want a piece of advice?' it is a mere formality. It doesn't matter if you answer yes or no. You're going to get it anyway.": "Erma",

  "Clearly, society has a tremendous stake in insisting on a woman's natural fitness for the career of mother: the alternatives are all too expensive.": "Ann",
  "Motherhood is the only thing in my life that I've really known for sure is something I wanted to do.": "Cynthia",
  "I am blessed to have Mom and Dad.": "Kevin",
  "I'm very close with my family, so my mom is part of my entourage.": "Kid",
  "I didn't plan on being a single mom, but you have to deal with the cards you are dealt the best way you can.": "Tichina",
  "A guy is a lump like a doughnut. So, first you gotta get rid of all the stuff his mom did to him. And then you gotta get rid of all that macho crap that they pick up from beer commercials. And then there's my personal favorite, the male ego.": "Roseanne",
  "My Mom said she learned how to swim when someone took her out in the lake and threw her off the boat. I said, 'Mom, they weren't trying to teach you how to swim.'": "Paula",
  "My mom used to say that I became a fighter and a scrapper and a tough guy to protect who I am at my core.": "Vin",
  "Morality and its victim, the mother - what a terrible picture! Is there indeed anything more terrible, more criminal, than our glorified sacred function of motherhood?": "Emma",
  "Throughout my life, my mom has been the person that I've always looked up to.": "Mike",
  "We need somebody who's got the heart, the empathy, to recognize what it's like to be a young teenage mom, the empathy to understand what it's like to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old - and that's the criterion by which I'll be selecting my judges.": "Barack",
  "I don't think I would have been able to stick with it and been proud of who I am and be feminine out on the court. I think I would have folded to the peer pressure if I didn't have my mom to encourage me to be me and be proud of how tall I am.": "Lisa",
  "I do work too hard sometimes, but my mom is such an inspiration. She tells me to 'chill out' and not take things so seriously. She will say: 'Go and have a massage.'": "Josh",
  "I just live life. I grew up in a Christian family, but, you know, the way Mom brought me up is to, you know, do you, to always be yourself.": "Tyler,",
  "My mom raised me to be clean, so it's in my nature. I have two little girls, and I'm married, but we've got a nanny and a maid.": "Vanilla",
  "As I have gotten older, I am more of an independent woman, and my mom and I have our own lives, but we are still best friends and can be there for each other.": "Amanda",
  "Yes, Mother. I can see you are flawed. You have not hidden it. That is your greatest gift to me.": "Alice",
  "Of all the roles I've played, none has been as fulfilling as being a mother.": "Annette",
  "When you have a good mother and no father, God kind of sits in. It's not enough, but it helps.": "Dick",
  "Do you know what you call those who use towels and never wash them, eat meals and never do the dishes, sit in rooms they never clean, and are entertained till they drop? If you have just answered, 'A house guest,' you're wrong because I have just described my kids.": "Erma",
  "When motherhood becomes the fruit of a deep yearning, not the result of ignorance or accident, its children will become the foundation of a new race.": "Margaret",
  "I was always going to church with my mom, dad and sister. I was literally raised under the godly influence both at home and church. There was no alcohol and no smoking at our house. That was the way a Bowden was supposed to live. My dad always told me to represent the Bowden name in a respectful manner.": "Bobby",
  "I was labeled a troublemaker, my mom an unfit mother, and I was not welcome anywhere.": "Ryan",
  "My mom just wants to make sure that my heart is always in whatever I do and I'm in things for the right reasons.": "Kevin",
  "I love being a single mom. But it's definitely different when you're dating.": "Brooke",
  "I was a single mom that raised two bright, beautiful, and compassionate girls.": "Connie",
  "When you are getting ready to become a mom, being in love with someone just isn't enough. You need to think about whether he would be a good parent and raise your children with similar beliefs.": "Cindy",
  "For everything I do, I think about a 6-year-old girl and her mom that I saw at my concert last night. I think about what those two individuals would think if I were at a club last night. I never want to be arrested, and I never want to get a DUI, those are my moral values.": "Taylor",
  "Being the only man in the household with my mom definitely helped me grow up fast.": "LeBron",
  "I think my mom threatened to put me up for adoption a few times.": "Ivanka",
  "My mom was very strict when I was growing up. I could not talk to boys until I was 18. I had to study and work hard.": "Coco",
  "I want somebody like my mom. My mom is a very charitable woman. She's the sweetest woman in the world. I'm looking for the second sweetest woman in the world. I'm looking for honesty and a big heart.": "Jason",
  "My relationship with my mom is really the single most profound relationship that I've ever had in my life.": "Mindy",
  "My mom was always saying: 'Be whatever you want to be, but stick with it. Don't waver. Don't change who you are for anybody.'": "Miranda",
  "My mom was a diabetic. Her sister was a diabetic, so I was already a candidate.": "Angie",
  "You don't realize how hard it is to live on your own. But there's no mom to do your laundry, and make you dinner and to do things for you, and you don't think about little things like buying paper towels and salt.": "Emma",
  "When I was 19 years old, both of my parents died in the same year; my mom of cancer and my dad in a car accident. Through the next two or three years and a series of bad decisions - all my own, I might add - I ended up literally homeless, before that was even a word. I even slept occasionally under a pier on the Gulf Coast.": "Andy",
  "My mom used to tell me that the most valuable thing she owned was her library card. We were poor, but that's not what she was talking about. My mom knew that education opened doors and opened minds.": "Richard",
  "My father moved to Hawaii from Brooklyn and my mother came there as a child from the Philippines. They met at a show where my dad was playing percussion. My mom was a hula dancer.": "Bruno",
  "I like to work. The self-esteem and satisfaction that I get from working makes me a better person, which makes me a better mom.": "Cindy",
  "My mom always said, 'Marry someone smarter than yourself, Katee, because No. 1, you're not that smart. And No. 2, then you'll have smart babies.'": "Katee",
  "My mom is just so good with fashion! She always tells me what looks good, what doesn't look good, and she gives me great advice.": "G.",
  "I love babies, and I have my nephews that I love. I have a great mom and she has raised three kids, so if I take lessons from her, I think I'll be great. All my friends have little brothers or sisters.": "Jamie",
  "There was the time I bought three cars in the span of three or four weeks. It was crazy; it wasn't greedy. It was mine, my girl's, my mom's. I got Benzes for my ladies. But I felt crazy. You have to understand I come from a world where we're very modest. But that's not greedy. That's nice, right?": "J.",
  "Whenever something went wrong when I was young - if I had a pimple or if my hair broke - my mom would say, 'Sister mine, I'm going to make you some soup.' And I really thought the soup would make my pimple go away or my hair stronger.": "Maya",
  "I always speak so highly of my mom because she's my partner in crime, and none of this would be possible without her love and support. Always have to make time for Mom.": "Shemar",
  "For some people, home is family and their mom's house or their girl or whatever, and I have those experiences as well, but the biggest thing for me is Chicago.": "Patrick",
  "My mom often tells me to get married, but she gets it now that I don't want to. Like any other mom, she is worried, but she also understands the demands of my profession. I am blessed to have a family like this.": "Randeep",
  "I wanted to get into films, and my parents were against it. I convinced my mom, and finally she convinced my dad. My dad then felt, who best to launch his son than him? So he launched me, and here I am.": "Vijay",
  "My father was a soldier. He was a frogman in the special forces in Denmark before I was born, and always the reality of that inspired me. My mom is very left-wing, classic socialist, and she always talked about the solders as almost crazy, violent, sick people, and I want to confront that because its very judgmental, and I'm not sure it's true.": "Tobias",
  "I've never lived my life in the opinion of others. I believe I'm a good person. I believe I'm a good mom. But that's for my kids to decide, not for the world.": "Angelina",
  "My mom told me if I ever got a tattoo, she was going to take it off with a potato peeler.": "Jacob",
  "As others have recently suggested, the term 'gamer' is no longer useful as an identity because games are for everyone. These days, even my mom spends an inordinate amount of time gaming on her iPad. So I'll take a cue from my younger self and say I don't care about being a 'gamer,' but I sure do love video games.": "Anita",
  "My mom loved rock n' roll. My father hated it. We couldn't play it when he was around. He liked classical music and Duke Ellington.": "Patti",
  "I'm the only one in - of my siblings, my mom and my family - that hasn't been affected by Lyme disease. It's been really hard for me because I'm the only one that doesn't really understand it.": "Gigi",
  "What I'm interested in is how your career choices can affect your private life, romantically or with your mom, your relatives, your friends, your hometown, and how media manipulates information - not newspapers or blogs, but the magazines that people impulse-buy that tell you what's hot and who's not.": "Xavier",
  "My dad and my mom convinced me to go into biomedical engineering because they said astronauts going to Mars will need life support systems.": "Rony",
  "My mom is awesome. She's really young. My mom is 40, and she raised me listening to Nirvana and Courtney Love and Coldplay, Gin Blossoms, The Cranberries, and stuff. Like, my early, early memories are of being a little kid running around in floral skirts and Doc Martens when I was, like, three.": "Halsey",
  "You've got to know how to hustle. I got a lot of inspiration from my parents. My father was definitely a hustler. With six kids in the house, you always got to be hustling. And my mom, she's got sick work ethic.": "Jay",
  "I'm very boring. I'm a mom. I'm 34 years old.": "Britney",
  "My mom and my dad was the best example of unconditional love I could see as a kid. I've known it my whole life. Interactions, kissing, hugging - it definitely wasn't the fake love.": "BJ",
  "My mom thought I could dance because I used to dance to this Janet Jackson song she'd play when I was a baby. Then she would take me to a Saturday dance school. I used to go every week and got spotted by a scout, who suggested I audition for the role of Billy in 'Billy Elliot the Musical.'": "Tom",
  "Mom spent the time that she was supposed to be a kid actully raising children, her younger brother and younger sister. She was tough as nails and did not suffer fools at all. And the truth was she could not afford to. She spoke the truth, bluntly, directly, and without much varnish. I am her son.": "Chris",
  "I'm sure there were times when I wish I had thought, 'Gosh, that might really embarrass mom and dad,' but our parents didn't raise us to think about them. They're very selfless and they wanted us to have as normal of a college life as possible. So really, we didn't think of any repercussions.": "Jenna",
  "My mom and my dad wanted my brother and I to have a better life, you know, better education, better jobs. It was probably harder, much, much harder, for my parents. When you're a kid, you can learn a language much more easily; I learned English in less than a year.": "Mila",
  "Being a mom makes me feel whole and like I understand the meaning of life.": "Rebecca",
  "I love getting my nails done. My mom's best friend is a manicurist. When I was little, she'd do little paintings on my nails, like flowers.": "Miranda",
  "My mom says: 'Why aren't you a doctor?' and I'm like, 'I am a doctor!' and she's all, 'No, I mean a real doctor.' She reads my books, but she says they give her a headache.": "Brian",
  "As a mom, you worry about protecting your kid. But there are extra added layers of fears when you're talking about a kid with autism or who has some special needs issue.": "Holly",
  "You need your mom and dad to protect you. It means they love you so much.": "Gabby",
  "Work used to be the No. 1 important thing to me. Everything revolved around it, and to have a new perspective and have something else, my family, not just being a mom but being a part of an incredible family of my own, it makes me have a different perspective on life that I think is richer.": "Lindsay",
  "I think 'Actions speak louder than words' is one thing, I think, I always took from my mom. And to this day, I think about that in everything I do.": "Ginni",
  "Boxing is individual, although there's a team concept because you need a great corner, you need a great trainer, you need a great prep man, you need all of these things, but it's more of a Mano a Mano; it's more you versus me. I miss that time in training camp and Dad and Mom cooking meals. It was one big family.": "Sugar",
  "My mom broke the mold. She put my brother and I first, always, and worked her fingers to the bone trying to provide for us. She taught us right from wrong and gave us very strong morals and values and belief in family, things that have stayed with me.": "Tim",
  "When I eat, I have to chop up everything on the plate and stir it all together. It devastates my mom. Everyone at the table is like, 'That looks like cat vomit.' And I stir my Coke with a spoon until it's flat.": "Margot",
  "I think the reason I'm a writer is because first, I was a reader. I loved to read. I read a lot of adventure stories and mystery books, and I have wonderful memories of my mom reading picture books aloud to me. I learned that words are powerful.": "Andrew",
  "My earliest memory is my mom picking me up after I had fallen down, giving me a big hug and reading me 'Goodnight Moon.' From that moment, to this one, every single memory I have of my mom is that regardless of what was happening in her life, she was always, always there for me.": "Chelsea",
  "My mom got 11 kids. We struggled.": "Young",
  "My mom always taught me - you know, little boys listen to their moms too much - that whatever you put into something is what you're going to get out of it.": "Jay-Z",
  "My jewelry's all fake - from Claire's. Or I get it from my mom's boutique in Barbados.": "Rihanna",
  "Definitely there are lots of days that l am really tired, especially after becoming a new mom. There's nothing more exhausting because physically, mentally, emotionally, it requires you to be on all the time.": "Jenna",
  "I did my first professional play at 11, and there was really nothing else I ever dreamed of doing. I felt so fortunate that I knew at the age of like, 12, like this is all I want to do for the rest of my life; that's the only play. There's no backup plan. My mom wanted me to go to school and have a backup plan. I'm like 'No, this is the only plan.'": "Eric",
  "My mom had early rap records, like Jimmy Spicer. In the middle of the records was a turntable and a receiver - I used to scratch records on it - and on top was a reel-to-reel. In front of that wall were more stacks of records. It was either Mom's record or Pop's record, and they had their names on each and every one.": "Jay-Z",
  "I fell in love with stories watching a British television puppet show called 'Thunderbirds' when it first came out on TV, about 1965, so I would have been 4 or 5 years old. I went out into the garden at my mom and dad's house, and I used to play with my little dinky toys, little cars and trucks and things.": "Peter",
  "At the end of the day, I'm Violet's mom, and I want the best for her.": "Christina",
  "Violet speaks Spanish and understands it. She loves Cuban food! My mom is very good at teaching her about our culture, whether it be the food or Spanish or explaining to her that she's Cuban.": "Christina",
  "My mom always told me I could do or be anything I dared to dream, and I always wanted to work in the movie industry.": "Octavia",
  "The first thing I do when I'm shopping is touch everything to see if it's itchy. I remember my mom used to put me in the itchiest clothes ever, and I was traumatized by it, so I won't wear anything itchy now.": "Kourtney",
  "When I was 15, my mom and I packed everything up and moved to Nashville so I could pursue my dream in music.": "Kelsea",
  "My parents told me from the time I can remember that, 'Yeah, you're adopted. But this is your family.' I can remember my mom, she tells me this story: when I was little, I was looking at her, and I was like, 'Why isn't my skin the same color as yours?' She was like, 'Oh, you're adopted, but I wish I had pretty brown skin like you.'": "Colin",
  "Once you're a mom, always a mom. It's like riding a bike, you never forget.": "Taraji",
  "Statistics are to baseball what a flaky crust is to Mom's apple pie.": "Harry",
  "I think it's a tough road if you're a stay-at-home mom, a working mom, if you have a partner, if you don't. It's the best job in the world, and the toughest job in the world all at the same time.": "Angela",
  "I want to thank my mom, Brenda Rose. My heart, the reason I play the way I play, just everything. Just knowing the days I don't feel right, going to practice, having a hard time, I think about her when she had to wake me up, go to work and make sure I was all right. Those were hard days.": "Derrick",
  "My mom was a free spirit, and she brought me up to be a free spirit.": "Mark",
  "My parents couldn't give me a whole lot of financial support, but they gave me good genes. My dad is a handsome son-of-a-gun, and my mom is beautiful. And I've definitely been the lucky recipient. So, thank you, Mom and Dad.": "Ashton",
  "My guess is my brother would call his mom and his dad pretty regularly, a lot more than I probably did.": "Jeb",
  "My mom used to call me a parrot, because the way I spoke would change in every country we'd go to.": "Hannah",

  "Who in their infinite wisdom decreed that Little League uniforms be white? Certainly not a mother.": "Erma",
  "I remember my mom threatening me, half-serious: 'You know what? I should take you to Pittsburgh and put you in dance lessons just to keep you occupied.' Well, that brought everything to a screeching halt. 'Jeeze, dance lessons.' In retrospect, it would have been awesome, but then, 'Ugh, dancing - dancing's for sissies.'": "Michael",
  "For the first few years of my life my mom used to cut my hair so there were a lot of bowl-cut hair styles.": "Ne-Yo",
  "One-year-olds learn concealment. Five-year-olds lie outright: they manipulate via flattery. Nine-year-olds - masters of the cover-up. By the time you enter college, you're going to lie to your mom in one out of every five interactions.": "Pamela",
  "Minimalism? It is something I appreciate as an art form but leave to others - unless you count a collection of warhorse-workwear Yves Saint Laurent trouser suits. Maybe my penchant for hippie-deluxe eccentricity came from an escapist dream of a different world. It was tough being a working mom in the 1970s.": "Suzy",
  "My mom has always wished me a daughter just like me.": "Pink",
  "Mothers are fonder than fathers of their children because they are more certain they are their own.": "Aristotle",
  "Toronto is a special city, and the environment is perfect for the arts; free and alive. I'm a New Yorker, and Toronto reminds me of a much cleaner New York, so it's like coming home after your mom just cleaned your room for you; for me that's a lovely environment.": "Emory",
  "My mom didn't want us to go to the candy house, she didn't want us to go to the ice cream truck, she didn't want us to go to the... There was actually a donut truck, if that makes sense.": "Venus",
  "The mother-child relationship is paradoxical and, in a sense, tragic. It requires the most intense love on the mother's side, yet this very love must help the child grow away from the mother, and to become fully independent.": "Erich",
  "When I get high anxiety, I vomit. My mom was so stressed out. Then I found out I was staying in John Mayer's old dorm room, and I had a nice roommate. That completely brought me down. I was completely comfortable at Berklee.": "Charlie",
  "Motherhood has a very humanizing effect. Everything gets reduced to essentials.": "Meryl",
  "The fastest way to break the cycle of perfectionism and become a fearless mother is to give up the idea of doing it perfectly - indeed to embrace uncertainty and imperfection.": "Arianna",
  "Motherhood is priced Of God, at price no man may dare To lessen or misunderstand.": "Helen",
  "Dad's Jewish and Irish, Mom's German and Scotch. I couldn't say I was anything. My last name isn't even Downey. My dad changed his name when he wanted to get into the Army and was underage. My real name is Robert Elias. I feel like I'm still looking for a home in some way.": "Robert",
  "My mom, she wasn't like a baseball mother who knew everything about the game. She just wanted me to be happy with what I was doing.": "David",
  "What makes me happy is just curling up in with my mom in her bed and watching a marathon of 'CSI' and 'Grey's Anatomy' episodes with pints of ice cream.": "Taylor",
  "A lot of times when people become successful, people don't really understand what they had to do or the sacrifices they made to do that, or they assume that they had money. This is coming from, like, a kid who was broke and lived with roaches and a single mom in Dorchester.": "Clinton",
  "A father may turn his back on his child, brothers and sisters may become inveterate enemies, husbands may desert their wives, wives their husbands. But a mother's love endures through all.": "Washington",
  "Sunscreen is my number 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 tip. I'm a fanatic, partially because I live in L.A. and have fair skin and freckles, and partially because of my kids. My mom always made me wear sunscreen and I'm trying to be that mom for them.": "Alison",
  "My mom didn't ever think I would take to acting because I was a very shy, very reserved kind of child. But obviously, something changed!": "Abigail",
  "The best part about playing a mom is that people hug moms. I get hugs all the time. It really makes hard days a lot easier, and easy days are downright joyous.": "Kim",
  "If I could get any animal it would be a dolphin. I want one so bad. Me and my mom went swimming with dolphins and I was like, 'How do we get one of those?' and she was like, 'You can't get a dolphin. What are you gonna do, like, put it in your pool?'": "Miley",
  "When I was 7, an old lady was driving too fast in my neighborhood and hit me with her car. I was running out of the house, and when I got halfway into the street, my mom saw the car and yelled for me to run back. As I turned around the car hit me, dragged me five houses down the road, and I fractured my collarbone.": "Rutina",

  "My mom was a terrible parent of young children. And thank God - I thank God every time I think of it - I was sent to my paternal grandmother. Ah, but my mother was a great parent of a young adult.": "Maya",
  "What motivated me? My mother. My mother was an immigrant woman, a peasant woman, struggled all her life, worked in the garment center.": "Al",
  "I hear my friends and my mom tell me I'm special, but honestly, I still don't get it.": "LeBron",
  "It's about getting the kids up and fed, getting one to school, getting the other down for a nap, going to the grocery store, picking one up from school, getting the other one down for another nap, cooking dinner... I live my life at these two extremes. I'm either a full-time stay-at-home mom or a full-time actress.": "Jennifer",
  "My mom used to take me down to the Jersey Shore when I was 7, 8, 9 years old. I can remember being down in that area - Belmar, Seaside Heights, Asbury Park and all those places that I went back and revisited.": "David",
  "My mom was concerned that us four little black girls have a really well-balanced life. She wanted us to be around people like us, but we also went to private school and traveled all the time. Now I fit in most places because I've been most places.": "Kelis",
  "My mom, she's a great cook. You know, pirogue, borscht. I love borscht, and I love Pilemeni, meat dumplings.": "Irina",
  "Mom and Pop were just a couple of kids when they got married. He was eighteen, she was sixteen and I was three.": "Billie",
  "My mom was sarcastic about men. She would tell me Adam was the rough draft and Eve was the final product. She was a feminist minister, an earth mom who wore a bra only on Sundays.": "Daphne",
  "I grabbed my mom and I went to the couch and I said, 'Mom I want to ask Jesus to come into my heart.' And I got on my knee and I asked Jesus to come into my heart, forgive me of my sins, and make me a child of God.": "Tim",
  "Our parents are obviously proud, but they're still trying to get used to the fact that we're in a band. I have a feeling my mom would actually like One Direction if I wasn't in it!": "Zayn",
  "I'm kind of lucky that we've finished shooting 'Cougar Town,' so I'm able to kind of just enjoy my pregnancy and be a stay-at-home mom and go to prenatal Pilates and do all that fun stuff that, if I were working, would be almost impossible to do.": "Busy",
  "Did Superman really want to save the world, or did he just feel like he had to? Would he much rather be a farmer? Maybe. Would he much rather be hanging out with his dad and his mom and his dog? Probably.": "Gerard",
  "I'm too young to have kids, but I really want to be a mom. I don't know if it's a Latin thing, but I love kids.": "Alice",
  "I'm raised by a single mom and didn't have pops around for the most part of my life. And she, by any means necessary, gave me the best opportunities that she knew how to give me.": "Shemar",
  "My mother wouldn't allow me to speak slang when I was growing up. But when I got outside, around my friends, it was 'Yo' and 'That's the joint' and 'Yo, what's up?' So I had my game for my friends and my game for my mom.": "Queen",
  "It was tough being a single mom. It was tough being in a divorce with children. Very, very hard.": "Melissa",
  "What I will not do is continue to perpetuate stereotypes. I'm the daughter of a maid why do I have to also play a maid? My mom was a maid so I didn't have to be a maid. ": "Gina",
  "I'm not sure how young kids get to the point where they're memorizing and knowing songs, but I knew the words to 'Missing You' from John Waite probably from when I was three years old. For whatever reason, that was the song that I gravitated toward when it was on the radio and I was driving around with my mom.": "Brandon",
  "I lead by example. My kids know what sweat is. They've seen me come home from so many runs and asked, 'What's on your skin? How did you get it?' And I tell them, 'It's from exercise!' So now my son will come home from a bike ride, take off his helmet and say, 'Look, Mom. I'm sweating! I just worked out!'": "Summer",
  "Privacy is relational. It depends on the audience. You don't want your employer to know you're job hunting. You don't spill all about your love life to your mom or your kids. You don't tell trade secrets to your rivals.": "Barton",
  "My mom has a rare talent for being able to open up the refrigerator, and with the peas, the leftover eggs, the cream, the spinach, the cheese, and a little rice, she can just whip up incredible risotto.": "Cote",
  "When my first semester grades came out, my mom and dad told me I wouldn't be playing football.": "Joe",
  "I think I grew up with a profound sense of watching people who were good people, who were smart people, who were hardworking people - God, nobody on this Earth worked harder than my mom and dad - and they had very little.": "Elizabeth",
  "I like a bohemian floral dress, but then I'll throw on a leather jacket or a pair of lace-up boots to give it an edge. My mom is always trying to get me to wear really sweet clothes. Something pink. But that's not really my look.": "Margaret",
  "My mom is a wonderful woman. She's always been an inspiration to me, but having kids helped me make even more sense of my relationship with her.": "Britney",
  "My grandparents and my mom prayed the rosary a lot, and later in life, I had a priest friend of mine teach me centering prayer, based on Father Thomas Keating's work. That led to practicing different kinds of meditation off and on as I got older.": "Tim",
  "I'm always awoken with the joyous sound and laughter of my son. That's the best part about being a mom.": "Jane",
  "On Halloween, don't you know back when you were little, your mom tells you don't eat any candy until she checks it? I used to be so tempted to eat my candy on the way to other people's houses. That used to be such a tease.": "Derrick",
  "My mom said the only reason men are alive is for lawn care and vehicle maintenance.": "Tim",
  "I wasn't one to go out and buy a new car and stereo system and expensive clothes. My mom helped keep me grounded.": "Christina",

  "I basically became a cheerleader because I had a very strict mom. That was my way of being a bad girl.": "Sandra",
  "I sing seriously to my mom on the phone. To put her to sleep, I have to sing 'Maria' from West Side Story. When I hear her snoring, I hang up.": "Adam",
  "I'd lose my mind if I heard my kid call the nanny Mommy.": "Toni",

  "What do girls do who haven't any mothers to help them through their troubles?": "Louisa",
  "My mom taught us the Serenity Prayer at a young age.": "Toby",
  "I don't want to let my life as a woman pass me by. There's a time to work, there's a time to be young and crazy, and there should be a time to enjoy motherhood. I'm actually looking forward to that.": "Diane",
  "I always knew I wanted to have children. When I met my husband, Rande, I thought, 'This is the guy.' When you are getting ready to become a mom, being in love with someone just isn't enough. You need to think about whether he would be a good parent and raise your children with similar beliefs.": "Cindy",
  "Postpartum depression is a very real and very serious problem for many mothers. It can happen to a first time mom or a veteran mother. It can occur a few days... or a few months after childbirth.": "Richard",
  "I consider my mom and all my sisters my friends.": "Alexa",
  "I'm a just a mom when I walk down the street.": "Alice",
  "In fact, my mom always told me because I was the daughter of an Army officer born overseas in Paris, France, that under the Constitution she believed that I could never run for president.": "Karen",
  "I love playing moms. It's a lot easier than being a mom, I hear.": "Faith",
  "She hits me and she beats me and she drinks. My mom is an alcoholic.": "Tonya",
  "I probably have an earlier curfew than anyone. My mom wants to keep me really safe and my dad's not overly protective, but he's a dad no matter what.": "Miley",
  "My mom used to make everything. She had a great garden and composted and made everything from scratch - peanut butter, bread, jelly, everything. I don't know how she did it because all those things take time and love and labour. I only do half the stuff she does - but there's still time.": "Julia",
  "My mother was a single mom, and most of the women I know are strong.": "Regina",
  "Even in high school, I'd tell my mom I was sick of swimming and wanted to try to play golf. She wasn't too happy. She'd say, 'Think about this.' And I'd always end up getting back in the pool.": "Michael",
  "My mom still lives in Denver and some of my brothers are still in the area, so I still have strong ties there.": "Terrell",
  "I grew up painting and playing piano so when I was a little kid I thought I was going to be an artist or a painter but my mom had me taking piano lessons for about 10-12 years as a young kid.": "Mike",
  "In third grade, I was taking tap-dance lessons, and about six weeks before the recital I wanted to quit. My mom said, 'No, you're going to stay with it.' Well, I did it, and I was bad, too! But my parents never let their kids walk away from something because it was too hard.": "Rebecca",
  "As a mom I know that raising children is the hardest job there is.": "Hilary",
  "When I see my mom in the stands, it always pushes me to succeed.": "Ashton",
  "My whole life sort of ended when my mom died.": "Cheryl",
  "Country was about character. Country's changed because of monsters like Clear Channel who bought up all the stations and sliced them up into formats. Our demographic is now the soccer mom.": "Gary",
  "My mom was such a strong character. I don't want to say she was like a man, but she was tough.": "Lance",
  "I'm more straightforward, and I speak up more than I did before. When I was younger, I wouldn't speak up as much, but now that I'm a mom, things have changed.": "Britney",
  "My mom knows pretty well how I see her.": "Lena",
  "Two weeks ago at the U.S. Amateur, my mom caddied, and that is kind of a different feeling, because she's your mom and you have to listen to her. It was really comfortable having my mom there, but it's also really relieving and comfortable to have someone that knows the course off their hat, really.": "Lydia",
  "Being a singer is all about me. About ego. Being a mom is all about being selfless - two different worlds.": "Gwen",
  "My mom insisted on multigrain bread and never allowed soda in the house.": "Vin",
  "One of my most sentimental items is my grandmother's engagement ring that my mom gave me a few years ago. It's a Victorian-style setting that's closed in the back, so it doesn't sparkle the way diamonds do now. I wear it as a pendant.": "Georgina",
  "My mom calls me an older soul because, growing up, she taught me stuff real early. Now I spend most of my time chasing wisdom, chasing understanding.": "Ray",
  "When my dad was badly weakened by the flu and my mom wanted to call an ambulance to take him to the emergency room, he wouldn't go unless he could shave first and change into a nice shirt and a pair of slacks.": "Rich",
  "When I turned 18, my mom, my nana and I all went and had tattoos of our favorite Bible verses put on the inside of our wrists. Mine is 1st Timothy, 4:12.": "Jordin",
  "I think my first big purchase was actually for my mom. She had one of those '90s TVs in her living room that's like a 10x10 brick, so I purchased her a flatscreen for her living room.": "Dave",
  "My mom told me to do whatever I wanted to do and don't get too anxious about it.": "David",
  "For many women, going back to work a few months after having a baby is overwhelming and unmanageable. As strange as it may seem, things get even more difficult for a working mom after the second and third baby arrive. By that time, the romance of being a modern 'superwoman' wears off and reality sets in.": "Mika",
  "I am a single mom and I'm the breadwinner and I have to work and I have to do these things and that's just the way it is. I don't think my son even knows any different.": "Charisma",
  "Aretha Franklin was a teenage mom, a musician who came from an incredibly Christian background, but there was a lot of love, which is really inspiring in a feminist way.": "Beth",
  "I can't help but recall my dad and mom. Depression era kids, 8th and 9th grade educations, clawed and scratched to make a living as dairy farmers their whole life. At least two drought cycles nearly took it all away. They just worked harder, longer... and they made it.": "Bob",
  "My parents waited to have me and my sister - my dad was 43 when my mother had me, and my mom was 38. They purposefully waited until they had had their adventures in life so that we wouldn't represent the end of their freedom.": "Christian",
  "My mom worked as a pharmacist, but she is one of the best storytellers I know. My sister is a gospel and opera singer and my brother, who passed away, was a writer.": "Tunde",
  "My deceased grandmother on my mom's side was a real fairy godmother, who lived to be 102 and who I always feel is looking after me.": "Victoria",
  "I was brought up bilingual, but there came a point where my mom went back to work and I got a white babysitter, so sadly I lost it. Now I can understand Spanish and put words together, but I don't speak it fluently. I'm ashamed of that.": "Michael",
  "It's tough growing up where I grew up. My family is very small and really tight. Just being around the neighborhood, my brothers were always around. I didn't want to be in any trouble because I knew my mom or brothers would find out. I didn't want to hurt their feelings. I just tried to do everything right.": "Derrick",
  "You may earn whatever money you earn as a cricketer, but you want to play for your country. At the end of the day, you want to do something special. There are plenty of people who earn 50 crores or 100 crores as businessmen or big professionals or who are really doing well in business. But what gives pleasure to your mom and dad is the fame.": "Mahendra",
  "As an actress, I have put myself out there as an independent black woman, a single mom, a go-getter, a hustler who isn't afraid to survive.": "LisaRaye",
  "I don't remember my first trip, but I do remember when my mom took me to Disney World in Orlando. It wasn't the rides but Epcot Center that most fascinated me. It made me want to see those countries that are represented there for real.": "Lisa",
  "My mom was in education, and I remember reading in one of her books about multiple intelligences - this whole theory about how there are all these different ways you can be intelligent, like eight or 10 of them or something. And one of them is emotional.": "Lynn",
  "Before 'Lucky Louie,' nobody would ever cast me to play a mom or a wife; nobody ever saw me in that role, which is weird, since that's who I really am.": "Pamela",
  "One day I went up to my mom and I said, 'Mom, can I have permission to build a 2.3-million electron-volt atom smasher - a betatron - in the garage?' And my mom stared at me, and she said, 'Sure. Why not? And don't forget to take out the garbage.'": "Michio",
  "My mom and dad were actors when they were younger and had a horrible experience of it. My dad became a literary agent and my mom a casting director.": "Daniel",
  "My dad didn't graduate from high school, ended up being a printing salesman, probably never made more than $8,000 a year. My mom sold real estate and did it part time.": "Al",
  "Bakers get excited over aprons. I love the soft cotton ones with pockets like my gramma and mom wore. They always kept a hankie tucked in one pocket, which wasn't sanitary, but was comforting to the child who needed a tear or nose wiped.": "Regina",
  "I remember one time when all the nuns in my Catholic grade school got around in a semicircle, me and Mom in the middle, and they said, 'Mrs. Farley, the children at school are laughing at Christopher, not with him.' I thought, 'Who cares? As long as they're laughing.'": "Chris",
  "I knew that I was a gay boy fairly early; what was interesting to me was that my mother didn't know. She made me play baseball - I had no desire to do that. I said, 'Mom, I don't like direct sunlight, I don't like bugs, I don't like grass, and I'd rather be in the house playing with your fabric samples.'": "Nate",
  "My mom is a really good cook. We used to make dumplings together.": "Jason",
  "My mom means the world to me. She's always been the one to get me up early for work, help me with my make up and hair, and just be there to support me in whatever I do. She always makes sure that no matter what, I'm happy in what I'm doing.": "Raini",
  "My mom really inspired me. She has always taught me it's not about us, it's about what we can give back.": "Bailee",
  "I've got three sisters, five aunties, and my mom. It must have had an influence on me growing up.": "Zayn",
  "I think maybe my mom thought that Katharine Hepburn would be a good role model of, like, a strong, smart, independent woman. Maybe she steered me in that direction. You know, because she was really so ahead of her time.": "Gillian",
  "When you can impress your mom by saying you've been to someone's concert, you know you're pretty lame.": "Gillian",
  "After I graduated high school and came out to do 'Buffy,' I was enrolled at my mom's university, and I was going to go get a real job. I never thought of acting and never really wanted to be an actor.": "Eliza",
  "I don't have a creepy uncle, but I certainly have many, many uncles. My mom has twelve brothers and sisters, and my dad has two sisters and three brothers. Their maturity level is still hovering around fifteen when they all get together, but they're not necessarily creepy.": "Martha",
  "You know, I only claim to play three instruments. My dad is a banker, but a drummer at heart; and my mom used to teach piano lessons when she was younger. So I can play some piano, play a little drums, and fake the bass - but banjo, mandolin, and guitar are my thing.": "Charlie",
  "My mom has beautiful eyes, and I inherited a lot of her rituals, accentuating eyes.": "Allison",
  "My mother never said to lose weight. Diets were never a big deal. My mom was always beautiful and voluptuous and curvy, and I always thought she was gorgeous.": "Christina",
  "It's not about being rich, but everyone back home has a pool. And I was a total water baby. My mom couldn't get me out - she'd put my dinner plate at the end of the pool, and I'd eat my meals in the water.": "Margot",
  "People may not know this about me, but I've always loved cooking. My favorite thing to cook is my mom's spicy spaghetti.": "Becky",
  "That's the Indian in me - you must put spices on everything. As a kid, whenever we got sick, my mom would take milk and put turmeric in it. That was our medicine. That was the cure-all. Some people turn to Robitussin.": "Aasif",
  "It's not like I'm out eating McDonald's and Del Taco every night. I eat good: my mom fixes dinner every single night - baked chicken, fish - she cooks a great meal every single night.": "Bryce",
  "I used to read music books when I was 13. My mom was working at a library. She's a librarian. I would get my mom to check out any kind of books that had anything to do with the music industry. I read a lot about royalities, publishing, marketing, stuff like that.": "Juicy",
  "My mom sent me money for a car, but the cops impounded it because I had no insurance.": "Martin",
  "My mom always taught me to put toothpaste on pimples to dry them out at night. I do that all the time. I don't use anything fancy when I get a pimple. And I never use the same toothpaste for long because I get bored. So I'll do peppermint and then one month I'll do cinnamon. I'm creative.": "Gigi",
  "When I come to visit my mom - every two or three months - I generally spend five or six hours with her each day. She's always immensely glad to see me, her eldest child, her only son.": "Michael",
  "It's been a lot of fun getting to work with Tracy Middendorf, who plays my mom. As an actor, it's always fun to have different parents and to create different familial dynamics than you have in your real life.": "Willa",
  "You really don't need to study how to change a diaper. As a new mom, you learn pretty darn quickly!": "Ivanka",
  "I was raised vegan. My mom would always make quinoa with squash and kale, hippie stuff like that. Now I eat meat, but I try to be conscious about where it's coming from.": "Zoe",
  "My mom and I have always been very close since she did raise me as, like, a single mom. My friends and everyone I know are like, 'Wow, you guys really have a really good relationship.' She's with me a lot of the time, so people find that kind of shocking.": "Tiffany",
  "My mom's best friend growing up was diagnosed with AIDS, and he basically raised me when my mom was launching her business. Although I didn't understand at the time what HIV or AIDS was, I knew that's what he passed away from.": "Solange",
  "When I was 13, I would come visit my aunt and uncle in New York. I decided I wanted to live with them after seeing my cousin's school. Honestly, I just wanted to go to a school where I didn't have to wear uniforms, and my mom said okay.": "Priyanka",
  "Having children is not for everyone, but I think it's a beautiful lesson in it not being all about me anymore. It's a relief, in a way. It's like, this is her story now, and I'm her mom. It's a nice shift.": "Lake",
  "My mom is incredibly stylish, and she gets it from my grandmother. I feel like I can't live up to how chic they are as women. They are great role models for aging gracefully, and that's a thing that is very key that I try to always emulate.": "Lake",
  "My parents know I was outgoing as a child, and whenever people came over, I'd automatically do impressions of them as soon as they left; it was my mom's favorite thing. Yes, I grew up in Hollywood, but not in any rich neighborhood.": "Leonardo",
  "My mom, Nellie, got me a rosary at church. I don't use it to pray before a competition. I'll just pray normally to myself, but I have it there in case.": "Simone",
  "I had a lot of energy, and my mom decided to look for a place where I can spend the energy, because I was jumping on the couch and furniture, and I was jumping on the top of the things in the house.": "Nadia",
  "At a show, I'll look out from the stage and see a woman with a pearl necklace next to a guy in a Grateful Dead T-shirt next to a young kid with his mom. It's fun to see them all together.": "Hiromi",
  "It was the late '70s when my parents met. My dad was a lighting director for a soap opera, and my mom was a temp at the studio. They moved into a house in The Valley in L.A., to a neighborhood that was leafy and affordable.": "Meghan",
  "At the start of each week, I generally cook a box of quinoa, and while it's simmering, I saute onions, garlic and any veggies I have on hand in a separate pan. I season the vegetables with Spike, a seasoning blend my mom always used when I was growing up, or a little Bragg Liquid Aminos. I always add crushed red pepper and chopped fresh herbs.": "Meghan",
  "I'm like every waitress in every diner I'm like every mom driving her kids to school. I'm nothing special at all. ": "Katherine",
  "Dad told me that before I was born, he would put my mom's stomach up to the speaker and play Led Zeppelin.": "Thomas",
  "I like superheroes who are very human and underdog. That's why I relate to my character in 'A Flying Jatt': because he is a very normal person and very human. He was very unsure about his super powers; he didn't know how to use them. He is scared of heights, speed. Especially he is scared of his mom, but he has to listen to her.": "Tiger",
  "There was always an unspoken generosity about my mom.": "Matt",
  "I didn't grow up with a lot of money, so my mom didn't have random money to buy me a car, and I didn't have money to have a car unless I worked, so I didn't get a car until I got my first job at 18.": "Dominick",
  "My dad and mom were in bands: the Soda Jerks, Fat Time, Girls at Play - which is a play on Men at Work.": "Sia",
  "My mom named me Pom because she said it sounded like a combination of Korean words that mean 'spring' and 'tiger.' So, it's very unique!": "Pom",
  "It was so weird that I would end up directing 'The Greatest Game Ever Played,' because, y'know, I'm not a big golfer myself. But I grew up around the game. My mom and dad kind of built their dream house off the 11th fairway of Shady Oaks Country Club in Fort Worth.": "Bill",
  "Marvin Gaye is an inspiration to me. He was one of the first Motown musicians that my mom and dad introduced me to, and I always thought it would be a good idea if I was ever an artist, and now I am, to make a record called 'Marvin Gaye.'": "Charlie",
  "I didn't understand that I could sing until I was like 11 or 12. My mom heard me singing around the house and she said, What are you doing? You really can sing! So then I started going to school and singing to the girls.": "Chris",
  "My mom is going to kill me for talking about sleeping with people. But I don't want to put myself in the position where I'm in a monogamous relationship right now. I'm not dating just one person. 'Sex and the City' changed everything for me because those girls would sleep with so many people.": "Lindsay",
  "I care so passionately about improving the quality of life for women and girls, not just here in the United States, but internationally as well. I am a single mom and I raised a daughter who is now a young adult.": "Valerie",
  "We were poor. But my mom never accepted that. She worked hard to become a residential contractor - got her master's with honors at the University of New Orleans. I used to go to every class with her. Her father was my paternal figure.": "Frank",
  "There's been times when I've had heartbreaking moments and I'm like, 'I can't believe you said that,' or 'I can't believe you did that'. And it hurts, it still hurts, and it'll always hurt, but I've never had somebody that I truly cared about just walk out on me, whether it was a boyfriend, or an aunt, mom or dad.": "Shailene",
  "My mom and dad passed away from cancer. Within nine months, I lost both of my folks. Immediately after that, I had a horrible betrayal where my brother, who worked for me, stole a lot of my money. He's in jail now.": "Dane",
  "Mom's dad was in the army, stormed the beach at Normandy, fought through the French hedgerows, the Battle of the Ardennes, the Battle of the Bulge, and liberated concentration camps at the end of the war.": "Mark",
  "I promised my mom that if, after a year of putting 150 percent into my career it didn't work out, I would go back to school. I never did go back.": "Queen",
  "I warm up with my mom and make sure I understand what the songs are about and make sure I'm using the right technique. To be honest with you, I really don't practice a lot... Usually, I say a prayer and ask the Lord to sing with me and help me and stand on the stage with me.": "Jackie",
  "My mom is big on moisturizer and water. She always reminds me to drink a lot of water and wear sunglasses because I always forget them when I go out, even though they are one of my favorite accessories. She always reminds me about wrinkles, and always did, so it's kind of been ingrained into me.": "Brittany",
  "People still ask my husband and me which of us is the mom - which, as one lesbian friend pointed out to me, is like asking which chopstick is the fork. This pressure on us to embody normative traditions can be paralysing.": "Andrew",
  "I am so blessed. I have an incredible wife, children I adore; I'm a very happy man. I've got a great mom and dad and brothers and sisters and stuff, so I've always been happy. And I never stop smiling.": "Michael",
  "I'm a real stay-at-home mom. I'm really hands-on. Everything else became secondary.": "Drew",
  "I grew up in Marcy Projects in Brooklyn, and my mom and pop had an extensive record collection, so Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder and all of those sounds and souls of Motown filled the house.": "Jay-Z",
  "Having a mom as a hairdresser was really awesome: I was always her test dummy. I've had every style, every color you could imagine.": "Alessia",
  "I know a lot of people who really aren't beautiful because their attitudes are very nasty... Whether I make the 50 most beautiful list or not, I'm always going to feel like I'm number one most beautiful to myself... I get that from my mom, and my daddy and my friends who raised me.": "Queen",
  "I read that John Hughes script for 'Mr. Mom,' and I thought, 'This guy is a funny writer.' I went: 'You ought to stick around and direct this thing.' But he didn't; he left, and look what he became. A really legendary comedy director.": "Michael",
  "My mom had Julia Child and 'The Fannie Farmer Cookbook' on top of the refrigerator, and she had a small repertoire of French dishes.": "Anthony",
  "I've always wanted to be sure my parents approve of what I do. Even with my tattoos, my mom went with me.": "Ashley",
  "There was never a child so lovely but his mother was glad to get him to sleep.": "Ralph",
  "My mom and my dad were both very sociable, meeting lots of interesting people.": "Bill",
  "My mom was on the United Way group that decides how to allocate the money and looks at all the different charities and makes the very hard decisions about where that pool of funds is going to go.": "Bill",
  "My dad died when I was young; my mom remarried with more haste than sense to a fellow... he wasn't evil or anything, but he was worthless.": "P.",
  "I'm too tough and sensitive to have to have some pubescent twerp with his mom's earring in his tongue, who combs his hair with Redi-Whip and has an Ani DiFranco tattoo on his shin, come show me how a computer works.": "P.",
  "I just wasn't cut out to be a Chinese Tiger Mom. I'm more of an Irish Setter Dad.": "P.",
  "When my mom ran for the Senate, my dad was there for her every step of the way. I can still hear her saying in her beautiful voice, 'Why should women have any less say than men, about the great decisions facing our nation?'": "Mitt",
  "I love my dad. It's fair to say that I probably would not have thought of politics had I not seen my mom and dad involved in politics.": "Mitt",
  "My guess is that my mom and dad are very actively involved in the affairs of the next life, and they don't spend too much time looking back. My dad used to say he always looks forward; he never looks back.": "Mitt",
  "My mom and I have always been really close. She's always been the friend that was always there. There were times when, in middle school and junior high, I didn't have a lot of friends. But my mom was always my friend. Always.": "Taylor",
  "When I was younger we had a grape arbor, and my mom would go out and pick grapes and make grape jam in the sink - boil it, put it in jars, and give it away as gifts.": "Taylor",
  "I've been my mom's kitchen helper since I was a little kid.": "Taylor",
  "I once went on the most grueling radio tour. Living in hotel rooms, sleeping in the backs of rental cars as my mom drove to three different cities in one day.": "Taylor",
  "My question about luging is, How do you get into the luge community to begin with? Is it one day like, 'Mom, Dad, I really want to luge.' And your parents are like: 'O.K., I'll quit my job. We'll move to an Alpine community.'": "Douglas",
  "My dad was a bartender. My mom was a cashier, a maid and a stock clerk at K-Mart. They never made it big. They were never rich. And yet they were successful. Because just a few decades removed from hopelessness, they made possible for us all the things that had been impossible for them.": "Marco",
  "My parents were working class folks. My dad was a bartender for most of his life, my mom was a maid and a cashier and a stock clerk at WalMart. We were not people of financial means in terms of significant financial means. I always told them, 'I didn't always have what I wanted. I always had what I needed.' My parents always provided that.": "Marco",
  "It wasn't so long ago that I was a working mom myself. And I know that sometimes, much as we all hate to admit it, it's just easier to park the kids in front of the TV for a few hours, so we can pay the bills or do the laundry or just have some peace and quiet for a change.": "Michelle",
  "As a mom, I know it is my responsibility, and no one else's, to raise my kids. But we have to ask ourselves, what does it mean when so many parents are finding their best efforts undermined by an avalanche of advertisements aimed at our kids.": "Michelle",
  "Our life before moving to Washington was filled with simple joys... Saturdays at soccer games, Sundays at grandma's house... and a date night for Barack and me was either dinner or a movie, because as an exhausted mom, I couldn't stay awake for both.": "Michelle",
  "My dad was an autoworker, my mom was a clerk. Until I was thirty-five, I never made more than fifteen thousand dollars a year.": "Michael",
  "All the awards in the world, you can get into all the nightclubs, they'll send you the nicest clothes. Nothing better than walking into your dad's restaurant and seeing a smile on his face and knowing that your mom and dad and your sister are real proud of you.": "Lady",
  "My mom and I are very close.": "Lady",
  "No press, no television. If my mom calls and says, 'Did you hear about?' I don't want to know nothing about anything that is going on in relation to music. I shut it all off.": "Lady",
  "When I was a kid, there were no credit cards. Instead, retailers offered layaway plans. My mom would go to a store, such as a furniture outlet, choose the sofa she wanted, and put it on layaway. That meant she put a little money down to hold the sofa, and every payday she'd pay a little toward the purchase.": "Robert",
  "My mom loved rock 'n roll. My father hated it. We couldn't play it when he was around.": "Patti",
  "I'm a human being, I'm a friend, I'm a mom, I'm a writer, and I'm an artist. I do play electric guitar and all of that, but in the end, I'm just a person.": "Patti",
  "I think my love of journalizing my life comes from my mom.": "Jeff",
  "My mom wasn't a movie star.": "Jeff",
  "When I was really young, my mom enrolled me in dance classes.": "Jeff",
  "How simple a thing it seems to me that to know ourselves as we are, we must know our mothers names.": "Alice",
  "My parents met because my father was an actor friend of one of my mom's brothers, but my mother has never set foot on the stage - she's quite shy. So it's a strange thing because people say, 'Oh, coming from acting parents,' when the idea of acting would literally make my mother just want to throw up.": "Kate",
  "My mom had very low expectations for me, and she really had a point. I was a big problem at seventeen. If I had a kid like me, I would have those same expectations.": "Alejandro",
  "I can honestly say, after talking about my mom passing away, I got the biggest weight off of my chest. Comedy is my therapy. That's how I deal with my problems, my personal battles. I talk about it. I give it to my fans. When they laugh at it, it's a release, for lack of a better word.": "Kevin",
  "My mom was very strict. She didn't let me watch anything rated R or anything with cussing.": "Kevin",
  "Being in Australia, I was really sun conscious. For a couple of summers there, I did the baby oil thing, and my my mom said, 'Just don't. You'll regret it.'": "Cate",
  "I'm frugal. I've always been this way. When I was young, my mom would give me my allowance, and I'd peel off a little each week and have some to spare.": "Tyra",
  "My mom never taught me to be waiting for some prince on a white horse to swipe me off my feet.": "Tyra",
  "My mom read French 'Elle' when I was a little girl, and so, when I was 15 or 16, I said, 'I want to work in fashion.'": "Carine",
  "Sometimes you think you aren't a good mama you always feel a bit guilty when you're a mom. You want to be everywhere. ": "Carine",
  "I'm not bothered by the idea of getting old, or I guess you could say by having arrived at old. I was 10 when my mom turned 55. For 1955, she was a very old mom.": "Penn",
  "My mom, if you asked her if she was interested in whether or not people gambled, would say no.": "Penn",
  "My mom and dad were divorced, and although they got along very well, my mom thought American television was reprehensible, so I was raised on the BBC. I kind of agreed with her. We watched American news, though.": "Joss",
  "I kept telling my mom that reading comic books would pay off.": "Joss",
  "I'd go to, like, six different schools in one year. We were on welfare, and my mom never ever worked.": "Eminem",
  "Language-wise, my mom and dad's dialect, they're pretty obscure. It's Chinese, but not your traditional Chinese, like Cantonese or Mandarin. It wasn't something that I got to use very much growing up. We eventually just spoke English around the house.": "James",
  "There were times my mom and I butted heads - over my curfew, over something like that. Whenever we would hit these moments of emotional backfire, she would say, 'You just don't understand what it's like to be a mother... I could never handle losing you.' I was like, 'OK, but just, like, chill out.'": "Brie",
  "We had very few things. I had a couple pairs of jeans, a couple shirts. And same with my mom and sister. I think my sister had, like, two toys. We were living off of instant noodles.": "Brie",
  "I was 3 when I told my mom that I knew what my dharma was and that I wanted to be an actor.": "Brie",
  "I was home-schooled, was always very close with my mom and was very straight-laced and square. I was never the rebellious one, and I never threw hissy fits.": "Brie",
  "When I was seven, I had been very vocal about wanting to be an actor. And my mom decided that we would try it out for a couple weeks and come to L.A. from Sacramento.": "Brie",
  "We lived in just a studio apartment with just a room and a bed that came out of the wall, and my mom couldn't afford even a Happy Meal. We ate Top Ramen. I had no toys, and I had, like, two shirts, a pair of jeans, and that was it. But I had my mom to myself, and I remember it being the coolest period of time. I loved it. I really loved it.": "Brie",
  "I didn't realise how hard it was to be a mom and keep it all together.": "Brie",
  "I was home-schooled, was always very close with my mom, and was very straight-laced and square. I was never the rebellious one, and I never threw hissy fits. I was the type of person that would show a Powerpoint presentation about why I should do something versus crying and screaming over it.": "Brie",
  "I was born in Sacramento but moved to Los Angeles with my mom and my little sister when I was seven.": "Brie",
  "My mom used to tell me, 'If you read 50 books, I'll get you a motorbike.'": "Orlando",
  "I'm not a religious person. My mom was of Jewish blood and my dad was Protestant.": "Daniel",
  "My dad believes in God, I think. I'm not sure if my mom does. I don't.": "Daniel",
  "I don't know where my romanticism comes from. My mom and dad would read to me a lot. 'Treasure Island,' 'Robinson Crusoe,' tales of chivalry and knights, things like that. Those are the stories I loved growing up.": "Daniel",
  "For years, my mom dated a man who was really active in the Baptist church in the town next to the town I grew up in, and so he used to drag me to these Baptist church services that lasted forever. I remember that I didn't like the church services, but I really liked the music.": "Moby",
  "When I was little, I'd pick flowers wherever I traveled with my mom, then dry them, cover them with resin, and turn them into paperweights.": "Ivanka",
  "My mom grew up in the Soviet Bloc, and she was a Tiger Mom. We didn't get away with much.": "Ivanka",
  "I dyed my hair blonde when I was 14. My mom was not happy. But I love being blonde.": "Rita",
  "I could get away with not taking care of myself as a bachelorette but as a mom I can't.": "Alanis",
  "My mom is at my house every day, and she nags me about everything, especially hygiene.": "Shia",
  "My mom is the backbone not just of my family but of many families.": "Shia",
  "Like a lot of you, I grew up in a family on the ragged edges of the middle class. My daddy sold carpeting and ended up as a maintenance man. After he had a heart attack, my mom worked the phones at Sears so we could hang on to our house.": "Elizabeth",
  "My mom would have different fragrances for different times of the year. They were a part of her identity. I don't remember the specific ones she used, but I remember the bottles.": "Blake",
  "My mom taught me this really great beauty tip. She used to put oil or mayonnaise on the bottom half of her hair before she would shower.": "Blake",
  "My mom and dad always taught acting, so instead of getting me babysitters, they would just bring me to class.": "Blake",
  "My mom is a huge woman of worth for me because she's been my idol my whole life. My mom was someone who juggled everything. She had her own career, she raised five kids, she was Superwoman... and she was never satisfied doing just one thing because... she probably just had too much energy.": "Blake",
  "I used to have a blankie, and when my mom had to wash it, I would sit outside the dryer and watch it go round and round, and cry.": "Drew",
  "I grew up in a makeup chair. And to see the women around me getting ready was so aspirational. It's about mothers and daughters, a girl watching her mom at a vanity table.": "Drew",
  "My parents did divorce, but my dad has always been present for me and loving me and my mom as well when she was alive.": "Rob",
  "My mom and dad used to tell me, 'You've got to see this film,' and they were influential to a high degree of the films I saw as a kid.": "Jason",
  "My mom was a great tennis player, and I remember being six or seven years old watching Steffi Graf and Monica Seles in Wimbledon in my house. I've always been a tennis fan.": "Tom",
  "As I celebrate life, I can't help but think how young my mom was when she died of a heart attack at 53. My mom didn't get to meet her grandchildren, but I'm determined to watch mine grow up.": "Andie",
  "Okay, fluoride in the water to help our teeth. Well, shouldn't that be the job of your mom and dad? To teach you how to brush your teeth and use mouth wash? What do we need the government to do it for? Clearly, what a scam. Fluoride in the water.": "Jesse",
  "If I were to work with my mom, I probably would not want her to play my mom. That would get too real.": "Zooey",
  "My nursery school did a production of 'The Three Little Pigs.' I played the third pig. When the wolf knocked on my door, I refused to get up and answer it because, to me, he was knocking the wrong way. I just lay there, snoring away on stage, fully immersed in my character. My dad turned to my mom and said: 'Dustin Hoffman.'": "Zooey",
  "I wanted to be a child actor so bad that every day I'd beg my parents if I could audition, but my mom said, 'Not until you can drive yourself to auditions.'": "Zooey",
  "I was brought up as an only child, and we were very close. But when I was 14, we got evicted. We came home to a padlock, and I looked up at my mom and she was crying, and there was nothing to do.": "Dwayne",
  "I became a mom at 37 and having a child has been an emancipation for me.": "Tori",
  "When I was little, my mom tells me, I used to say things like, 'Mom do you hear the string section? Do you hear the string section?' And she would look at me and say, 'No honey, I don't know what you're talking about.'": "Tori",
  "My mom lived with me until I started making enough money to support myself. I was asking her to leave the entire time. I'd been ready to move out since I was, like, 14.": "Megan",
  "My dad used to hunt ducks, and my mom would put them in the pot. We lived really modestly. We had very little money.": "Megan",
  "My life started on the banks of the Boyne in County Meath. Navan is the name of the town; only me, Mom, Dad.": "Pierce",
  "I made some truly awful movies. 'Stop! Or My Mom Will Shoot' was the worst. If you ever want someone to confess to murder just make him or her sit through that film. They will confess to anything after 15 minutes.": "Sylvester",
  "Whenever I don't get injured, the film is a dud. I didn't bleed on 'Rhinestone.' I didn't bleed on 'Stop! Or My Mom will Shoot.'": "Sylvester",
  "I don't want a life without my mom in it, but I'm not someone who curls up in the fetal position and says, 'Mommy, take care of me!' I don't like people catering to me. It feels so awkward and uncomfortable.": "Khloe",
  "I've always wanted to have kids. I do think I would be a great mom.": "Khloe",
  "I didn't go to many movies. My mom would make a family outing and bring chicken in the theater. Smell up the whole place. The most impactful movies were 'Godfather II' and 'Scarface'. I loved the human complexity, and those movies are so well shot. Cinematic greatness. I really stopped going in my early twenties.": "Jay-Z",
  "And to this day, my Mom is my role model.": "Paul",
  "A Romney-Ryan administration will protect and strengthen Medicare, for my Mom's generation, for my generation, and for my kids and yours.": "Paul",
  "My mom's now enjoying Medicare. She's already retired. She earned it. But for those of us, you know, the X-Generation on down, it won't be there for us on its current path.": "Paul",
  "I was a brownie for a day. My mom made me stop. She didn't want me to conform.": "Sandra",
  "I'm simply the mom who makes the lunch, drives to school, finds where the toys are, washes the clothes, and I'm here to play. And that's all I should be.": "Sandra",
  "Every single second of every single day... I don't know if I feel like a bad mom, but at the end of the day I'm always plagued with, 'Did I do enough? Should I go in a different direction?'": "Sandra",
  "I watched my mom and dad build everything that matters - a family, a home and a good name.": "Mike",
  "I am criticizing a culture that has sold the big lie that 'Mom doesn't matter.'": "Mike",
  "There were evictions that I saw that I know I'll never forget. In one case, the sheriff and the movers came up on a house full of children. The mom had passed away, and the children had just gone on living there. And the sheriff executed the eviction order - moved the kids' stuff out on the street on a cold, rainy day.": "Matthew",
  "The face of America's eviction epidemic is a mom with kids.": "Matthew",
  "My mom was a problem solver.": "Anne",
  "I first heard about 'genes' when I was six years old. At dinner one night, I heard my mom tell my sister, 'It's in your genes.'": "Anne",
  "I grew up with my mom being very, very cheap, so when it's free, I'm like, 'Oh my God, it's free - I have to take as much as I can!'": "Anne",
  "My mom would still be mad if I didn't say 'please' and 'thank you.'": "Selena",
  "My mom always told me if I love what I'm doing, and I'm having fun, then just continue to do it. But if it's not fun for me anymore, and I'm miserable, then I'm going to go back to Texas and quit it all, to be honest.": "Selena",
  "One of the most important things for me is my hair. I've always been about my hair, and I love that my mom and my nana taught me how to take care of it myself. It goes through a lot every day, but I try to keep it healthy. I have to admit, it can get a little dead on the ends.": "Selena",
  "My mother told me one day I walked in to her and said, 'Mom, I'm not going to be sick anymore,' and she said 'Why?' and I said 'Because an angel told me so.' Now, I don't remember saying it; that's just what she told me.": "Prince",
  "We come from fallible parents who were kids once, who decided to have kids and who had to learn how to be parents. Faults are made and damage is done, whether it's conscious or not. Everyone's got their own 'stuff,' their own issues, and their own anger at Mom and Dad. That is what family is. Family is almost naturally dysfunctional.": "Chris",
  "My nana was an actress, my mom was an actress, and my sister, too. So because I was surrounded by it, it really came naturally.": "Chris",
  "Becoming a mom forced me to re-prioritize and make room for the things that are most important, while recognizing that there are things I can let go of, and the world won't crumble around me.": "Shakira",
  "I remember that at the beginning of the month, the kind of menus my mom and father would prepare for us would have fish, chicken. But at the end of the month - because my father would be waiting for paycheck - the refrigerator would get empty. I remember that without a lot of food left, some of the best meals happened right there.": "Jose",
  "My mom and I had the same vision, and we want the same things. We would always make a goal list every year.": "Kim",
  "I always wanted what Mom and Dad had.": "Kim",
  "I used to enjoy the spotlight. If I had a day off from filming, I didn't know what to do. Now I enjoy my family time so much, there is this sense of, if it all went away, and I was just a mom, I would love my life.": "Kim",
  "I have spoken honestly about being born into a home where there was discord and chaos. I saw my mom have a rough time with my dad being very controlling, which is why I push back whenever I feel like someone is trying to box me in. It makes me run for the hills.": "Christina",
  "I remember watching the Grammys and looking at the performances and crying to my mom, saying how much I wanted to be there.": "Christina",
  "My mom brought me up to believe that my talent is a gift and a blessing.": "Christina",
  "At 13, I was wearing plain t-shirts. Then I used to steal my mom's clothing. She had all these crushed-velvet shirts with French-cut sleeves. And, like, seersucker bell-bottoms.": "Johnny",
  "Family dinner in the Norman Rockwell mode had taken hold by the 1950s: Mom cooked, Dad carved, son cleared, daughter did the dishes.": "Nancy",
  "I'm happy that I took time off to become a mom and raise my daughter properly and build a bond between the two of us.": "Christina",
  "My mom was a cheerleader and had me as a teenager. I remember her giving me some pom-poms and teaching me how to do some splits when I was 3 or 4.": "Christina",
  "I've been a fan of 'Rocky Horror'... my mom let me see it at a really early age.": "Christina",
  "As a mom, that's at the forefront of everything in my mind, so I'm always trying to balance, whether it's bringing Violet to work or, the second I am done working, getting home to her.": "Christina",
  "My mom has gone out of her way in her personal life. She's been with me on the road. She's had to deal with people giving her the 'that's the mom' and arguing. Just little things as a businesswoman.": "Christina",
  "I like a family guy. He must be fun, must like to go out, and has to respect his mom... my family is very important, so it should be likewise for him.": "Christina",
  "From singing to acting to songwriting to mom to fashion designer! It's been quite an evolution.": "Christina",
  "I've always felt a certain guilt to have them labeled as 'Christina's sisters' or, 'That's Christina's mom' but them looking for the respect to be named Elizabeth and Danielle and Carmen.": "Christina",
  "When I go home, I still have to clean my room; I still have to do the dishes. We have somebody come every now and then to do that stuff, but my mom still makes me clean before she comes.": "Christina",
  "I am compelled to continuously see the bright side. It is in my DNA. My kids look at me and say: 'Mom, you're so happy!' And I do feel happy. I feel joyful inside. I can't explain it.": "Goldie",
  "When I started go-go dancing on tables for a living, I didn't want to tell my mom or my dad. I made 25 dollars a night, and I was able to make my rent, with the four girls I lived with.": "Goldie",
  "I forgive my mom for being a psycho and my dad for being a loser.": "Nikki",
  "My mom, you know, took off when I was about 6. What ended up happening is I ended up being with my grandparents.": "Nikki",
  "My wife is the greatest person I have ever known. She is just a living doll; she is great person and a great mom. We have a girl and a boy, and we are going to have another boy.": "Alec",
  "I think I would make a lousy stay-at-home mom. It just wouldn't suit me.": "Claire",
  "My mom is still yelling at me because she needs more autographed pictures.": "Ashton",
  "My mom's whole side of the family, they're all Packers fans. My mom's a Bears fan. My stepdad is a Vikings guy. So that gets ugly. My mom sits upstairs watching the Bears game; he sits in the basement. They can't watch it together. Football's a violent anger in our family dynamic.": "Ashton",
  "If you think back to the first sporting event you went to, you don't remember the score, you don't remember a home run, you don't remember a dunk. You remember who you were with. Were you with your mom, your dad, your brother, on a date?": "Mark",
  "There's nothing more frustrating than when fans use a nickname. That's like people you don't know using names from people that you're intimate with. Like if my mom has a nickname and a fan finds it out and starts using it, that's creepy.": "Evangeline",
  "People were fed up with reality shows about midgets getting married and weird Jerry Springer talk shows. There had been a real dry spell of intelligent family-oriented viewing: the type of program that Mom, Dad and the kids can all watch together. With 'Lost,' there are just so many characters for people to invest in.": "Evangeline",
  "I will share a personal experience: my father was posted in Jammu & Kashmir during the Kargil war. I remember my mom sitting in front of television throughout the day reading tickers which had name of the martyrs.": "Anushka",
  "I knew I wanted to become an actor when I was 7 years old. My dad was working with Alfred Hitchcock, my mom was working with Martin Scorsese - and it was the great summer of my childhood.": "Laura",
  "I feel so lucky to have a mom who is not only an extraordinary actor but someone who is game enough to not worry about our relationship versus what we play in movies or television.": "Laura",
  "I think my mom exposed me to the concept of using your voice for anything you care about.": "Laura",
  "I'll tell you, Liz Cheney is going to be a very good candidate. I worked with her during the Bush campaigns. She's smart, she's focused, she's disciplined - and she's got a great back story. She's got a large family. She's a great mom. And she's a hard worker. I think she's going to be a very effective campaigner.": "Mark",
  "The only reason I felt like I could sing a song like 'Blown Away' is because I have definitely lived through my fair share of trips to the cellar in the spring. We were no stranger to that. I still ask my mom, 'Is the cellar cleaned out now? Is everything OK?' Even in my new house, I had something built in it that's like a storm shelter.": "Carrie",
  "My mom had a job, and she also took care of us, and she also took care of Dad - I always saw her pulling triple duty, doing more than I ever felt like she needed to. I made a promise to myself that it would be more of a team effort in my family someday. And because of that, I became more independent.": "Carrie",
  "My mom wouldn't let me buy clothes she didn't like, so I dressed like a middle-aged woman in high school.": "Gillian",
  "My mom wouldn't know Tom Cruise if he punched her in the face.": "Gillian",
  "My mom always said fighting with me as a kid was like going to court. I'm trying to realize that being right is not the most important thing.": "Gillian",
  "There were definitely bands and musicians I liked that drove my mother insane. I probably liked them all the more for it! Bjork drove my mom nuts. What I listened to was actually pretty mom-friendly for the most part. I wasn't very rebellious.": "Gillian",
  "I was a different kind of player as a kid and didn't do too much shouting and screaming. If things didn't go my way, I tended to get a bit overwhelmed. All I wanted to do was cry on my mom's shoulder. I didn't know how to handle defeat in front of a crowd, and I didn't want to be the loser.": "John",
  "I am grateful for the lessons I learned from my parents' sacrifices. They often had trouble making ends meet, so we moved for them to find work. I remember my mom would sometimes take on second jobs, like ironing, just so we could buy groceries.": "Rick",
  "My mom never went to college, but for her own children, getting a great education was not an option.": "Rick",
  "My mom was essentially a single mother raising three boys. If anyone could have had any reason to give up, it was her. But she didn't, and neither did we.": "Chuck",
  "Both my parents are Italian. My mom was born and raised in Italy. My dad was born in Canada, but then they moved to Italy.": "Alessia",
  "I'm really in touch with my Italian roots. My mom's whole side of the family is there.": "Alessia",
  "As a kid, my parents would always listen to a lot of Beatles, Queen, Elvis. My mom was born and raised in Italy, and my dad was born in Canada and moved back and forth between Canada and Italy, so they would also listen to all the big Italian stars like Eros Ramazzotti, Gigi D'Alessio, Tiziano Ferro, Laura Pausini.": "Alessia",
  "My mom, dad, grandparents, we all do voices.": "Bill",
  "I grew up with my two sisters and my mom, so it's my lot in life to be surrounded by women.": "Bill",
  "Look, I am in the establishment because my dad, the greatest man alive was president of the United States and my brother, who I adore as well as fantastic brother was president. Fine, I'll take it. I guess I'm part of the establishment Barbara Bush is my mom. I'll take that, too.": "Jeb",
  "One of the greatest, smartest things I ever did was give my kids Angie as their mom. She is such a great mom. Oh, man, I'm so happy to have her.": "Brad",
  "My mom's one of 13 siblings, and they all got six kids, and till I was 13 everybody was in Compton.": "Kendrick",
  "I think number one is what my mom and dad preached to me when I was a little kid: Just because you may have athletic ability and you may be able to play a sport doesn't make you any more special than anybody else. Doesn't mean God loves you more than anybody else.": "Tim",
  "If Mom is healthy, then her child is more likely to thrive, more likely to have a better quality of life and, ultimately, better able to provide for his or herself.": "Christy",
  "I'm not gonna be broke, like my mom was broke, my uncles were broke, my sisters didn't have money, my cousins on down.": "R.",
  "I've always wanted to write movies - I always used to tell my mom that I wanted to be a director.": "R.",
  "My mom actually had a band called Six Pack - even though there were seven of them - who went around Chicago performing popular songs. Her voice was like Gladys Knight mixed with Aretha Franklin.": "R.",
  "I wish I had an extra day with my mom sometimes. Or another hour in the day with my family, husband and children.": "Mary",
  "There are a lot of people who helped make Queen Latifah who she is today. I don't forget, but a lot of people do and get big heads. My mom will make me walk the dogs or take out the trash when I go home. I'm not allowed to get a big head; I've still got to do the simple things in life.": "Queen",
  "I think I'd be a great mom, honestly. I don't think I'll have any problem giving them all the love in the world. Discipline will be the hard part.": "Queen",
  "My mom will make me walk the dogs or take out the trash when I go home.": "Queen",
  "My mom has always been my champion. She was very smart and grounded. She said, 'Save your money. Pay your taxes. Don't put everything in one basket,' but she let me explore and be creative.": "Queen",
  "I've had letters from people who have read my articles and said, 'I'm a guy, I'm 18, and I've not come out to my mom and dad yet, but it was so nice to hear your story, and you know, I wish your article would have been longer, because you gave me hope for the future.'": "Luke",
  "My mom and stepdad were strict. I couldn't date I couldn't go out. And I was a kid who was never good at just taking no for an answer. I needed to understand why. And sometimes they weren't interested in explaining. ": "Mahershala",
  "My parents were in high school when I was born. My mom was 16, my dad was 17. They were kids, at the very beginning of coming into their own and finding themselves.": "Mahershala",
  "I had a very lovely childhood, and, being an only child, I'm very close to my mom and my dad.": "Luke",
  "I had some interesting costumes... the one that I remember right offhand is Zorro when I was a lot younger. I was a big time Zorro fan. My mom helped me make it, and I remember having a big issue with the fact that she wouldn't let me carry around a real metal sword; it just had to be plastic.": "Sam",
  "I was raising a child full time, sharing the responsibility with his mom. He lived with me half the time, so I chose not to go away and make certain movies.": "Michael",
  "I grew up in rural Pennsylvania, in a really rundown old house. I'd stay out till 8:30, 9:00 at night. Just blow in. My mom and dad never really cared much. It was okay. We were pretty free to roam. I mean, I had no concept of stopping play. It just didn't occur to anyone.": "Michael",
  "My mom was tough.": "Tiger",
  "I get sent a lot of scripts where you're just the mom.": "Winona",
  "Usually, the roles that you get offered that are the mom roles are very much the mom role.": "Winona",
  "I am no mother, and I won't be one.": "Brigitte",
  "I see little girls at my meet-and-greets who are like, 'Kelsea! It's my first concert and I came to see you.' And I'm thinking, 'I don't want to post anything online that your mom would be mad at me for, because you're important to me.'": "Kelsea",
  "Me and my mom made a deal that if something would happen to help me get my start in music, I could get out of college.": "Kelsea",
  "I really wanted to be a mom. I didn't want my kids to be raised by a nanny, which would have been the case if I were working two movies in a year, you know? And I would have been hospitalized with fatigue.": "Robin",
  "Mom was so funny and loving to us kids. She was our first audience. When my dad died, I was suddenly alone in the house with her because my two older brothers were away at college. I was the man of the house, and she was the grieving woman.": "Billy",
  "I was raised mostly by my mom.": "Billy",
  "My wife is so very important to me that it's made my mom more important to me. It's made every woman I know more important to me.": "Jason",
  "My wife and I both grew up with parents who were very young. Her mom was, I think, 17 or 18 when she was born; my mom was 15 when I was born. So, as we got older, we started thinking a lot about that - about the time that those people missed because we came along when we did and because they devoted so much of their lives to taking care of us.": "Jason",
  "I didn't come from a trailer park. I grew up middle class and my dad had money and my mom made my lunch. I got a car when I was sixteen. I'm proud of that.": "Kid",
  "My mom is a yoga instructor: 100% black with dreadlocks.": "Meghan",
  "My dad is Caucasian, and my mom is African American. I'm half black and half white. Being biracial paints a blurred line that is equal parts staggering and illuminating.": "Meghan",
  "Mom cooked a lot of turkey when I was growing up. Turkey meatloaf, turkey burgers, ground turkey shepherd's pie - my childhood was the Bubba Gump of turkey. You'd think I would be sick of it, but when I find gems like Gwyneth Paltrow's turkey meatball recipe, it's as though the fowl is no longer foul to me.": "Meghan",
  "When I was 13 years old, my mom had me start getting facials in my hometown of Los Angeles.": "Meghan",

  "I crave my mom's Sloppy Joes.": "Tom",
  "I skated and rode bikes on ramps, and my mom was always super supportive. She was one of the only divorced moms in the neighborhood, so all the other parents looked down upon her for letting her kids do that kind of thing.": "Spike",
  "Being a mom is what life is about. I hope people realize what the priorities in life should be and know not everything has to be perfect.": "Kourtney",
  "There's no one else I would rather have as my manager than my mom because I know that she has our best interests at heart. Sometimes, it's hard to separate manager mode from mom mode. I think as our manager, my mom will get more emotional about situations than she would if she was just our manager.": "Kourtney",
  "I used to play Donna Karan. I used my dad's home office, and Kim was my assistant. Then one of our friends would play a buyer, and I would take her to my mom's closet and show her the new collection.": "Kourtney",
  "I feel such a sense of empowerment being a mom. But I do wonder: How do they/we do it all?": "Kourtney",
  "I have so many pieces that once belonged to my mom and both of my grandmothers. All of these pieces are very sentimental, and I love to wear them. I also have many pieces from my father that I probably cherish the most. I love wearing his dress shirts.": "Kourtney",
  "My mom and both of my grandmothers have always been into fashion, so it's been around us our whole lives.": "Kourtney",
  "I remember playing in my mom's closet with Kim as little girls - we had this game we played, I was Donna Karan, and she was my assistant, and I was really bossy.": "Kourtney",
  "I've always loved children's clothes - my grandmother actually owned a children's boutique in La Jolla, CA, for 30 years. I grew up visiting her and working in her store, and then my mom and I had a children's boutique together for five or six years.": "Kourtney",
  "I know my mom always likes to give the over-the-top 'wow' pieces at baby showers.": "Kourtney",
  "Sometimes, it's hard to separate manager mode from mom mode. I think, as our manager, my mom will get more emotional about situations than she would if she was just our manager.": "Kourtney",
  "My mom fed us a lot of processed food when we were kids, like chicken fingers, grilled cheese sandwiches and quesadillas. I make those treats for my family, too, but I use organic cheeses and whole wheat bread and tortillas.": "Kourtney",
  "When my younger sisters were born, I was in high school and college. I was at my mom's all the time but never changed them or fed them.": "Kourtney",
  "I'm obsessed with being a mom.": "Kourtney",
  "I'm probably the least harsh on myself, and I try not to scrutinize everything about my body. As a new mom, it is what it is, and we just have to do our best.": "Kourtney",
  "My mom and I had a kids' clothing store called Smooch for six years, and I did all the buying before I even had kids.": "Kourtney",
  "I believe destiny and hard work go hand in hand. I was studying to be an engineer when my mom and my brother sent my pictures for the Miss India contest. I didn't even know about it. If that isn't destiny, what is?": "Priyanka",
  "I like bad boys, and I like to take them home to my mom.": "Priyanka",
  "My mom always told me that I could be anything I wanted to be. And I truly, actually believed it. And I fought.": "Allen",
  "One day my dad would say, 'OK, if you want to play tennis I can help you out.' And that's how it started. And I had a goal. I wanted to beat my mom first. And my parents and my brother. And that was the ultimate goal.": "Caroline",
  "My mom is my great supporter. It's always nice to have her around. She can cook. It's nice to have some home-cooked food sometimes.": "Caroline",
  "My mom was a volleyball player, and my dad was a soccer player. I never thought about it, but they always served healthy food at home, and I love it, and it kind of was a regular part of my day.": "Caroline",
  "I think the real heroic teachers are the ones who work with kids, like my mom and my sister do.": "David",
  "Music education was always big for me. Ever since I was a young kid, I always said it was the reason I went to school sometimes and knowing if I didn't do well in class that my mom wasn't gonna let me sing in school or sing at that concert.": "Darius",
  "The 'believe' tattoo is because my mom always told me to believe.": "Ashley",
  "I don't drink, and I don't smoke. It's a personal preference. My mom has never drunk or smoked. I look up to my mom.": "Ashley",
  "Once in high school, I completely over plucked my left eyebrow all the way up to where you're not supposed to. I had no idea what I was doing and it looked terrible! My mom was like 'What did you do to yourself?' I was so embarrassed.": "Ashley",
  "My mom is very confident and she was always a role model of mine.": "Ashley",
  "The family on my mom's side, their whole business is inventing and pitching stuff. My grandfather is in infomercials. He's a pitchman, so if you're ever watching TV late at night, you'll probably see him pitching knives. My great-grandfather also invented the plastic cheese grater.": "Ashley",
  "I came from a middle-class family. My dad was a professor; my mom was a nurse. I didn't come from money, and I didn't come from circles of power. I didn't come from the country club; I came from the town park.": "Megyn",
  "Yes, I always remember my dad's, mom's and my grandma's perfumes.": "Marc",
  "After school, my sister and I helped our mom in the garden. We grew potatoes, cucumbers, tomatoes - not for fun, but to eat.": "Irina",
  "I either had to concentrate on fighting, or I had to help my family. I chose my family. I love my mom; I love my family.": "Gerry",
  "It's impossible to put yourself first when you're a mom.": "Jillian",
  "I looked to my mom as an example. And this is what I try to tell so many women: that my mom had a career, and she went to the gym. She took care of herself.": "Jillian",
  "Beyonce has set the tone as an aunt. I've set the tone as a mom.": "Solange",
  "When I was young, my mom realized I could dance and hold a beat, and I really danced just for fun. It was good exercise.": "Tom",
  "I hope that, somewhere, Mom and Dad are proud that little Walter is performing with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.": "Walter",
  "My mom was a professional. My dad and mom met each other in a movie called 'New Faces of 1937.' My mom went under the name Thelma Leeds, and she did a few movies, and she was really a great singer, and when she married my dad and started to have a family, she sang at parties.": "Albert",
  "There've been a few mother-daughter movies that are somewhat realistic. But the mother-son movies are more comical than realistic: 'Throw Momma from the Train,' 'Stop! or My Mom Will Shoot.' You don't sit in the dark and go, 'Oh my God, that's my mother.'": "Albert",
  "My grandfather had a paint store. It's what put my mom through college. Small business is part of my family history.": "Sheryl",
  "I looked at my mom and her life, and I thought, 'I don't want that.' I don't think my mom wanted it, either. I think my mom did want to be out there and have a career. She loved working. As soon as we were old enough to feed ourselves, she was out.": "Jane",
  "Me being a black girl in London, whose mom is first-generation African and whose dad is West Indian, gives me a different view. I'm coming at soul from my own place.": "Estelle",
  "My mom, for all intents and purposes, was a single parent.": "Estelle",
  "I think that when you become a mom... you don't really worry about the small stuff. I'm just way more centered. It makes you focus even more on what your goals are in life.": "Ciara",
  "Juggling being a mom and an entertainer is a challenge I face every day.": "Ciara",
  "I always wanted to be a mom.": "Heidi",
  "I was born and raised in East Los Angeles by a single mom who had three biological kids and adopted four more. I never met my dad.": "will.i.am",

  "Mothers and children are human beings, and they will sometimes do the wrong thing.": "Maurice",
  "I probably wouldn't be singing if not for Michael Jackson. When I started singing, I didn't like my tone until my mom put me on to Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder, so listening to the way they used their instrument helped me get more comfortable with my own.": "Ne-Yo",
  "When I was young, my dad, a veteran who attended college on the GI Bill, lost his job at age 55 when the company he worked for was sold. My entire family pitched in - my mom took in sewing, and I got a minimum wage job after school.": "Tammy",
  "I had a dream, my dream came true, and my mom was there for me every step of the way. We didn't do this for any other reason. I am so happy she is here to experience this with me. This would not be the same if she were not by my side.": "Ashton",
  "My mom, God rest her soul - she liked nicknames. In the womb she named me Skip. There was another black guy in Piedmont, W.Va., and his name was Skip. They called him Big Skip, and I was Little Skip.": "Henry",
  "I've never felt like I've exactly traded on my looks. When I was a teenager, I was an ultra late bloomer, and my mom would say it was a blessing because it means you never have to wonder if guys are only interested in you because you've got boobs.": "Anna",
  "My earliest memories as a kid was I would always try to make my mom and my stepdad laugh at dinner. Or make my friends laugh in class. And, I don't know, it's something I just really enjoy doing.": "Justin",
  "When I watch my kids, and I see the primal level at which the sibling relationships are formed, then I completely understand what these unresolved adult sibling problems are based on. You know, 'Mom liked you better' and, 'You got your own room and I didn't.'": "Annette",
  "My wife goes to Birmingham five times a week. My mom lives in Birmingham now after moving from Myrtle Beach. It's not just the job. A lot of people don't get that. My life is here.": "Nick",
  "As a mom, you have all these situations you go through, and you're like, 'What is going on? Is this normal? Is this a phase? Or what is this?' and then you feel silly for asking questions because you think, 'I'm a mom - I'm supposed to know these things,' but you don't.": "Britney",
  "My mom's an angel, bless her heart, for everything I put her through.": "Brantley",
  "I learnt how to make candles when I was a kid. My mom used to make them. Then, when I broke my leg once and couldn't really move around, I started playing around with it... putting the scent inside and dried flowers, and that's it.": "Twinkle",
  "I make bangers all the time, and I knew it was going to come. My mom probably used to think it wasn't going to happen. My daughter's mom thought it wasn't going to happen, and a couple of girlfriends. You just gotta keep on doing it. I'm living proof.": "Ty",
  "My dad had always been a big decaf coffee drinker. But my mom had always been more of a tea drinker. So I grew up around a lot of tea. And I also really love tea. But I'm not one of those people who has ever felt the need to choose between coffee and tea. I think that is a completely false dichotomy.": "Chelsea",
  "My mom grew up in poverty in Oklahoma - like Dust Bowl, nine people in one room kind of place - and the way she got out of poverty was through education. My dad grew up without a dad, with very little and he also made his way out through education.": "Jennifer",
  "My mom and I have always been very close. She is my best friend. She had to make a lot of sacrifices early on in my life to make sure I got to do what I wanted to do.": "Norah",
  "President of the United States is you know, our boss, so you know, the President and the First Lady are kinda like the Mom and the Dad of the country. And when your Dad says something you listen.": "Chris",
  "Because of my unique experience as my mom's child, the beginning of my journey was more about me trying to figure out who I was on my own. My mom is one of the greatest moms and so supportive of all my siblings and of all of us being who we are, and not who she wanted us to be.": "Tracee",
  "I'm ridiculous in my oversharing my mom and sister are very open but a little more judicious than me... and my father is a decidedly private person. ": "Lena",
  "Anytime there was an award show, it was a ritual where me and my mom would sit around and watch with my friends. We would make desserts and buy chips and popcorn and see what our favorite performances of the night were.": "Bebe",
  "A mother who is obsessing about being thin and dieting and exercising is not going to be a very good mother.": "Jane",
  "My mom never wanted to be a grandmom. She never wanted to be a mom, really.": "Pink",
  "All I wanted was for my mom to say, 'I love you, and I'm here for you.' I never got that.": "Kendra",
  "Once you start listening to the comics, be they Jewish, Muslim, Italian, Filipino or whatever, the material often springs from the same source - the overbearing mom, the parents who want you to marry from within your community. That's why the 'Ethnic Show' works so well.": "Maz",
  "My mother gets all mad at me if I stay in a hotel. I'm 31-years-old, and I don't want to sleep on a sleeping bag down in the basement. It's humiliating.": "Ben",
  "I can't resist South Indian cuisine, particularly what is prepared at home. My mom is my favourite cook. She can cook a variety of cuisines. I savour her cooking at home, and she's undoubtedly the best.": "Deepika",
  "I remember, when I was 7, my dad found a pregnant dog on the railroad track one day and brought her home. So my mom explained about how this dog was married but that her husband had passed away - she didn't want me to even think that a dog could have babies without being married.": "Bonnie",
  "My mom did not have money. She was a single mom, on and off in periods between marriages. My husband, however, grew up on a wonderful farm in Tuscany, in Florence, and his family was so entertaining in terms of growing their own food and using the fruit of their land. We have very, very different experiences.": "Debi",
  "My mom put me in a Pampers commercial on TV.": "Christian",
  "I've been reading comics since I was four. I used to get them when I would go grocery shopping with my mom. I remember getting the digest versions of old DC comics. The one that I remember reading first was Paul Levitz' 'Justice Society of America' stuff that he was doing in the '70s.": "Jeff",
  "Green has always been my mom's favorite color. My father, aunt and I have gotten her jade, emerald, and peridot pieces over the years, and we always seem to be on the lookout.": "Erika",
  "When I was a child, I would draw these little stick-figures, and my mom would put them up all over the loft and tell me how wonderful they were. Then you get out there into the harsh reality of the world, and you realize not everybody loves every little thing you do the way your mom did.": "Julia",
  "There is nothing better than being a parent. It is the most challenging job one could ever ask for. I love being a mom and I love being a friend to my children as well.": "Marlee",
  "Take motherhood: nobody ever thought of putting it on a moral pedestal until some brash feminists pointed out, about a century ago, that the pay is lousy and the career ladder nonexistent.": "Barbara",
  "I grew up in a family of Republicans. And when I was 18 and registering to vote, my mom's only instruction was 'You just go in and pull the big Republican lever.' That's my welcome to adulthood. She's like, 'No, don't even read it. Just pull the Republican lever.": "Tina",
  "My mom passed away at 41 from diabetes. And I'm 42, thank you. I didn't want to do that to my son. So any time I was at the gym, that thing that helped me do that last squat was my son calling some other woman mommy. And that would just give me that extra oomph to do that last squat. I want to be around for him.": "Sherri",
  "My mom has always just been one of those people who handle adversity and challenges, and really everything, with so much grace and elegance. I saw it all the time.": "Jillian",
  "One of my favorite things from my mom is a chocolate brown three-piece Chanel outfit. I had it tailored because she taught me the importance of fit.": "Jillian",

  "I'm a soccer mom. I'm T-ball, soccer, karate, homework, keeping them on their schedules. I love being the snack mom, when I get to bring the cut oranges. I have one of those coolers with wheels. I'm at every game, every practice, sitting on my blanket. I love it.": "Pamela",
  "My mom told me to cover up my arms ever since I was little because I was muscular. She wanted me to be feminine, which did not come easy to me. My body was what it was, and I worked it to be a better tennis player.": "Martina",
  "My mom has always been kind of my backbone. She keeps me strong. She is a mother, a friend. She is really everything to me.": "Aerin",
  "I have always loved music. My mom used to sing with my sister and I when I was younger, and I was in choirs and loved to perform, but when I was in college, I went on a study abroad to Trinidad, and while I was there, I sang backup at my first concert.": "Rachel",
  "My dad never blew anything up, but he probably had friends who did. He and my mom have always preached that the pen is mightier than a Molotov cocktail.": "Joseph",

  "My nickname for my mom was 'The Compass.'": "Dane",
  "My dad was very excited about me doing 'Laguna Beach,' and he thought it was a great opportunity. My mom, however, living in Chicago, was a little nervous. I mean she had some reservations about MTV. I think there was a point in my life where I wasn't even allowed to watch MTV!": "Kristin",

  "I'm sponsored by the solar company Goal Zero, and they were gracious enough to install panels on my van and a nice battery system for the inside. I have lights and a fridge inside the van. And of course I had panels installed on my mom's house.": "Alex",
  "Mothers don't let your daughters grow up to be models unless you're present.": "Janice",
  "Depending on what day of the week it is and what time of the month it is, I'm a good friend or not a good friend. I'm more or less a good mom or not a good mom, more or less a good mate or not a good mate. That's just life, whether or not you're public.": "Amy",
  "All of us kids ended up 'doing Mom.' There are four of us who've tried show business. Five if you insist on counting my sister the nun, who does liturgical dance.": "Bill",
  "I want to be a cool mom.": "Tori",
  "I am proud of my kids, but I also want to make my mom proud of me. I'm still a momma's girl at the heart of the situation.": "Tori",

  "I have a very broad demographic, from the 8-year-old who knows every word to 'Ice Ice Baby' and the college kid who grew up on 'Ninja Rap' to the soccer mom and grandparent.": "Vanilla",
  "Puffy's contribution to hip-hop culture was the remix. He offered us the music that his mom played in front of him, with newer drums and younger artists. That worked, and will consistently be there. The remix comes right after the original record, that's something Puffy did to influence the culture.": "Curtis",
  "I had massive anxiety as a child. I was in therapy. From 8 to 10, I was borderline agora-phobic. I could not leave my mom's side. I don't really have panic attacks anymore, but I had really bad anxiety.": "Emma",
  "I don't really see why some of those topical lines have to be crossed to get a point across. I want a mother and daughter, a teenage girl and her mom, to be able to come to the show and both enjoy it on the same level.": "Brett",
  "My mom, through my dad, rented the apartment next door to his... he had the lease on both places. But then, she would dress up and act like his maid... a practical maid. No fantasies.": "Trevor",
  "Dad was the pitching coach, while Mom was the emotional supporter. Her unconditional love was great, and she wanted what was best for me. It was more about what she did than what she said, and she made sure I was the best I could be.": "Jennie",
  "I am a full-time mom; that is my first job. The most important job ever. I started my business when he started school. When he is in school, I do my meetings, my sketches, and everything else. I cook him breakfast. Bring him to school. Pick him up. Prepare his lunch. I spend the afternoon with him.": "Melania",
  "My mom handed me my first romance novel.": "Sylvia",
  "I didn't grow up wealthy. We couldn't even afford spaghetti sauce when I was first born, but my mom and dad worked really hard and came from the bottom up.": "Charlie",
  "I'm able to shift gears from mom to performer to mom pretty quickly.": "Faith",
  "When I was younger, on weekends, my mom would make us pancakes with our initials on them and then a tiny cup of coffee. I remember at 10 sneaking my own coffee and pouring a ton of sugar in and going up to the playroom and drinking it.": "Mary-Kate",
  "After my mom died, there was so much written about her fashion and her style and all that, and I felt that one of the most important parts of her was missing, her real intellectual curiosity.": "Caroline",
  "Every day, my mom and I would watch a different Judy Garland VHS. I love how she tells a story when she sings. It was just about her voice and the words she was singing - no strings attached or silly hair or costumes, just a woman singing her heart out. I feel like that doesn't happen that much anymore.": "Ariana",
  "Some are kissing mothers and some are scolding mothers, but it is love just the same, and most mothers kiss and scold together.": "Pearl",
  "It's the moms of this nation - single, married, widowed - who really hold this country together. We're the mothers, we're the wives, we're the grandmothers, we're the big sisters, we're the little sisters, we're the daughters. You know it's true, don't you? You're the ones who always have to do a little more.": "Ann",
  "I come from a short fiction background, and my mom is a poet, so I've always read poetry; I've always had a lot of different influences both linguistically and musically.": "Lorde",
  "I grew up with an Italian family in an era when a woman's path was laid out for her: You got married and had children. Simple, right? Then I got to a point around the age of 30 when I had three little children and was a single mom, and I realized life was not so simple.": "Joy",
  "Having a child makes you realize the importance of life - narcissism goes out the window. Heaven on earth is looking at my little boy. The minute he was born, I knew if I never did anything other than being a mom, I'd be fine.": "Jenny",
  "My beloved Mom and Pop always rated tops with each other, and that's the way it will always be.": "Ethel",
  "I wanted to do 'Oh Shenandoah' because that's the town I was born in - as a tribute to my mom and dad for giving me all this music. I don't really sing this as a singer, because I'm not a singer. But I wanted to do it for them.": "Charlie",
  "My dad and mom did what a lot of parents did at the time. They sacrificed a lot of their life and used a lot of their disposable income to make sure their children were educated.": "Sundar",
  "Mothers are the necessity of invention.": "Bill",
  "I always had short hair, and I hated my short hair. I was always mistaken for a boy, but my mom wouldn't let me change my hair because she was always chasing me around with a hairbrush, and it was always tangled, so she just would cut it off, and she's right: short hair did suit me.": "Dorothy",
  "Feminists of my mother's generation argued that both mom and dad should work a little less and each do some of the household chores. My parents, for example, split everything 50/50. Even though my father is a terrible cook, he still made dinner exactly half the time.": "Emily",
  "My mom says I'm a fighter, a fierce competitor, and I think I am, too.": "Gabby",
  "Oprah has definitely caught my eye. My mom and I used to watch her shows. We just love her.": "Gabby",
  "The woman is uniformly sacrificed to the wife and mother.": "Elizabeth",
  "I realized that if you try to be the perfect mom, perfect wife, perfect actress, you start to feel overwhelmed. You shut down. I got that really fast... I was running back and forth from breast-feeding to filming a scene, overextending myself on every level. I realized I have to make priorities, and my family is number one no matter what.": "Jenna",
  "My dad was a produce man. He worked in grocery stores for 35 years. My mom just babysat kids and raised us. I have four sisters and one brother. I'm the baby.": "Brandon",
  "My dad's name is Vernon and my mom liked the initials, V. V. My sisters and I got named Victoria, Valerie and Vincent so we'd be V. V.'s, too. But, then when you start getting pets' names that start with a 'v,' it's a little embarrassing.": "Vince",
  "Luckily, I was raised by a kind of gypsy family, which is why I always get along better with people who worked in circuses than with kids of other actors. My mom was so carefree with us in a beautiful way. We were used to sleeping anywhere.": "Lou",
  "I came from a broken home, so my mom was a major influence in my life.": "Julius",
  "My mom was a saint. She taught me to be terminally nice.": "Iggy",
  "I was who I was in high school in accordance with the rules of conduct for a normal person, like obeying your mom and dad. Then I got out of high school and moved out of the house, and I just started, for lack of a better term, running free.": "Iggy",
  "As we all know, there is no harder or more rewarding job than being a mom.": "Kirsten",
  "On signing day, my mom brought me the national letter of intent to Arkansas. I should feel like I'm making the right decision. You get that many people telling you that. I had been dreaming about it. I signed 'No' where I was supposed to sign my name and put an exclamation point.": "DeAngelo",
  "I was embarrassed that I even wanted to become an actress because coming from L.A., with two older sisters in the business and a mom who had been a ballet dancer, it was such a cliche.": "Elizabeth",
  "I want to make my music and be a happy woman, a good wife, a good mom and one day hopefully have a child of my own.": "LeAnn",
  "My mom grew up in Idaho, went to Brigham Young University: they're very Molly Mormon. And my father is, like, first generation Albanian, and his parents lived in Southey and grew up in downtown Boston. My parents are complete opposites.": "Eliza",
  "We didn't have a TV in the living room and all my friends thought we were kind of weird. When they'd come over, my mom wanted to talk to them about current events.": "Eliza",
  "My voice has always been kind of distinct - even when I was four years old, my mom told me that people would be like, 'Why does your daughter always sound like a chain smoker?' I've always had this deep, raspy voice.": "Banks",
  "My mom doesn't post on Facebook, but she'll tell anyone within about the first five minutes of meeting them about my sister and I, in whatever way she can.": "Maria",
  "I'm a really bad liar. My mom finds out every time, especially now that she's got Facebook.": "Pixie",
  "My mom is a painter and an artist. She would play music, and she always had very good taste in music, fashion, and art. She was also a young single mom, so I think she had really good style; she was really free... just really inspiring in her own way and allowed me to find the direction I wanted to take in my life.": "Ruby",
  "I remember how my mom would take me on the subway from Queens to Broadway. We'd go to the offices of casting agents. Many doors were slammed in our faces. I was just a boy, but I remember that well.": "Dick",
  "My mom allowed me to take an old burlap bag and fill it with moss, corn stalks and rocks, then hang it from a tree and spend an hour a day punching my heavy bag.": "Joe",
  "My mom used to tell me: 'It's not what you weigh it's what you look like.' ": "Gina",
  "You can blame my mom for some of my worst fashion moments. She used to dress me and my sister in a lot of patterns. Like, she would put me in striped stockings with a floral dress. Like, why are you doing that to me?": "Hailey",
  "When I was 12, I was living in Iowa, and I emailed so many wrestling schools, and one of them was actually in Boston. I joined it at 18 - the New England Pro Wrestling Academy. They were doing a fantasy camp. I was 17 about to turn 18. I told my mom, 'I'm 18 now. I just signed these papers by myself, and I'm going to do this.'": "Sasha",
  "My mom taught me to live by the three p's: to always be passionate, persistent, and prepared.": "Hailee",
  "My mom had started to go to work when I was nine or ten, so I was aware of women trying to find their own identities by working. But I was still influenced by men to such an extreme. I wanted to play their games and wanted to compete in their world and be like them.": "Elisabeth",
  "Dilip Kumar was the only Bollywood hero who could make a girl shiver just by looking at her. If you don't believe it, ask your mom!": "Imtiaz",
  "When you're adopted, no matter what, you've got issues with unconditional love. And you find out you're the product of the worst situation for a young girl to be in and start her life, and I'm so grateful that my birth mom made the decision she made. She came from a rough situation.": "Rodney",
  "I was a sickly baby, and after two sets of adoptive parents took me home, they returned me to the orphanage because of a serious respiratory infection. But as they say, the third time's a charm, because my mom and dad adopted me and took me into their home where I was raised in a family full of love.": "Rodney",
  "My mom told me as a youngster I was always intellectual, like as far as being able to adapt fast and quick. But I had a fun childhood, went to regular school.": "Chris",
  "I want to make sure I continue to make good music that my mom and everybody around me can be proud of.": "Ruben",
  "I'm fighting hard; I'm training hard. I'm still walking over people and stepping over people to get where I'm going, and I would really like to give back, especially to my mom, who was there for me when I was a kid.": "Nate",
  "The fact that I'm very close with my past relationships is something I pride myself on. My mom is still close to her first husband. It's nice to be able to enjoy someone in a different form.": "Kate",
  "I was actually the one who decided to move to LA. Mom and I were driving on Sunset Boulevard during one of our trips back to see her family, and I said, 'Can we just stay?' So we did.": "Lily",
  "Mothers always find ways to fit in the work - but then when you're working, you feel that you should be spending time with your children and then when you're with your children, you're thinking about working.": "Alice",
  "Over the years my mom has become a self-taught Biblical scholar.": "Kathie",
  "I love what I do and I think it shows. As my kids get older, they can see me as a mom who loves working.": "Jessica",
  "My father came from Germany. My mom came from Venezuela. My father's culturally German, but his father was Japanese. I was raised in New York and spent two years in Rio. My parents met at the University of Southern Mississippi, and they had me there, and then we moved to New York. I'm not very familiar with Mississippi.": "Fred",
  "I always say I am a realist, and my mom says, 'No, you just have anxiety.'": "Jessica",
  "We grew up devout Catholics, so my trips to San Juan always include going to the churches that we used to go to and lighting candles and everything. Everything I do in San Juan is what I used to do with my mom, kind of as a tribute to her.": "Cristela",
  "My mother thinks I could have even run a larger company.": "Christie",
  "My brother Jim and I spent many wonderful summers working on dairy farms in Wisconsin owned by Mom's cousins, and as members of our local Boy Scout troop.": "Peter",
  "My mom's always been a good cook, so I took a lot of stuff from her, but most of the stuff I took from Emeril or Bobby Flay right off the TV and make it. I just loved to cook, so it just became a thing. It's a release. Even if I'm alone, I'll cook a full meal, maybe even a two-course meal, just because I love to cook. It's my secret love!": "Christian",
  "My mom loved to sing - and I'll go on record and say she was the worst singer ever. I'd get up and move away from her!": "Kenny",
  "My wrestling and family go together. It's always been that way, from day one with my mom and dad, my sister, my wife, four daughters, grandsons, son-in-laws.": "Dan",
  "When I was about 6, my cousin was very active in a Filipino repertory company, doing musicals and plays. Her aunt was one of the founders of the company, and she told my mom that there were these auditions for 'The King and I,' and that they needed kids. I auditioned, got in and the love affair started from there and just kept going.": "Lea",
  "A woman must combine the role of mother, wife and politician.": "Emma",
  "Some days I really love being a mom, and some days I don't! It's crazy - I'm tired of packing lunches!": "Michelle",
  "I'd love to open a restaurant that changes every month. One month it would be a mom and bar spaghetti-and-meatball, Red Sox place, and the next it would be a British pub, and everyone gets in a fight.": "Graham",
  "I pretty much look like an identical twin of my mom.": "Odell",
  "I was raised - my mom and dad were dairy farmers. Once you've made a decision to plant a crop for that year, you can't go back and undo that decision.": "Roy",
  "I guess I was a mom so late in life, my daughter was the greatest thing since sliced bread.": "Candice",
  "My mother worked in factories, worked as a domestic, worked in a restaurant, always had a second job.": "Ed",
  "My mom would give me a piece to play, but I wouldn't do any theory because when it came time to do it I would sneak back upstairs and watch TV. So, I had these kind of nonchalant lessons for years, then it just started soaking in.": "Vanessa",
  "When I was a baby, I wore my mom's Chanel pumps - to be able to say that I work with Karl Lagerfeld is a dream come true.": "Lily-Rose",
  "My mom gave me a Chanel dress when I was younger. I felt special. I think anybody feels special in Chanel.": "Lily-Rose",
  "My mother was a personal friend of God's. They had ongoing conversations.": "Della",
  "I love being at home now, improving my cooking. I've got a really bad memory, so my first attempts were a disaster - I'd forget what ingredients to put in. But I do a lasagna that's a crowd-pleaser, and a good lemon drizzle cake, which I take to my mom's for the Sunday roast to fatten the family up.": "Katy",
  "I was two years old when my mom put me in mommy and me classes. I always had a lot of energy so it was the perfect fit!": "Aly",
  "A few weeks after my mom passed in November of 2013, I came back from an injury and entered the Egg Bowl in the second half against Ole Miss. I'll never forget the feeling when I walked back out on the field. As I walked into the Egg Bowl, the crowd stood up and clapped like they were enveloping me in a giant hug.": "Dak",
  "I go back five generations in Jamaica. My dad grew up in Port Royal, and my mom grew up in Kingston. My family is from the country like West Moreland and also in Manchester. I've been there countless times. As far as cuisine, there's not really much that comes out of Jamaica that's on a plate that I don't like.": "Dule",
  "Always it gave me a pang that my children had no lawful claim to a name.": "Harriet",
  "I'm a Mommy's Girl - the strongest influence in my young life was my mom.": "Susie",
  "I have an incredible role model in my mom. She was a single mother raising two kids in New York.": "Kim",
  "Mother is far too clever to understand anything she does not like.": "Arnold",
  "I'm sure that my mom would have been happy with any path I chose.": "Joely",
  "Both me and Ishmeet were very naughty. We used to have my grandfather's swords in the house. We used to take all these swords and take all the showpieces Mom had and slice them one by one. He actually locked my nana in the kitchen once for two hours.": "Karan",
  "I wanted to escape so badly. But of course I knew I couldn't just give up and leave school. It was only when I heard my mom's voice that I came out of my hiding place.": "Zhang",
  "Everyone checks out my mom. My mom's hot.": "Ashley",
  "I am truly my mother's son.": "David",
  "With social media, people share mostly their best moments. Don't feel like you're not doing enough when you see a mom posting about making applesauce after you bought it. Ha ha! It's fine! Just for raising a little human being, you should be commended.": "Vanessa",
  "I think while all mothers deal with feelings of guilt, working mothers are plagued by guilt on steroids!": "Arianna",
  "I loved the glamour and excitement of the games and, in particular, knowing the names of each and every one of the referees - that's because my mom, a former basketball player, would yell at them from our front-row seats for making bad calls!": "Hannah",
  "When I first got into the entertainment industry, I would always watch Rihanna and all those people, so I was like, 'Ooh, I have to be this.' So my mom was like, 'Just be yourself.'": "Willow",
  "My parents, especially my mother, were no influence on me whatsoever.": "Andy",
  "My mother told me on several different occasions that she was livin' her dream vicariously through me. She once said that I was getting' to do all the things that she would have wanted to have done.": "Buck",
  "I do believe that there are African Americans who have thick accents. My mom has a thick accent; my relatives have thick accents. But sometimes you have to adjust when you go into the world of film, TV, theatre, in order to make it accessible to people.": "Viola",
  "Mom and sister played piano growing up; my grandma still plays piano in church. They always beat me over the head trying to get me to play piano, but I was more interested in riding dirt bikes and playing in the mud.": "Dustin",
  "The man in our society is the breadwinner; the woman has enough to do as the homemaker, wife and mother.": "Dorothy",
  "I couldn't wait until I grew up. I used to look at my mom's stockings and put them on with her high heels and mess with my hair.": "Florence",
  "At 3 years old, I was imitating and doing fun little commercials for the family. Then at 5, I knew, 'OK, this is something I really like.' At 8, I was crying in front of the mirror and my mom was like, 'Oh boy, here we go. We know what she's going to do.'": "Lana",
  "Giving birth was easier than having a tattoo.": "Nicole",
  "My mom has been my support system from day one. Admiring the type of person she is gives me a sense of what to look for in my ideal cheerleader when the time comes.": "OMI",
  "My dad's an architect and my mom owned a French bakery for twelve years.": "Alison",
  "Sometimes, if you don't have kids yourself, it's assumed you won't understand or know how to play a mom, which is kind of silly if you think about it.": "Tricia",
  "When I was seven and told my mom, 'I'm gonna be a writer,' she said, 'Oh, that's a terrible idea. You'll live in misery and die teaching other people's children badly.' My parents wanted the safer path for me, and I think they failed miserably achieving that.": "Stephen",
  "It's my favorite role - being a mom.": "Teri",
  "Being a mother is hard and it wasn't a subject I ever studied.": "Ruby",
  "Of course having a baby derails the writing process for some time. And I will be the first to say that I have essentially no social life, because there's just nothing left after being a mom, professor, and writer. I used to be big into rock climbing. No more. A lot falls by the wayside.": "Marie",
  "The first seven years of my life, me, my mom and dad and my four older siblings lived in a suburb of Stockholm, and my mom was very active with directing theater. So I basically grew up at the theater on the floors of the shows, so I was really surrounded with music at a young age.": "Erik",
  "When I was in the 9th grade, on Halloween night, when you're supposed to go and out and burn your city, my mom made me go to 'Cirque du Soleil.' I was kicking and screaming. This girl came out onstage, and I was instantly mesmerized. I dropped out of school and became obsessed with her. I saw the show, like, 70 times.": "Troy",
  "My mom was always pretty supportive. She saw me do plays and she'd always act out the parts I did. My aunt, who played a big part in my life, was a little bit more reserved, because if they don't see you on TV every week they think you must be starving.": "Angela",
  "If I should have a daughter, instead of 'Mom,' she's gonna call me 'Point B,' because that way she knows that no matter what happens, at least she can always find her way to me. And I'm going to paint solar systems on the backs of her hands so she has to learn the entire universe before she can say, 'Oh, I know that like the back of my hand.'": "Sarah",
  "I loved theater growing up, and my mom always took us to the touring productions that would come through town. We would go to Chicago all the time and see shows. I loved it.": "Robin",
  "I'm very quiet. In the beginning, my brother would play the piano, and I would sing, because that's what my mom and dad did. And then along the way, somebody teased me for even thinking that I could get up there. That stayed with me, and I became very shy.": "Tyka",
  "We were never the family that ordered pizza, and my mom never came home with a bucket of fried chicken. My mom always made home-cooked meals. We always sat down at the dinner table as a family.": "Haylie",
  "My grandma and my mom are not happy about the fact that I am still a bachelor. It's not on my mind that I have to find the person I'm going to spend the rest of my life with. It will happen the way it's going to happen.": "Maksim",
  "My dad is a lawyer and my mom is an artist. So growing up was exactly what it sounds like - strict household but a lot of creativity. They are so psyched that I get to make music for a living. My parents rule.": "Ty",
  "My mom used to call us 'free range kids,' like free range chickens... We roamed the countryside.": "William",
  "Choose wisely, then eat in moderation. When I know I'm going to Mom's for dinner, I throw an extra 20 minutes on the cardio machine so I can be ready to eat.": "Danny",
  "I went to elementary like any other kid, but I was just always a little different. I had that sparkle, and everyone told my mom, 'She needs to be on TV, acting.'": "Raven",
  "I'm not a figurehead for anything. I was a single mom with two kids. What else was I going to do? It was either be in a band or be a waitress.": "Chrissie",
  "I was a big fan of 'The Smurfs' growing up, even though by default - my mom used to force me to watch because she was a 'Smurfs' fan.": "Jayma",
  "I've had a lot of mother figures. But by the time my mom came into my life, it wasn't a 'mommy' thing. It's more of an adult relationship.": "Paris-Michael",
  "When my wife and I met, I couldn't talk to her - and my defense mechanism is sarcasm. I belittle someone with verbal pokes and prods. I did it to her out of complete awe. When friends introduced us, I said 'Hi' - and turned my back. Later, I called my mom and best friend and said, 'I think I just met my wife.'": "Mike",
  "My earliest acting memory is making up a play for my mom and dad called The Lonesome Baby. I have no idea what The Lonesome Baby was about. I just remember the title. But I'm sure it was an epic.": "Jane",
  "On my mom's side I'm Mexican, and my dad is a white dude.": "Tyler",
  "The very end of me mom's road is the back entrance to Bray Head. Usually climb it when I get home.": "Tristan",
  "My earliest memory is seeing Michael Jackson in Melbourne with my sister when I was about ten. I still have this souvenir stick with a glove that would light up and make a peace sign in a bunch of different colors. I'm so happy my mom didn't throw that out.": "Emilie",
  "So, from a very young age, my mom tells me that I wanted to be Michael J. Fox. I didn't want to be an actor. I just wanted to be Michael J. Fox for awhile. And then, I realized that he was an actor, so I pursued that.": "Patrick",
  "I'm a first - I was the first person in my family born in the United States. My mom is from Croatia, and my dad is from Iran. They met at music school in Belgium. I grew up as a pianist. I was really interested in piano and sort of discovered that I was a writer when I was about 13 and started writing.": "Ottessa",
  "I got started acting by going to auditions that my mom found in the entertainment section of our local news paper. Then, I got a manager and started going out on more auditions.": "Tyler",
  "What took time for my mom was getting the pronouns right and calling me by a different name. Laverne was my middle name before I transitioned.": "Laverne",
  "My first big job was an Abercrombie &Fitch campaign. But my mom wouldn't let me skip school for it, so I missed half of the shoot. When we got there, we realized Bruce Weber was the photographer; we knew we had made a mistake!": "Lauren",
  "I've been a pretty selfish mom and a very unselfish athlete for about three years now and it's time to put my family first. It's probably time to move on.": "Melanie",
  "If my mom reads that I'm grammatically incorrect I'll have hell to pay.": "Larisa",
  "My mom was a ventriloquist and she always was throwing her voice. For ten years I thought the dog was telling me to kill my father.": "Wendy",
  "Whether it's a 16-year old girl, or a mom, or a guy, or anybody, as long as they come up and they're excited to meet me 'cause they've had some sort of relationship with something I've created, it's the coolest thing ever. It never gets old. It's awesome.": "Andy",
  "I was watching 'Mr. Roger's Neighborhood', 'Sesame Street', 'Electric Company', 'Romper Room', and 'Villa Alegre!' when I said to my self, 'Hey, self! Wouldn't it be fun to be one of those kids on the TV?' My mom thought it was a pretty good idea, too... and she instantly moved us from the Bay Area to Malibu... nice.": "Keith",
  "My mom is one of my role models in a complicated way. I learned from her how to be a good mom. She was one of those natural moms who really took to it. Her chosen profession was teaching. She loves kids. But she was extremely frustrated and unhappy because for much of my life she was a stay-at-home mom.": "Leslie",
  "I definitely got my philanthropic genes from my mom and dad. They taught me from a very early age to always lend a helping hand to anyone in need, and I hope to raise my daughter to be a very kind and charitable person.": "Rebecca",
  "Mom worked as a school librarian, and she felt summers were for education.": "Patricia",
  "I was discovered in Paris when I was there on a school trip at the age of 13. After that, my mom came in contact with Elite Amsterdam; then I started modeling.": "Maud",

  "I adored my mom. I thought she was the best. I loved her very much.": "Dan",
  "I'd been on 'SVU' before and I'd been on 'Criminal Intent,' but I wasn't a follower. Like, my mom watches every episode, even before I was on it.": "Kelli",
  "My mom definitely inspires me. She's just crazy when it comes to her fashion sense.": "Lourdes",
  "When I was two and a half or three, my mom got a call from someone asking if wanted to go on an audition. I ended up getting the job; it was a commercial for Hasbro. It was my first audition and first commercial. I just had to smile and laugh and dance around.": "Megan",
  "Shortly after my dad died, my mom figured that if I could do a few commercials, I'd get a college fund.": "Liam",
  "Election days come and go. But the struggle of the people to create a government which represents all of us and not just the one percent - a government based on the principles of economic, social, racial and environmental justice - that struggle continues.": "Bernie",
  "It's not tyranny we desire; it's a just, limited, federal government.": "Alexander",
  "Government's first duty is to protect the people, not run their lives.": "Ronald",
  "A wise and frugal government, which shall restrain men from injuring one another, shall leave them otherwise free to regulate their own pursuits of industry and improvement, and shall not take from the mouth of labor the bread it has earned.": "Thomas",

  "The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next.": "Abraham",
  "Government's view of the economy could be summed up in a few short phrases: If it moves, tax it. If it keeps moving, regulate it. And if it stops moving, subsidize it.": "Ronald",
  "Unless your government is respectable, foreigners will invade your rights; and to maintain tranquillity, it must be respectable - even to observe neutrality, you must have a strong government.": "Alexander",
  "Being a patriot doesn't mean prioritizing service to government above all else.

  "Government's first duty and highest obligation is public safety.": "Arnold",
  "We were American citizens. We were incarcerated by our American government in American internment camps here in the United States. The term 'Japanese internment camp' is both grammatically and factually incorrect.": "George",
  "Unfortunately, corruption is widespread in government agencies and public enterprises. Our political system promotes nepotism and wasting money.

  "Where there is little or no public opinion, there is likely to be bad government, which sooner or later becomes autocratic government.": "William",

Doing the latter increases your exposure to government surveillance and the potential for deliberate or inadvertent breaches of your confidential files.": "Barton",
  "Governmental surveillance is not about the government collecting the information you're sharing publicly and willingly; it's about collecting the information you don't think you're sharing at all, such as the online searches you do on search engines... or private emails or text messages... or the location of your mobile phone at any time.": "Mikko",

  "What makes me angry is when people know what is right but have, over the years, attuned themselves to the fact that what they're doing, stealing money from government, is acceptable.": "Miriam",

  "A government is for the benefit of all the people.": "William",
  "I believe that the role of limited government should be looking after the needs of veterans, the elderly, children and those institutions that improve the quality of life for struggling families - I don't believe that government should bend to serve the needs of subsidized multi-national corporations and entitled billionaires.": "Moby",

  "Globalization doesn't have to be a bad thing as long as government provides us all with the tools to cope in a changing world.": "John",
  "I'm trying to fight the terrorism that's actually causing the other forms of terrorism.

  "Real prosperity comes from everybody in the country working together in a growth mode. Real prosperity comes as a result of people's own initiative and efforts and so forth. Prosperity, if it comes from the government, is not prosperity. It's an existence or a subsistence or whatever, but it isn't prosperity.": "Rush",
  "If our political leaders are to be always a lot of political merchants, they will supply any demand we may create. All we have to do is to establish a steady demand for good government.": "Lincoln",

  "If you like small government you need to work hard at having a strong national defense that is not so militant.

  "You know why there's a Second Amendment? In case the government fails to follow the first one.": "Rush",
  "Economics should be defined in terms of what it is about.

  "The Republican majority, left to its own devices from 1995 to 2000, was a party committed to limited government and restoring the balances of federalism with the states.

  "Those who want the Government to regulate matters of the mind and spirit are like men who are so afraid of being murdered that they commit suicide to avoid assassination.": "Harry",
  "Taxes are like abortion, and not just because both are grotesque procedures supported by Democrats. You're for them or against them. Taxes go up or down; government raises taxes or lowers them. But Democrats will not let the words 'abortion' or 'tax hikes' pass their lips.": "Ann",

  "Companies should be able to share specific threat information with the government without the prospect of lawsuits hanging over their head.": "Leon",

  "I have been supporting the European Union, but we are still a work in progress. We have to become more of a United States of Europe. We should talk about electing a president of the E.U., rather than having one selected from the heads of government.": "George",
  "Barack Obama likes to point to General Motors as the poster child for the job creation success of his economic policies.

  "The federal government spends millions to run the Postal Service. I could lose your mail for half of that.": "Pat",
  "What has been adjudicated and established in the wake of Vietnam and the Civil Rights movement is the ability of the press to basically write or broadcast almost anything about the government. There's very few restrictions in that way.": "Lowell",
  "The tenth amendment said the federal government is supposed to only have powers that were explicitly given in the Constitution. I think the federal government's gone way beyond that. The Constitution never said that you could have a Federal Reserve that would have $2.8 trillion in assets. We've gotten out of control.": "David",
  "The phrase 'perception is reality' is overused generally. But perception can be reality in monetary policy. The bond market doesn't act merely on what it sees. It acts on what it expects of the Fed or the government.": "Amity",

  "The more people who are dependent on government handouts, the more votes the left can depend on for an ever-expanding welfare state.": "Thomas",
  "We need an equal opportunity society, one in which government does not see its job as picking winners and losers. Where do you go if you want special favors? Government.

  "I learnt a lot in government, and I've learnt a lot since leaving government. The kind of journey of being in government is that you start at your most popular and least capable, and you end at your most capable and least popular.": "Tony",
  "Show me one dictatorship in the world that has not been supported by the United States government or some European governments. It almost doesn't exist. I think a dictatorship and hegemony are part of the same phenomenon.": "Mahmoud",
  "I don't think that much change comes from economists. I think it comes more from political realities. Probably the two giants of the 20th century, who actually did shift government policy in the U.S. and around the world, were John Maynard Keynes and Milton Friedman. I don't see anybody in our system who is at that level of influence.": "Adam",

  "Like many of his fellow skyjackers, 49-year-old Arthur Gates Barkley was motivated by a complicated grievance against the federal government. In 1963, the World War II veteran had been fired as a truck driver for a bakery, after one of his supervisors accused him of harassment.": "Brendan",
  "Feeling good about government is like looking on the bright side of any catastrophe. When you quit looking on the bright side, the catastrophe is still there.": "P.",
  "If you ask the government to solve all of your problems, it's a bit like asking your wife to cook and clean, to raise the children, to hold down a second job to help with the family finances, to keep her parents happy and well and keep your parents happy and well, and to also - to do the lawn and clean the gutters.": "P.",
  "Something that confirms all fears and many conspiracy theories about government is finding out what our elected representatives would put into law if they could.": "P.",
  "I would cap the amount of federal government can spend at 20 percent of the economy. Bring it back to 20 percent or lower. And say, we are not going to spend above that level. Democrats, they want to raise your taxes and spend more and more and turn us into an economy which is no longer driven by the private sector.": "Mitt",
  "Perhaps religious conscience upsets the designs of those who feel that the highest wisdom and authority comes from government. But from the beginning, this nation trusted in God, not man. Religious liberty is the first freedom in our Constitution.": "Mitt",
  "I think governments can't do much.": "Dalai",

  "This country has come to feel the same when Congress is in session as when the baby gets hold of a hammer.": "Will",
  "When people talked about protecting their privacy when I was growing up, they were talking about protecting it from the government. They talked about unreasonable searches and seizures, about keeping the government out of their bedrooms.": "Al",
  "Government is at its worst when you have apathy from its citizens.": "Jesse",
  "We believe a renewed commitment to limited government will unshackle our economy and create millions of new jobs and opportunities for all people, of every background, to succeed and prosper. Under this approach, the spirit of initiative - not political clout - determines who succeeds.": "Paul",
  "President Obama's reckless defense cuts that are hanging over our cloud, hanging over the horizon could put almost 44,000 jobs at stake right here in Pennsylvania. we are not going to let that happen.

  "Voters quickly forget what a man says.": "Richard",
  "When you decide to get involved in a military operation in a place like Syria, you've got to be prepared, as we learned from Iraq and Afghanistan, to become the government, and I'm not sure any country, either the United States or I don't hear of anyone else, who's willing to take on that responsibility.": "Colin",

  "If you live in a place that you perceive to be a crowded place, you appreciate government; you see it as this thing that protects you against crime, that keeps order, that makes sure that nobody puts a massage parlor next to your house, that keeps other people's dogs from pooping on the sidewalk.": "Gail",
  "Any government, that is its own judge of, and determines authoritatively for the people, what are its own powers over the people, is an absolute government of course. It has all the powers that it chooses to exercise. There is no other or at least no more accurate definition of a despotism than this.": "Lysander",

  "We've supported the U.S. every step of the way. The Philippines was the first government in Asia after September 11, in fact, the night of September 11; it was nighttime for us then.

  "For in reason, all government without the consent of the governed is the very definition of slavery.": "Jonathan",

  "We can't have democracy if we're having to protect you and our users from the government over stuff we've never had a conversation about. We need to know what the parameters are, what kind of surveillance the government is going to do, and how and why.": "Larry",

  "If we would vote in mass on the more promising ticket, or, if the two are equally bad, would throw out the party that is in, and wait till the next election and then throw out the other party that is in - then, I say, the commercial politician would feel a demand for good government and he would supply it.": "Lincoln",

  "To me, regardless of who's in office, the government is strangled by business. And the government's priorities are dictated by business.

  "A good two years after Hurricane Katrina I remember feeling so devastated and so ignorant that there was so much damage still left.

  "If I'm with a man, is that going to prevent me from achieving my goal? What sacrifices will I have to make in terms of being myself, if I'm with a man? Something that young women find out really quickly is that when you start dating, all of a sudden you're supposed to have a role. You're not allowed to just be yourself.": "Candace",

  "I used to be a real prince charming if I went on a date with a girl. But then I'd get to where I was likely to have a stroke from the stress of keeping up my act. I've since learned the key to a good date is to pay attention on her.": "Matthew",

  "It was just that we had this phenomenal honeymoon relationship that just kept on going.": "James",
  "In my experience with women that I've dated and my wife now, is you have to know what they care about. And even if you aren't a huge fan of it, you still have to have interest in it and it has to be genuine because women do it for men all the time.": "Tim",
  "I'm not old-fashioned when it comes to dating, but there's something nice about a guy pulling out a girl's chair and opening the door for her, even if it's just in the beginning.": "Lauren",
  "Good-looking individuals are treated better than homely ones in virtually every social situation, from dating to trial by jury.": "Martha",
  "The prospect of dating someone in her twenties becomes less appealing as you get older. At some point in your life, your tolerance level goes down and you realize that, with someone much younger, there's nothing really to talk about.": "Clint",

  "It's just me and my 6-month-old puppy. I am not dating anyone.": "Bridget",
  "I have an urge to communicate. I think I'm a change from what it would be like dating a normal guy who doesn't talk too much.": "Drake",
  "I had a crazy life for a teenager. I lived in New Jersey, but I'd go to Vermont for three weeks, join a commune, take pictures with the guy I was dating, come back home, and post photos.": "Halsey",
  "I like the bad-boy types. Generally the guy I'm attracted to is the guy in the club with all the tattoos and nail polish. He's usually the lead singer in a punk band and plays guitar. But my serious boyfriends are relatively clean-cut, nice guys. So it's strange.": "Megan",
  "Watching your daughter being collected by her date feels like handing over a million dollar Stradivarius to a gorilla.": "Jim",
  "If you kiss on the first date and it's not right, then there will be no second date. Sometimes it's better to hold out and not kiss for a long time. I am a strong believer in kissing being very intimate, and the minute you kiss, the floodgates open for everything else.": "Jennifer",
  "When you really don't like a guy, they're all over you, and as soon as you act like you like them, they're no longer interested.": "Beyonce",
  "I had a few dating disasters along the way with girls cheating on me. One girl was the inspiration for me singing 'Cry Me A River' on 'The X Factor.' That was my payback to her because she was unfaithful.": "Liam",
  "We all prospect, and don't even know we're doing it. When you start the dating process, you are actually prospecting for the person you want to marry. When you're interviewing employees, you are prospecting for someone who will best fit your needs.": "Zig",
  "I was a weird teenager. My mother was actually worried because I didn't have any interest in dating in my teenage years. I had all this desire to pursue my passions like ballet, then sailing, then music, so I didn't have any emptiness to fill.": "Kiesza",
  "Celebrities say they date other celebrities because they have the same job. But I think they just like dating famous people. Celebrities attract each other, like cattle.": "Jason",
  "A simple compliment goes a really long way - for a guy to just come over and say, 'You have great hair' or 'I really like your dress,' and then just smile and walk away. That's a great move, because he's sort of putting himself out there by doing that, but it won't lead to any embarrassment if the girl isn't interested.": "Stacy",

  "As far as the men who are running for president are concerned, they aren't even people I would date.": "Nora",

  "It seems essential, in relationships and all tasks, that we concentrate only on what is most significant and important.": "Soren",
  "I prefer ordinary girls - you know, college students, waitresses, that sort of thing. Most of the girls I go out with are just good friends. Just because I go out to the cinema with a girl, it doesn't mean we are dating.": "Leonardo",
  "I don't know any of us who are in relationships that are totally honest - it doesn't exist.": "Richard",
  "I've dated some women who have turned me on to some funny things that are strange for men to actually do, but these things have become part of my process. I think the things I do for my appearance help make me look better. I even colour my hair because I like how it makes me look.": "Ryan",
  "To find a prince, you gotta kiss some toads.": "Foxy",
  "It's ironic, really. Guys should be excited that I got Kristen Bell. If Brad Pitt gets Kristen Bell, it's like, 'Well, of course he did.' With me, it should be, 'Oh good, a normal-looking guy got her. Maybe I'll get me a Kristen Bell.' But guys hate my guts for always dating women I have no right to be with.": "Dax",
  "Workshops and seminars are basically financial speed dating for clueless people.": "Douglas",
  "Coming through the fire and through the storm of life with a strong man, my fiance Ashanti, whom I've been dating for eight months and two wonderful children beside me, I'm just so happy that I have been able to maintain my integrity and get to where I am today with the right energy around me.": "Angie",
  "Pamela Anderson Lee released a statement confirming that she has had her breast implants removed. Doctors say that Pamela is doing fine and that her old implants are now dating Charlie Sheen.": "Conan",
  "Dating has taught me what I want and don't want, who I am, and who I want to be.": "Jennifer",
  "Honestly, my dating life according to the tabloids is very exciting, and the most hilarious thing is that it's nowhere near as exciting as the tabloids have ever made it out to be.": "Margot",
  "For a lot of the time I was in Berkeley, I was single. I was living in a kind of collegiate apartment by myself - it was like a protracted summer vacation. So at least in hindsight, I have gloomy emotions attached to Berkeley, whereas I started coming to New York because I was dating someone, and it was very exciting and romantic.": "Adrian",
  "I enjoy dating. I love first dates. I think they're incredibly fascinating studies in human psychology. When you sit down across from someone on a first date and things are going alright, you talk objectives. We want to win each other over, so how do you win someone over? You have to put the best foot forward.": "Chris",
  "A seersucker suit is one of the most iconic styles dating from the 1920s and is still a gentleman's best bet when it's hot and sticky.": "Roger",
  "Anybody I'm dating, I don't want them to talk about my music. I don't talk about my music to them.": "Nas",
  "As and when I get into a relationship, I'll flaunt her to the world. I'm looking for a soul mate, and in any case, I'm not very much for casual dating. I'm such a simple guy away from this dating-shating business.": "Suresh",
  "When I was in high school, the genders were so separate from each other. If you weren't 'dating' somebody, you couldn't just be friends with somebody.": "S.",
  "I heard on public radio recently, there's a thing called Weed Dating. Singles get together in a garden and weed and then they take turns, they keep matching up with other people. Two people will weed down one row and switch over with two other people. It's in Vermont. I don't think I'd be very good at Weed Dating.": "Roy",
  "It's a big responsibility dating me. Because I come with a little bit of baggage, you know?": "Demi",
  "I'm not cynical about marriage or romance. I enjoyed being married. And although being single was fun for a while, there was always the risk of dating someone who'd owned a lunch box with my picture on it.": "Shaun",
  "No matter how love-sick a woman is, she shouldn't take the first pill that comes along.": "Joyce",
  "I can't even explain to you how terrible that feels, that I equate dating a woman with punishment, shame, guilt, disappointment, reproach, reprimand, persecution. It's a nightmare.": "John",
  "I urge you children to be patient with your parents. If they seem to be out of touch on such vital issues as dating, clothing styles, modern music, and use of family cars, listen to them anyway. They have the experience that you lack.": "Joseph",
  "I've always been intellectually restless, but it is the building part of it that most interests me. It is the constructing of the team that is my favorite part. Anyone who is familiar with the history of the A's franchise, even dating back to Philadelphia, knows that every five or 10 years, you have to tear it apart and rebuild it.": "Billy",
  "The funniest thing is I never understood why actors were so shady about who they're dating. Then I realized the things you say get printed and the people you're involved with read them. That's what's tricky. Nothing goes unnoticed. I don't want to get myself in trouble!": "Emily",
  "Whenever I date a guy, I think, 'Is this the man I want my children to spend their weekends with?'": "Rita",
  "I've been dating since I was fifteen. I'm exhausted. Where is he?": "Kristin",
  "Thank God I never got in a fight. All of the jock dudes hated me, but all of their girlfriends thought I was nice so they wouldn't touch me. It was infuriating to them.": "Mark",
  "Dating is fun. It's light: There's courting; there's the interesting, exciting text messaging and flirting. There's no weight. When you start getting into relationships, you really start having to consider each other in your lives, and I think that's really important.": "Denise",
  "As I've told Tyler, there's not a really easy place between being single and being married for us now. We're just so busy that the logistics of our career make dating impossible. I think I'll find a girl at some point that makes all of the extra work and effort that needs to be put into it worth it. But for right now, I just date my drums.": "Josh",
  "I believe that often people even stay in bad relationships longer than they should because the fear of the pain of dating is scarier than the pain of a bad relationship!": "Karen",
  "The earliest example known to me of replaced body parts is exemplified by a Mayan skull dating back to 1400 BC. In this skull, false teeth made of stone had been implanted.": "John",
  "Rumors about me? Calista Flockhart, Pam Anderson, and Matt Damon. That's who I'm dating.": "Ben",
  "Right now I'm pretty single... My career is my boyfriend.": "Christina",
  "Which is, I'm an optimist that two people can be together to work out their conflicts. And that commitment, I think, might be what love is, because they both grow from their relationship.": "Garry",
  "Practically all the relationships I know are based on a foundation of lies and mutually accepted delusion.": "Kim",
  "I'm quite sensitive to women. I saw how my sister got treated by boyfriends. I read this thing that said when you are in a relationship with a woman, imagine how you would feel if you were her father. That's been my approach, for the most part.": "Orlando",
  "I change my mind so much I need two boyfriends and a girlfriend.": "Pink",
  "The sea hath fish for every man.": "William",
  "You'll never catch a man if you let him think you are too smart.": "Anna",
  "My philosophy of dating is to just fart right away.": "Jenny",
  "I was dating a guy that was a huge wrestling fan and I'm embarrassed to say it now but I used to make fun of him for watching it.": "Torrie",
  "I want my audience to know me for my work, not because of who I'm dating or what drugs I'm on or what club I went to.": "Shia",
  "I don't talk about who I'm dating because when you break up, you wind up reliving it in the media.": "Bridget",
  "Well, dating has become a sport and not about finding the person you love.": "Rashida",
  "The rich are different. Their wants are very high maintenance. They'll pick eye color and hair color, all the way down to what she does for a living, what school she went to. Their list can be extremely long. But at the end of the day, dating is dating, because they're human beings.": "Patti",
  "Dating in Los Angeles can be hard, which makes it all the better when you meet a really nice guy.": "Lauren",
  "I've never tried to pass myself off as anything more than a comedian who wrote a dating book.": "Greg",
  "When it comes to dating, I'm straightforward and traditional with a twist.": "Luke",
  "Even though many couples are choosing to marry later in life, our laws haven't been updated to address dating partner abuse.": "Gabrielle",
  "When I was a boy, I took over the shed at the bottom of the garden and displayed fossils and potsherds and coins in it and proudly called it my 'museum'. I charged people to come in, and my most prized possession was a Saracen shield dating from the Crusades.": "Kevin",
  "There are some guys you definitely would not want dating your sister - especially hockey players.": "Patrick",
  "With the release of her fourth album, 'Red,' in 2012 and a handful of highly publicized romances, Taylor was criticized by the press and other entertainers for such sinful acts as dating people and writing songs about it, gaining a reputation as boy-crazy and love-ridden.": "Tavi",
  "I like the idea of dating, but I'm not dating anyone exclusively, particularly right now. It's hard to be in a relationship unless you're ready to go public with it. So it's a lot easier for me to not be in a relationship. I really don't want that part of my life to be tabloid fodder.": "Cory",
  "For me, I've learned if I want a very stable, normal relationship, where I'll be like, 'Okay, this is nice, I know what's going to happen in a month,' it's probably better to date outside the industry. But you can't help who you fall for. It's our dating pool.": "Camila",
  "Taylor Swift dates guys so she can write a breakup song about them. I don't think she's dating for love - I think she's dating for creativity. So let's get her off the market and put her in dating detox. If she really wants love, she has to stop writing music about them.": "Patti",
  "I'm doin' something different. I mean, I talk a little bit about race and interracial dating, but it's not the heart of my act. I just try to do what I think is funny; there's no huge message or through line.": "Hannibal",
  "That's the awful thing about dating. Tight underwear. We would all like to be in a big bra and pants and when you are in a secure relationship you can do that.": "Dawn",
  "You know, I had my mother and my father convincing me that he would be going back to Hollywood and he'd be back with the actresses and dating them and that he wasn't serious about me at all. So I had him saying one thing to me and my parents telling me something else.": "Priscilla",
  "If you cry over a guy, then your friends can't date him. It can't even be considered.": "Taylor",
  "I'm not the girl who always has a boyfriend. I'm the girl who rarely has a boyfriend.": "Taylor",
  "I'm the girl who - I call it girl-next-door-itis - the hot guy is friends with and gets all his relationship advice from but never considers dating.": "Taylor",
  "You can draw inspiration from anything. If you're a good storyteller, you can take a dirty look somebody gives you, or if a guy you used to have flirtations with starts dating a new girl, or somebody you're casually talking to says something that makes you so mad - you can create an entire scenario around that.": "Taylor",
  "I'm typically single. I'm the girl who - I call it girl-next-door-itis - the hot guy is friends with and gets all his relationship advice from but never considers dating.": "Taylor",
  "I'm really critical of my posture, it makes a big difference. And I try to suck my belly in. Everyone should do that whether you're on a red carpet or not. Even if you're just going out to dinner with your boyfriend you should try and suck it in.": "Katy",
  "I just don't like when there's a rumor that says I'm dating someone who is below my standards. But when I got divorced, my ex-wife said I was spending all my time with Lindsay Lohan and Angelina Jolie. I was like, 'Thank you for the big ups!'": "Marilyn",
  "Our countries have been friends dating to the very existence of the United States. France is the only power that has never been at war with the United States.": "Marine",
  "'Dating Game' wasn't social commentary, political analysis, Shakespearean-level drama or even blunt-force comedy. It was just the televised equivalent of meeting someone at a bar. But it appealed to our most basic Darwinian instinct: selecting a good mate. You can't go wrong when a show's premise is hard-wired into human DNA.": "Seth",
  "Ever since the infamous quiz show scandals of the 1950s, the feds had insisted that TV game shows be honest - or that at least they didn't cheat. So as a 'Dating Game' bachelor, I didn't know what I was going to be asked. The other bachelors and I were required to concoct our answers in real time.": "Seth",
  "I think that we all have to have that rite of passage of dating the tortured artist who seems cooler than we think we are; we aspire to be like them, and we're excited that somebody is turning us on to new music or a new lifestyle.": "Drew",
  "I tried to tell them about the dating process because I'm single now and how horrible it is and how many foolish experiences I had had dating. So I was really selling him hard, but the whole time he really wanted me!": "Andie",
  "I do like dating cynics - they tend to be incredibly funny.": "Chris",
  "The first time I was pregnant, Kanye and I were dating, and I was just being introduced to the world of fashion. I wanted to work with a bunch of different stylists, and when you work with a new stylist, everyone wants to possess your look.": "Kim",
  "I started dating JD Samson from Le Tigre, and suddenly I was listening to more up-tempo music and old dance music, like ESG and Gang of Four, and I thought, 'Wow. This is fun.'": "Sia",
  "First and foremost when you're doing comedy, you gotta be relevant and applicable to the times that you're living in. When you try and just do comedy about who is dating who and lifestyle jokes, it gets tiring after a while. It's hard to be funny in that realm.": "Adam",
  "I know some people who've gotten tattoos that they probably shouldn't have, like the name of somebody they were dating, and that never ends well.": "Nikki",
  "I grew up in the world of bad television, on my dad's sets and then as a young schmuck on dating shows and so on.": "George",
  "Smallpox, which spreads by respiration and kills roughly one in three of those infected, took hundreds of millions of lives during a recorded history dating to Pharaonic Egypt. The last case was in 1978, and the disease was declared eradicated on May 8, 1980.": "Barton",
  "When I started dating I had this kind of Romeo and Juliet, fateful romantic idea about love which was almost that you were a victim and there was a lot of pain involved and that was how it should be.": "Emma",
  "Good-looking individuals are treated better than homely ones in virtually every social situation, from dating to trial by jury. If everyday experience hasn't convinced you of this, there's research that will.": "Martha",
  "Golf and dating don't mix.": "Larry",
  "I was single for a while and dating and... I just didn't know how to do it! I've always been like that: when I was 15, there was a guy I liked, and we made out, and I thought that meant he was my boyfriend.": "Winona",
  "My parents always looked like they loved being together. That's what I took from them, and that's how my wife and I are. I still feel like we're dating.": "Billy",
  "I'm not a dating person.": "Kourtney",
  "You like someone, you court each other, you get into a relationship. You're answerable to each other. Whereas, the non-answerability of dating, my God, I don't know if I would ever be able to.": "Priyanka",
  "I was dating girls who were actresses, and that was fun, so I took a playwriting class. But that was short-lived. That was one year. Around that time, I was seeing movies that were making me think in terms of images.": "Richard",
  "When I was first divorced, I started dating younger women, and it was really exciting. But after a while I was like, 'This is just dumb.'": "Louis",
  "I don't really believe in rules, but I do like old-fashioned dating where you don't call the guy until he calls you. I don't think it's like he's got to do this and that's the rule.": "Ashley",
  "I give dating advice on a regular basis. It's not that I'm any expert, but it's always nice to share that with your friends.": "Ashley",
  "I'm definitely old-school when it comes to dating. I'm not into the 'game' so much. If I like you, I'll confront you and be open about it. Then I expect you to come after me.": "Ashley",
  "When you start dating another country star, the first question is, 'When are y'all gonna do a duet?' And what sucks about that is people expect you to do it whether you want to or not.": "Blake",
  "I hate dates. It becomes a weird auditioning process. And I've never had normal dating.": "Juliette",
  "Things were a lot simpler in Detroit. I didn't care about anything but boyfriends.": "Madonna",
  "I've never been Romeo who meets a girl and falls for her immediately. It's been a much slower process for me each time I've gone into a relationship.": "Leonardo",
  "I'm never going to say anything about who I'm dating unless I'm married or engaged.": "Kirsten",
  "I came out to my parents when I was a junior in college. And it was pretty fine. They were more concerned with why I wasn't dating anyone. But now I'm 36, and I still don't date anyone.": "Billy",
  "There are big parts of my life that I don't share. I don't share myself eating dinner with my family. I don't talk about who I'm dating. That's private that's me. ": "Ansel",
  "I'm very happy to be part of a generation where you don't have to say that you're gay. It's just like, 'I'm dating a dude,' or, 'I'm dating a girl,' and I love it. I think it's a great time.": "Keke",
  "I don't have the best dating track record.": "Lauren",
  "Dating is all about the chase. It's fun!": "Lauren",
  "I think, at the end of the day, age is just a number. It's like, in real life, I've got friends who are dating someone their age or dating someone who's twice their age, and they're equally in love.": "Margot",
  "The thing about dating someone who listens to a totally different genre than you is they can help you find things to appreciate in that genre.": "Hannah",
  "I guess there are all these women with a big secret - they're hiding men they are ashamed of. They come up to me and say: 'I've been dating this guy for six months in secret but none of my friends know. I can't give him up even though he's embarrassing.'": "Hannah",
  "When someone is good, but it doesn't seem like their world will collapse if they don't get the part, it's more appealing. It's like dating someone: You don't want someone who's too into you.": "Steve",
  "Dating is... weird.": "Jennifer",
  "I have 20,000 girlfriends, all around the world.": "Justin",
  "When my parents were dating, they were very poor, so my dad couldn't take my mom out. They would go to the grocery store and pick out funny looking vegetables. When I grew up, we'd still go and find the ones with personality.": "Parker",
  "I don't understand the whole dating thing. I know right off the bat if I'm interested in someone, and I don't want them to waste their money on me and take me out to eat if I know I'm not interested in that person.": "Britney",
  "I have a distinct memory, dating back to 1989 or so, of sitting around with my college dorm mates talking about a new term that was popping up everywhere: 'political correctness.'": "Meghan",
  "Julianne Moore and Michael Keaton began in 1980s soap operas and 1970s sitcoms, respectively, such ancient history by show business standards that you need carbon dating to measure their careers.": "Steve",
  "People say, 'Just say who you're dating. Then people will stop being so ravenous about it.' It's like, No they won't! They'll ask for specifics.": "Kristen",
  "I wouldn't tell you anything about anybody I cared about because it becomes entertainment for other people, and it sort of just cheapens everything in your life. I would never tell you if I was dating anybody.": "Kristen",
  "I hate being the heartbreaker. Hate it. If I date somebody and it doesn't work out, it's another nightmare for me.": "John",
  "All men that date me have to know that their name may end up in a pop song.": "Kesha",
  "Dating, like almost every other male-female interaction in present-day society, is based on outmoded and unequal social roles and expectations.": "Lynn",
  "I learned how quickly I could go from having never met someone to having the world think I'm dating them.": "Halsey",
  "I'm a fixer, unfortunately. I'm like, 'Oh, I can fix you.' But it's not just guys I'm dating anymore. It's this entire legion of young girls who tell me they need me to maintain any sort of sanity or peace.": "Halsey",
  "It's lonely. That's why, in many ways, the CIA is the world's biggest dating agency, I think. I imagine it's much like two actors that get married because they understand that universe. You know, I'm pretty sure the agency's divorce rate is rather high.": "Valerie",
  "We have known Hillary Clinton both professionally and personally for close to 20 years, dating back to before President Bill Clinton's first trip to Africa in 1998 - a trip that they both acknowledge changed their lives and gave considerable meaning to their post-White House years and to the activities of the Clinton Foundation.": "Valerie",
  "I'm dating myself by saying this, but I was the test audience for 'Space Invaders.' I remember when that was the first game that wasn't a pinball game. I spent a lot of money on 'Space Invaders,' in the form of quarters, of course.": "John",
  "I'm a South Asian female that talks about relationships and periods and dating and all these things.": "Lilly",
  "The thing is, in the dating profiles it says 'spiritual,' but not with a specific religion. And so I pretty much try to meditate, but I have a very hard time concentrating on things other than me.": "Lisa",
  "I'm way too famous and rich to be on a dating app, but if I get very desperate by the time I'm 60, I'll go on Tinder. Or I'll go on 'Millionaire Matchmaker'; I'll call Patti Stanger.": "Lisa",
  "I don't really talk about my personal life. It's a strange and funny and weird thing. Sometimes you have a conversation with someone and the paparazzi snaps a picture of you and people decide you're dating. If I try to answer everything people say, I would be up all night.": "Tracee",
  "In this day and age, I ask anyone I date right away: 'Are you married? Are you in a relationship with anyone? Does anyone think they're in a relationship with you?' And by the way, if someone says, 'Yes, I am dating other people,' that's not necessarily a deal breaker. But you have to communicate it, not hide it.": "Tracee",
  "The best companies in the world have all had predecessors. 'YouTube' was a dating site. You always have to evolve into something else.": "Kevin",
  "I'm not great at dating, but I need to do it to relax.": "Lena",
  "All my freakouts have been pretty private and directed at family pets and/or people I have been dating for too short a time to freak out at in that way.": "Lena",
  "For a long time, I had a crazy girl dating habit.": "Eli",
  "The best dating advice I can give is... are you going in it for marriage, or are you going in it for just a date? You've got to be open about it right away, because the other person could be in it for marriage, but you're not.": "Kendra",
  "I remembered, like, when 'Not When My Daughter' came out, I'm serious, I think dating for Iranian men became a lot harder. Dude's name, Shahrokh - became Tony. Mehsud became Mike.": "Maz",
  "I'm much more interested in what an actor has to say about something substantial and important than who they're dating or what clothes they're wearing or some other asinine, insignificant aspect of their life.": "Ben",
  "I'm not very experienced with boys or the whole dating thingy.": "Vanessa",
  "Dating in college and dating in Hollywood are actually really similar in that the relationships don't last long. Other than that, lots of people in Hollywood tend to be narcissistic, and it's hard to have a relationship with someone like that.": "Julia",
  "I always hated high-school shows and high-school movies, because they were always about the cool kids. It was always about dating and sex, and all the popular kids, and the good-looking kids. And the nerds were super-nerdy cartoons, with tape on their glasses. I never saw 'my people' portrayed accurately.": "Paul",
  "Dating is kind of hard. Like dinner or something like that. Like a forced awkward situation is very strange. Especially for me, for some reason.": "Zac",
  "My wife and I got engaged in New Hampshire at this lake house that her family's had forever, and it's on Lake Winnipesaukee. And so we went there every summer as we were dating.": "Jimmy",
  "I think more dating stuff is scheduling. It's needing people who understand your work schedule.": "Jennifer",
  "Mary Tyler Moore was a working woman whose story lines were not always about dating and men. They were about work friendships and relationships, which is what I feel my adult life has mostly been about.": "Tina",
  "Humans have continued to evolve quite a lot over the past ten thousand years, and certainly over 100 thousand. Sure, our biology affects our behavior. But it's unlikely that humans' early evolution is deeply relevant to contemporary psychological questions about dating or the willpower to complete a dissertation.": "Annalee",
  "I have no dating life.": "Sara",
  "Back when I was dating, the dreaded C word was Commitment. As soon as most men found out I had a child, they ran. If I ever got close enough to say the words, 'I love you,' they ran faster.": "Regina",
  "My boyfriend and I are not good at fighting. We're better than we were when we started dating - two breakups and three years ago - but it's never come naturally to either of us. I have often wished we fought like I imagine Pink and Carey Hart fight.": "Nikki",
  "I don't have much experience, but the few times when I would go on a date with a girl - like when I was 12 - there was a lot of sharing, and a lot of talking, and a lot of asking how I am. They thought we were dating, and I was sort of hoping to meet their brothers.": "Anderson",
  "Women need to know that not all guys are going to hurt them the way that the guy did before they started dating me. I know guys I wouldn't go out with.": "Garry",
  "I'm honest about the journey I've been on, so I definitely don't take dating lightly anymore.": "Demi",
  "Women were very, very good at 'Pong'. It was part of the dating scene. The number of people who told me they met their wife or husband playing 'Pong' was huge. They were shoulder to shoulder, talking and playing. It was body contact and verbal contact.": "Nolan",
  "I dated dozens of young men, had fun with all, made commitments to none.": "Gene",
  "I'm very open to dating and finding a guy.": "Kristin",
  "I did Internet dating for a while, and that is rife with horrible dating stories.": "Allison",
  "I've been dating since I was 15 years old, and I just don't seem to do it well.": "Harvey",
  "As far as dating is concerned, I'm not a casual dating person.": "Divyanka",
  "When I first got started in this whole world of online connecting, we were combating this antiquated stereotype of who used online dating, and we really set out to make it popular with millennials. What I find to be so fascinating now is, I'm seeing an inverse in that trend.": "Whitney",
  "I personally have always hated dating. I was never vulnerable or insecure in any part of my life, but I would become that way with a guy because they have control, according to society, when it comes to dating.": "Whitney",
  "Everyone in the dating business wants to know what women want - it's the billion-dollar question. But it's simple: put one in charge, and you find out.": "Whitney",
  "I truly believe that what we're seeing with online dating is very similar to what happened with the Myspace-Facebook era, where Myspace was once this place for online connecting for a very select group of young people. And then Facebook kind of hit at this moment where it was acceptable for everybody to do it.": "Whitney",
  "When I left Tinder, I had no intention of getting back into the dating industry. What I ultimately wanted to do was start this contagious complimentary social network, where kindness was at the helm.": "Whitney",
  "There's nothing wrong with taking yourself out of the dating pool. You don't need to be in a relationship because that's what society expects of you or because your grandmother thinks you need to be married by a certain date. Those days are over. Instead, take a step back and say, 'I'm OK alone.'": "Whitney",
  "When you're setting up your dating profile, choose the photos according to who you are today. A variety of recent shots that are a true representation of your character.": "Whitney",
  "A bachelor never quite gets over the idea that he is a thing of beauty and a boy forever.": "Helen",
  "Up until age 40, most men are just not as mature as women. So, it makes sense that a lot of women date up in age a bit.": "Patti",
  "I have put gay dating on the map.": "Patti",
  "I just thank God my husband and I found each other before the advent of social media. I can't imagine dating someone and seeing what they're doing on their Facebook page. And people breaking up with each other over texts now? We had to break up with each other face to face back then.": "Jen",
  "I'm very heterosexual, so dating women is something I'm not ashamed of. But my love life is not as exciting as it is reported to be.": "Ranbir",
  "I'm a fabulous date, I make sure I look good, I like hearing what a guy has to say and I make sure the evening is a real laugh. I like to laugh.": "Eva",
  "You don't need to know who I'm dating. You don't need to know what I'm doing. I'm fine with everybody not knowing that.": "Eva",
  "I don't know why anyone would want to ask an actor for dating advice. We are not the poster children for healthy relationships.": "Ginnifer",
  "I'm so an all-or-nothing person in dating, always. I'm big on not wasting time. And so, yeah, if something's not working, it's time to not hold people back.": "Ginnifer",
  "What does 'dating' mean? I don't know. I couldn't say.": "Catherine",
  "I don't like going out on a date unless I know the broad a little bit beforehand. By the way, 'broad' to me is not a detrimental term for women; it's simply another word for female. Anyway, I don't really go out a whole lot, because there aren't many girls I like to take out and spend a whole evening with - at least not an evening in public.": "Joe",
  "Dating is really hard because everyone puts on a front. It's really difficult to see who is who, so it is important to be yourself.": "Brooke",
  "The Bachelor'... and 'The Bachelorette'... and 'Bachelor in Paradise'... and the 'After the Final Rose ceremony'. I love a competition dating show.": "Erin",
  "I have run from a lot of relationships in favor of being alone. And I tend to find men who use their money and status as a dating tool to be unattractive.": "Erin",
  "I've never dated anywhere else, so I only know L.A. dating, and I wouldn't wish it upon my worst enemy. I've pulled back and taken the pressure off of myself to figure it out, because there's so much pressure about status that dating has become this game where you pull out all your tricks.": "Erin",
  "Stuff about me dating Kim Kardashian - I have no idea where that came from and all these other rumors. I don't think I'm that type.": "Jeremy",
  "Comedy helped me out in my teenage years. It saw me through puberty and helped me to deal with dating.": "Rhys",
  "In Indonesia, where I am from, the Dutch-imposed Civil Code dating back to the colonial 1870s prevailed until the 1974 Law on Marriage granted married women greater rights, including the ability to open individual bank accounts.": "Sri",
  "I can't imagine dating a boy, meeting him only outside the home. What's a home and family for if it's not the center of one's life?": "Loretta",
  "A month alone would make me so happy. Not good for my dating prospects.": "Barry",
  "My husband, after two weeks of dating, asked me, if our relationship were to work out, would I be OK with our first boy being named Ace.": "Jennie",
  "I was a late starter on the romantic front. I didn't start dating until I was in my 30s.": "Geri",
  "I think audiences can relate to the guys I'm playing, those large-and-in-charge idiots. Or maybe I just make them feel better about who they are, or who they're dating.": "Rob",
  "I don't really comment on my personal life because I feel like any comment at all is opening up a whole can of worms. I'd just rather not talk about who I'm dating.": "Josh",
  "I'm often dating people, but I don't say it because you sort of know it won't last long.": "Graham",
  "Kathie Lee and I were working together on our 'Live' morning show when she started dating Frank. I always loved trying to get her to tell me about her new romance, and it wasn't long before we were watching them take their vows in front of close friends in Southhampton.": "Regis",
  "Dodi got a lot of criticism when he began dating Princess Diana. No one seemed to think he was good enough for her.": "Lorna",
  "I put my family first, and that's why for a long time, you didn't see me dating or hear about me dating or hear about me out. I had other focuses in my life, and that would be my family and my work.": "Kimora",
  "OKCupid's model is almost entirely based on advertising, which is the way most online media is monetized these days, whether it's the news or whether it's sports, and we think online dating is going to evolve in the exact same way.": "Sam",
  "I think for marketplace businesses, and when you think about online dating, it's not a social network. It's not a place where you go to talk to people you already know; it's a place you go to interact with someone you've never met before.": "Sam",
  "The sort of the most efficient way for online dating marketplace to evolve and, in fact, any marketplace to evolve is to have one really big market where people can enter and exit as they please, where people have really advanced search, sort, and filtering technology.": "Sam",
  "When you're thinking about building your own online dating profile, especially on OkCupid, you should go through the same steps you're thinking about when you're going out to meet someone new. You want to put your best foot forward.": "Sam",
  "Your goal in an online dating profile and in your first message to somebody is to strike up a conversation.": "Sam",
  "We sold OkCupid to Match in January of 2011. In September of 2012, I became CEO of all of Match, which is the operating segment of IAC that contains all of the dating properties.": "Sam",
  "I get to be the nosiest friend or acquaintance that anyone has because it's - my job is to ask you about your dating life all the time.": "Sam",
  "My friends and the people I know understand that I'm going to ask them what they're doing, how they're dating, who they're dating, where they're going and what they're doing. I'm constantly asking those questions and making sure I'm in touch with the customer.": "Sam",
  "One thing matters more than anything else for a dating product, and that is the quantity and quality of the people who use the product. It's really freaking hard to get critical mass.": "Sam",
  "We were intrigued by the fact that we had so much actual behavior among people on our dating site, OKCupid.": "Sam",
  "My work involves online dating, but I believe almost every behavior exhibited online has an offline corollary. Really, the medium doesn't change human nature.": "Sam",
  "Dating is a numbers game. What we try to promise is good first dates. Once that first date happens, it's really up to you.": "Sam",
  "When people talk about the impact of mobile dating, everyone focuses on real-time meeting - this idea that my pocket will vibrate every time a hot girl walks by. That's important. But it's not transformative.": "Sam",
  "In dating, the question is how many Tinder knockoffs are we going to have, and are any of them going to take off?": "Sam",
  "I didn't want to be short. I've tried to pretend that being a short guy didn't matter. I tried to make up for being short by affecting a strut, by adopting the voice of a much bigger man, by spending more money than I made, by tipping double or triple at bars and restaurants, by dating tall, beautiful women.": "Mickey",
  "I tried to make up for being 5 ft. 3 in. by affecting a strut and adopting the voice of a much bigger man... dating tall, beautiful women... But nothing I could do, after Ava had left me, would add a single inch to my height.": "Mickey",
  "When men I have dated over the years whined about, 'Oh, you make no time for me' - see ya! I just dumped them. I don't need that pressure in my life.": "Rachael",
  "Dating co-stars is natural. When you're working with someone, it's habit.": "Rachel",
  "Appearance is something you should definitely consider when you're going out. Have your girlfriend clip your nails or something like that.": "Usher",
  "Last year my boyfriend gave me a painting - a very personal one. I really prefer personal gifts or ones made by someone for me. Except diamonds. That's the exception to the rule.": "Minnie",
  "If you don't have a valentine, hang out with your girlfriends, don't go looking for someone. When it's right, they'll come to you.": "Carmen",
  "Am I still interested in a guy's body? Now that I have grown up, I am much more of a 'vibe' kind of person! If a man has a good body, that is an added plus.": "Carmen",
  "'Christian Mingle' is about a young, modern, single woman. She's trying to achieve it all - a successful career, amazing friends, and finding Mr. Right. She stumbles into the world of online dating looking for an instant 'soul mate solution,' but ultimately ends up taking a personal journey transforming her life.": "Corbin",
  "I've never been speed dating! I sort of wish I had, just for the experience of it.": "America",
  "I think that dating other musicians can be complicated at times. Especially when they think highly of themselves.": "Nick",
  "I've had a little bad, bad media luck the new year. Well, apparently I'm dating Bill Clinton, which makes me nervous. I didn't know, though.": "Julie",
  "Insider trading by hedge funds has a long and distinguished history, dating to the days when people didn't know that there was such a thing as a hedge fund.": "Gary",
  "I'm representing the single women out there, dating around, trying to find the right guy who respects you and appreciates you. Maybe I'll settle down somewhere. Gotta keep looking.": "Madchen",
  "I was dating my first boyfriend in high school for a long time, and we broke up before prom. I hadn't met anyone else that I really wanted to go with, and my friends have always been amazing. So I went with my friends and got a million photos with them!": "Shay",
  "I've had two romances since moving to Las Vegas. One was with somebody 12 years older than me, and the other was the same age, and neither worked out. I know people still think of me as one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends, and he of course was much older than me, but that was a whole different lifestyle and a different kind of dating.": "Holly",
  "It's weird, I never wish anything bad upon anybody, except two or three old girlfriends.": "Carrot",
  "I like to think I'll just be walking down the street one day and stop and meet someone, like, 'Oh my God, you're awesome,' and then we start dating.": "Laura",
  "I suppose I was a little bit of what would be called today a nerd. I didn't have girlfriends, and really I wasn't a very social boy.": "Charles",
  "I don't actually watch that much TV, but I was obsessed with 'Dawson's Creek' growing up. And 'Freaks and Geeks.' And '8 Simple Rules for Dating My Teenage Daughter.'": "Anya",
  "That's the miracle of Amazon! It's like Internet dating. In the early days, you could get slimed as an author on Amazon by someone bearing a grudge, or jealous, or whatever. And because there were so few reviews posted, this stank.": "Nigel",
  "While actors are great and awesome, writers literally create new worlds from scratch. What is sexier than that? Personally, I don't know why every last person out there isn't dating a writer.": "Rachel",
  "The woman I am currently crazy about was a vegetarian for a year until I started dating her. As is the case with most vegetarians, she had never eaten properly prepared meat, only commercially packaged or otherwise abused flesh.": "Steve",
  "I'd been dating my husband for about a year, and I'd already kissed George Clooney, Ashton Kutcher and Gerard Butler. Awesome year, right?": "Judy",
  "Some women flirt more with what they say, and some with what they do.": "Anna",
  "All my life, men have told me I wasn't pretty enough - even the men I was dating. And I'd be like, 'Well, why are you with me, then?' It's always been men putting me down just like my dad. To this day when someone says I'm cute, I can't see it. I don't see it no matter what anybody says.": "Lil'",
  "The United States has a long tradition of preserving the all-American outdoor experience, dating back to the days of President Theodore Roosevelt.": "Sarah",
  "I have a Tinder account. Now I've done Bumble, and I've tried this other one, and the way I justified it is that... because I'm on TV, I shouldn't be eliminated from participating in what's going on in the world. But people are always like, 'I can't believe you're on a dating app!'": "Eric",
  "I ain't scared to do another dating show, but I ain't really trying to. I want to do a talk show or something. I've done enough dating on television. I'm ready to spread my wings, and go down other avenues.": "Flavor",
  "Wells Fargo's internal review only covers unauthorized accounts dating back to 2011. News reports and court documents suggest these problems might have existed long before then. The 2013 'Los Angeles Times' articles led to the L.A. city attorney's office investigation into Wells Fargo's sales practices.": "Richard",
  "I don't have dating tips.": "Bill",
  "Who would want to get back together with Taylor Swift after having dated her? I'm sure dating her is like talking to a white sheet of paper with a little bit of vanilla ice cream on it that doesn't say anything.": "Kurt",
  "It's not that I find it hard to meet girls - they do come up and chat me up from time to time. Sometimes I'm interested, I tend not to go for the prettier ones. I prefer the quirkier types.": "Rupert",
  "I'm not interested in serial dating I'd honestly rather be single. ": "Tamsin",
  "Oh, yeah, I did the online dating thing. I did Nerve, I did Match. On Nerve there was this one guy who, when I asked him what he did for a living, said he 'used to be in a band.' I was like, 'That is not an occupation.'": "Julie",
  "I didn't write my book, 'I Don't Care About Your Band,' in order to give women a brand-new set of dating rules they need to feel terrible about not abiding. I wrote my book to make the women who read it feel good about themselves, and a little more entitled to be treated well by the guys they go out with.": "Julie",
  "I'm not traditional at all. It's not that I'm against marriage; it just never mattered that much to me. If I was dating someone who getting married was very important to them, then absolutely. I'd have no problem. I love the idea of finding someone to be a great father figure to Jasper and to share my life with.": "Georgina",
  "People could rationally decide that prolonged relationships take up too much time and effort and that they'd much rather do other kinds of things. But most people are afraid of rejection.": "Albert",
  "I also like men who like dogs. I couldn't date a man who doesn't like my dog.": "Kristin",
  "Like many of you, I've always been slightly obsessed with vampires, dating back to the prime-time series 'Dark Shadows,' which I followed avidly as a kid.": "Bill",
  "I don't want to be the person who has the gigantic headlines: 'Look Who So-and-So Is Dating Now.' That, to me, isn't really who I am.": "Chris",
  "I've got mates who have got married through meeting on Internet dating sites, so it really can work out - even if sometimes it does go disastrously wrong.": "Sheridan",
  "I've dated men my age, younger than me and older. The only difference is the young ones are quicker at taking out the garbage.": "Lara",
  "I have experienced bad dating and ineptitude with women all across the globe, from Vietnam to Paris. When I was 21, women were an enigma; they were this code that had to be cracked. They were 'The Other.' I have often thought writing this stuff into stand-up and shows would be an exorcism, but it hasn't been; it makes no difference.": "Stephen",
  "Honestly, I think dating is hard. Period.": "Sevyn",
  "It's the fashion, I tell you: big, tall women going out with tiny, tiny men.": "Nicholas",
  "My girlfriend bought me a down jacket, she said it fit my personality.": "Jay",
  "Dating is for tools.": "Neil",
  "So I go to my first book signing, and these two girls came up and gave me a piece of paper: '10 reasons you should date our dad. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro. He's a lawyer.' He didn't know what was going on. He didn't even know me. They called him, and he came down and asked me out that day. Now I'm dating their dad!": "Hoda",
  "My grandmother always used to wear this English perfume called Tuberose and then she died and then I dated this girl who wore the same thing. Every time I hung out with her, I could only think of my recently deceased grandmother. So sometimes a signature scent can be good and sometimes it can be bad.": "Mark",
  "So if I was dating somebody now and the relationship didn't work out, I'd take that as failing.": "Gavin",
  "When I don't have a girlfriend, who I am answerable to, I can go out and hang with people. But whether you go for a movie with someone or a meal or a drive, it is assumed that you are dating that person.": "Shahid",
  "Someone who'll bring some normalcy into my life and help me stay in touch with reality. That is something I'm curious about. There are so many actors who are married to people from non-film backgrounds, and their marriages are successful. I'm tired of dating actresses.": "Shahid",
  "I have no wisdom to share on dating.": "Rachel",
  "Are you kidding? I'm a terrible cook, but John is a really great one. Literally, I never cook. The whole time we were dating, I prepared two officially romantic meals. Both of them were such disasters that he begs me never to go into the kitchen again.": "Rebecca",
  "Here's the funny thing about the response I've been aware of to my dating famous people: It's been very negative. I'm either not good-looking enough, not a good enough actor or not successful enough for these people.": "Dax",
  "I always wanted so much glamour in my life, so I have always been obsessed with class, and from dating a few people who were from old money and a few from new money in my 20s, I just sort of became obsessed with this idea of clueless rich people.": "Natasha",
  "I was dating this guy and we would spend all day text messaging each other. And he thought that he could tell that he liked me more because he actually spelt the word 'YOU' and I just put the letter 'U'.": "Kelly",
  "I have a lot of boyfriends, I want you to write that. Every country I visit, I have a different boyfriend. And I kiss them all.": "Anna",
  "I'm not interested in dating. I like being with my own best friend, me. Certain women, particularly older women, cannot believe I like going to a social event by myself. But I do.": "Gloria",
  "I still have a crush on Johnny Depp, and I literally only started dating my husband because he looked like Johnny Depp - and he knows that. We've been together for twelve years, and he still looks like Johnny Depp.": "Eliza",
  "I'm single, and I hate dating.": "Keshia",
  "After a number of years dating, we decided we were good partners.": "Melinda",
  "I'm finally dating. It's fun.": "Kristin",
  "No one knew me until I met my wife Lulu. Lulu's mother used to ask, Which one is Maurice? For six months she thought Lulu was dating Barry.": "Maurice",
  "I can't imagine dating someone famous. I try to stay away from that as much as I can.": "Dylan",
  "People tend to look at dating sort of like a safari - like they're trying to land the trophy.": "Henry",
  "I didn't have a financial need, and I wasn't very gifted at relationships. I probably was more like what we think of boys as being: hard to pin down and wary of commitment.": "Candice",
  "I was bullied. I was a bit of a geek. Good-looking guys were off-limits. I didn't start dating until I was 18.": "Michelle",
  "I love sushi. Once on Valentine's Day, someone I was dating rocked up at the airport to pick me up with a bag of salmon because I love it so much.": "Ella",
  "While I am aware of no counsel on whether kissing should be reserved only for post-mission dating or courtship, I am aware of plenty of counsel concerning honesty in our actions and treating others with respect and kindness. Casual attitudes about expressions of affection such as kissing can cause much grief and heartache.": "John",
  "I feel like there is always a rumor that I'm dating someone that I never met before. People have their judgments and ideas of who I am, and they know nothing.": "Lauren",
  "I don't know the first real thing about the dating game. I don't know how to talk to a specific person and connect. I just think you have to go to person by person and do the best you can with people in general.": "Jason",
  "Women always try to see the one good part of The Weird Guy because the dating landscape is so bleak. Women will say, 'He's very odd, but he likes to cook. He's creepy, but he makes good pancakes!'": "Zoe",
  "Mum left school at 15, and after a few years of modelling and dating jazz musicians, was married by 21 to my father, Mike Taylor, a journalist on the 'Daily Mirror.' They had my brother and me pretty quickly and had split up by the time I was two. I don't really have any memories of them as a couple.": "Natascha",
  "Dating is just awkward moments and one person wants more than the other. It's just that constant strangeness. I think it's a very real thing.": "Jason",
  "It's difficult dating as an actor because your free time is precious. The guy I end up with someday is going to have to love traveling.": "Serinda",
  "I'm Canadian. The only difference between dating American and Canadian guys is whether you'll be watching football or hockey. I have no preference.": "Serinda",
  "I also find it interesting that a lot of people in their 30s are not married and don't have kids. There are a lot of people in this age bracket that are out there dating and trying to find love. And I never thought that at my age I would be.": "John",
  "If you're dating the quarterback and then you go out with the hockey player, you just go to the hockey games. I don't think I'll still go to the football games.": "Nicolle",
  "I've given up looking for a boyfriend. That's not to say I won't be interested if the right guy comes along. But I'm not in a hurry.": "Emily",
  "It's always been my personal feeling that unless you are married, there is something that is not very dignified about talking about who you are dating.": "Luke",
  "Back in high school, I went on dates, but I was too focused on my career. My parents were like, 'It's nice to have a boyfriend, but it's even nicer to own your house when you're 21.'": "Amber",
  "I've always gone out with much younger guys. But I rushed into relationships before really getting to know the person. What would come up as a warning sign within the first two weeks of dating would usually be the exact reason the relationship would end!": "Carrie",
  "If I talk to a woman for more than five minutes I can tell you exactly whether she's an Aidan girl or a Mr. Big girl. Aidan girls are more interested in nurturing relationships and building a nest while Mr. Big girls are more about show and having fun.": "Michael",
  "We had two rules growing up in my house: If you're going to take a shower, do it with whomever you're dating so you don't waste water; and if you buy one for yourself, buy six, because everybody's going to want one.": "Moon",
  "If you look at Gothic detailing right down to the bottom of a column or the capital of a column, it's a small version of the whole building; that's why, like dating the backbones of a dinosaur, a good historian can look at a detail of a Gothic building and tell you exactly what the rest of the building was, and infer the whole from the parts.": "Charles",
  "I knew a ton of actors and was friends with them, but I never dated actresses. I tried to date 'normal' people because the Hollywood dating rule is 'one star per couple' because it's quite a challenge to match the egos of two actors.": "Zach",
  "Everything I buy is vintage and smells funny. Maybe that's why I don't have a boyfriend.": "Lucy",
  "I had to deal with being somewhat of an outcast because it's not socially acceptable to be a struggling musician. There have been times where I've felt sorry for the person I was dating. I felt she deserved better.": "Taylor",
  "I think feminism's a bit misinterpreted. It was about casting off all gender roles. There's nothing wrong with a man holding a door open for a girl. But we sort of threw away all the rules, so everybody's confused. And dating becomes a sloppy, uncomfortable, unpleasant thing.": "Zosia",
  "I've surfed the Web and the whole dating connection. I find that pretty fascinating, but no real leads.": "Taylor",
  "I don't mind dating younger men now.": "Jackee",
  "I'd got to that age when I was out on a date with a guy and I would be thinking: Don't mention your age, don't mention that you want a child - because they would just run out the door.": "Denise",
  "At the time that I knew them, they were not living together. They began dating again after their divorce, so I didn't really see fighting.": "Kato",
  "I don't want to be one of those 40-something guys in L.A. still dating, still going out to clubs and chasing 21-year-olds. It's not a good look.": "Jesse",
  "I started dating older men, and I would fall in love with them. I thought they could teach me about life.": "Daphne",
  "What I remember most about junior homecoming was my date getting sick afterwards. That kinda sucked. Then, senior year, someone got gum in her hair when we were dancing. She had to get one of the chaperones to take her to the office and cut up her hair. I felt really bad for her, but it worked out fine.": "James",
  "I stopped dating for six months a year ago. Dating requires a lot of energy and focus.": "Daphne",
  "I want to start dating the man that I'm gonna marry. I want to start having some fun with someone that I know I'm gonna be with. I don't play any games. I'm too old for that. I've been there I've been around the block. ": "LisaRaye",
  "I think probably - I think, you know, when you're first dating somebody, if they're just not that physical with you, if they don't want to make concrete plans with you, you know, if they're sort of ambiguous about where everything is going, I think that's a pretty good sign that they're not into you.": "Greg",
  "It was funny actually because that was still during the time we were dating. He would get all these calls because supposedly before we broke up, we had already broken up in the trades, in the rags or whatever.": "Rosario",
  "I fantasize about going back to high school with the knowledge I have now. I would shine. I would have a good time, I would have a girlfriend. I think that's where a lot of my pain comes from. I think I never had any teenage years to go back to.": "Spalding",
  "I want a guy I can go hiking with, who wants to do outdoorsy stuff. It's so much fun to be out in nature and who better to do that with than the person you're dating?": "Adrianne",
  "Yeah, I think everybody has the crises of questioning themselves at some point or other in their lives. Is this where I should live? The job I should have? The girl I should be dating? Is this the friend I should have?": "Chris",
  "I wish I was dating one of the ladies in 'Bollywood Hero.' They're gorgeous. Any of them.": "Chris",
  "Years later I would hear my father say the divorce had left him dating his children. That still meant picking us up every Sunday for a matinee and, if he had the money, an early dinner somewhere.": "Andre",
  "That's the dating world. You just keep losing. Everyone does.": "Riki",
  "My mum wants me to get married - and have children, of course. She's met Gaga; we've been dating a while. We're in a committed relationship, and I'm really happy in my relationship. I'm a very lucky guy. As far as having more of a domestic life and settling down into my relationship, we have to see what happens.": "Taylor",
  "I am dating, but it is hard to find someone quick enough and funny enough. I am quite demanding.": "Anne",
  "Dating and getting attention from boys was something that came later to me.": "Rachelle",
  "I've been in plenty of situations where someone I'm dating had more time for a console than me.": "Josie",
  "I'm currently single, so I want to have fun! As for what guys need to do to date out of their league, it's all about the swagger. If you have confidence, you can get pretty much any girl.": "Krysten",
  "I highly suggest marriage to all my friends who are dating.": "Jerry",
  "The learned are not agreed as to the time when the Gospel of John was written; some dating it as early as the year 68, others as late as the year 98; but it is generally conceded to have been written after all the others.": "Simon",
  "You're talking to someone who has been married to various people for the last 40 years of her life. Dating is not really something familiar. I've never really been a dater.": "Stockard",
  "My wife and I have been together since 1986. I graduated in '86 and she graduated in '88. We began dating when she was 17. Actually she turned 18 when we started kissing and stuff.": "Cuba",
  "Were I to put myself on... one of those online dating things, I would not include in my profile that I'm regularly hospitalized for psychosis. But I do know that when I get really bad, there is a place for me to go where I will feel better.": "Marya",
  "I'm not very good at dating. I'm very decisive. If I like someone, then they're my boyfriend. It's pretty straightforward.": "Vinessa",
  "The trail of dating sites relying heavily on Facebook is littered with failures.": "Sunil",
  "I wouldn't mind telling my five good friends that I'm dating, but I don't want my loose connections to know.": "Sunil",
  "I think if I could have a boyfriend like my brothers I'd be really happy. But without the brother thing.": "Patricia",
  "Oh, my dating skills are the worst. No, I pick the wrong men; it's amazing. I am awful, the worst dater.": "Paget",
  "When I started 'DailyGrace,' I was dating a 26-year-old guy I thought was the funniest person in the world. My creation process every day was imagining him watching my videos and wondering, 'Will he laugh at this?' But somehow that's turned into an audience that's mostly 15-year-old girls.": "Grace",
  "It's tough to be 68 and dating. I've given it up now.": "Ian",
  "People usually spend the first two months playing themselves up, not really being themselves. You waste those two months - and then they tell you, 'You're not who I was dating the first month!'": "Manny",
  "Just ask for what you want. I requested a six-month break from Facebook to visit my parents I asked to switch projects. I told my husband it was time to get married after six years of dating! ": "Ruchi",
  "It's weird to have people so interested in your personal life. It's a part of the business that grosses me out. I'm always bummed out for people who just happen to be dating a celebrity, and they're also famous, and they can't live their life.": "Andy",
  "I feel like I am a real artist and I want to be able to feel what I am singing about. So when I sing, 'Leave (Get Out),' I have been through that. I think it is just a new generation, whether people are ready for it or not. Teenagers are dating.": "JoJo",
  "The difference between being a part-time writer and a full-time writer is like the difference between dating someone and living with them. Some of the romance is gone, but you learn things you'd never know just by dating.": "Scott",
  "My daughter's mother and I are no longer dating, and the people I'm most likely to date are those around me, who are athletes.": "Tyson",
  "I haven't been brought down because people are focused on who I'm dating, what I'm eating, or what handbag is the best handbag - that's so cheap to me. But if others want to open up about their personal lives, that is their choice. It's not for me to judge.": "Garrett",
  "Frankly, the reason I joined MENSA is because I was dating a guy at the time who spoke five languages and could solve a Rubik's Cube literally with his eyes closed because it's just an algorithm.": "Ashley",
  "Everybody knows now that Marie Lightfoot, the true crime writer, is dating Franklin DeWeese, the state attorney of Howard County, Florida. They know I'm a white woman; they know he's a black man. That's not news anymore.": "Nancy",
  "I'm the one who's dating the craft-service guy instead of the producer. Plus, if a producer is going to date a hot young thing, I'm probably not the first person on their list - the weird, quirky, funny girl.": "Whitney",
  "I can't wait for my little sisters to start dating, because it will really be fun to pick on their boyfriends.": "David",
  "I really like dating stories, like in Betty and Veronica comics; I like David Lynch and H.P. Lovecraft for the dark gut-wrenching stuff, and I'm inspired by Miyazaki's films for the subtle heart-warming moments, as well as the moments that blew up my imagination.": "Fred",
  "I try not to read the stuff online because it's so hurtful and stuff. There was somebody that said I was messing up my genetics by dating my boyfriend because he's not black. It was an interesting thing to read.": "Taylour",
  "I've been dating younger men since my 20s, When I was 29, I dated someone 21... younger men are just more fun. I like their energy. I've always been kind of young for my age.": "Dana",
  "I don't do a lot of dating. I guess it's kind of like everyone is always trying to set me up with somebody, so we go out and hang out at a club or somewhere. I think dates are weird.": "Matt",
  "I'm enjoying dating. I'm single, though, I'm not in a relationship.": "Matt",
  "We don't do 'dating' in Sweden.": "Caroline",
  "I'm dating a very high-maintenance career.": "Aimee",
  "Is Amazon truly the best online buying experience? Absolutely not. Is eBay the best platform for auction? Probably not. Are dating sites like match.com really a reflection of the way people date? Probably not.": "Danny",
  "I have very little experience with dating websites. My feeling toward dating websites is what most people's is: If it works, great. If you're serious and legitimate about it and know what you're looking for, then from what I hear, it's definitely effective.": "Nev",
  "Is there a doctor in the house? My parents want me to marry you.": "Wendy",
  "I've been on so many blind dates, I should get a free dog.": "Wendy",
  "I think a nice romantic dinner should be saved for when you and the girl you're dating or seeing have something special and it's a more special occasion.": "Ben",
  "I got that experience through dating dozens of men for six years after college, getting an entry level magazine job at 21, working in the fiction department at Good Housekeeping and then working as a fashion editor there as well as writing many articles for the magazine.": "Judith",
  "I grew up between the two world wars and received a rather solid general education, the kind middle class children enjoyed in a country whose educational system had its roots dating back to the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.": "George",
  "Dating now is a lot like going shopping when you don't have any money. Even if you find the right thing, you can't do anything about it.": "Joshua",
  "I'm not saying dating is sinful, and I'm not saying a guy and a girl should never spend time alone together. I'm saying let's wait until we can be purposeful, so there's a reason behind our relationship, and we're not just stirring up passion for the sake of a good time.": "Joshua",
  "My husband's a little younger than me. When I first started dating him, I just fell mad for him. I made a deal with myself: I was like, 'I'm not gonna get weird about what the future might be. I'm just going to be in every moment I can and enjoy us to the fullest.' I told him that, too.": "Joelle",
  "If you're a good Amish girl, you're courting, you have three or four different beaus, and you go out and stay out all night. That's just their tradition. They date under the covering of night. No one knows who they're dating or seeing until two weeks before they're going to be married. It's how they've done it for 300 years.": "Beverly",
  "I date older men, and I date younger men. I have no rules about that.": "Mary",
  "I'm a bad dater - I'm just not good at it. It's so weird dating in this town. It's like high school. I get a lot of people who have their publicist call my agent to ask, 'Is she dating anyone?'": "Jules",
  "Love was not in it for me at first. I dated guys because of the way they looked. And then I began to learn that it's what's inside that counts. Love to me now is understanding. It's giving.": "Crystal",
  "I hated the idea of a high school sweetheart. Growing up, oh my God, it just made me sick. I wanted to have a range of cool boyfriends. I wanted to travel around and date these interesting men. Then it just happened. You fall in love.": "Charlotte",
  "People with film careers get a whole onslaught of people they spend 12 hours a day with every three months. It's like speed dating. You've got a fast-track to social intimacy with a whole bunch of people.": "Christine",
  "What online dating did was offer me the opportunity to go out with a bunch of different people from different industries I really didn't want to limit myself with people who are in the entertainment industry. ": "Essence",
  "Facebook and pictures on the Internet have created such a different way of dating. It's not necessarily good because an obsessive quality can develop in people.": "Alexander",
  "I'm a bit of a romantic, to a fault. It's led me to some great things and also some sad things. It's made me a better person, to keep a good spirit about dating.": "Alexander",
  "When I was five years old, I told my parents that I wanted to take ballet. So, ballet was the focus of my life... until puberty. Then I discovered boys and started dating a guy with a mohawk who'd come to my ballet class and freak everybody out. Shortly after that is when I quit.": "Chandra",
  "When you're young and dating someone, just play it safe and don't try so hard.": "Matt",
  "The most beautiful things are not associated with money; they are memories and moments. If you don't celebrate those, they can pass you by.": "Alek",

  "Never spend your money before you have earned it.": "Thomas",
  "Money and success don't change people they merely amplify what is already there. ": "Will",
  "There are three faithful friends - an old wife, an old dog, and ready money.": "Benjamin",
  "Obesity in children is growing out of control. A big part of this is economic. Fake foods are more affordable. It's enticing people to eat more because they think they're saving money when they're really just buying heart disease.": "Jillian",
  "Greed is not a financial issue. It's a heart issue.": "Andy",
  "In this financial year we will be spending at least $1.5 billion on foreign aid and we cannot be sure that this money will be properly spent, as corruption and mismanagement in many of the recipient countries are legend.": "Pauline",
  "Life started getting good when I started making money.": "Balthazar",
  "Encouragement to others is something everyone can give. Somebody needs what you have to give. It may not be your money it may be your time. It may be your listening ear. It may be your arms to encourage. It may be your smile to uplift. Who knows? ": "Joel",
  "A good reputation is more valuable than money.": "Publilius",
  "If you stop at general math, you're only going to make general math money.": "Snoop",
  "Private jets cost a lot of money.": "Donald",
  "It is not the style of clothes one wears, neither the kind of automobile one drives, nor the amount of money one has in the bank, that counts. These mean nothing. It is simply service that measures success.": "George",
  "I've been living the American Dream for over 25 years - just being able to do what I do, be creative, and make money out of it. It's incredible.": "Dr.",
  "One day I said to my dad, 'Are you disappointed that I'm working a minimum-wage job and I didn't go to college?' I'll never forget his response. He said, 'It's not about how much money you make or what your job is, but it's more about your character. For that, I'm proud of you.'": "Josh",
  "There's something about a holiday that isn't all about how much money you spend.": "Hilarie",
  "To make an embarrassing admission, I like video games. That's what got me into software engineering when I was a kid. I wanted to make money so I could buy a better computer to play better video games - nothing like saving the world.": "Elon",
  "Every day we are paying more for energy than we should due to poor insulation, inefficient lights, appliances, and heating and cooling equipment - money we could save by investing in energy efficiency.": "Bernie",
  "There is no monopoly on becoming a millionaire. If you're jealous of those with more money, don't just sit there and complain - do something to make more money yourself.": "Gina",
  "I never attempt to make money on the stock market. I buy on the assumption that they could close the market the next day and not reopen it for five years.": "Warren",
  "I think the American Dream used to be achieving one's goals in your field of choice - and from that, all other things would follow. Now, I think the dream has morphed into the pursuit of money: Accumulate enough of it, and the rest will follow.": "Buzz",

  "Making money is a hobby that will complement any other hobbies you have, beautifully.": "Scott",

  "Just take yourself back to September 2001. As that month went on, and as that autumn unrolled, everybody wanted to do something. How can I help? Do you want my blood? Do you want money for the victims? I was a captain in the Marine Corps. I knew what I could do. I was right there. I was ready. I saw it. I moved the rubble with my own hands.": "Rob",

  "Want of money and the distress of a thief can never be alleged as the cause of his thieving, for many honest people endure greater hardships with fortitude. We must therefore seek the cause elsewhere than in want of money, for that is the miser's passion, not the thief s.": "William",

  "I've been looking around, and I noticed something: how much you really need to be loved. Ambition isn't just a desperate quest for positions or money. It's just love - lots of love.": "Janis",
  "When I was young I thought that money was the most important thing in life now that I am old I know that it is. ": "Oscar",
  "Athletes and musicians make astronomical amounts of money. People get paid $100 million to throw a baseball! Shouldn't we all take less and pass some of that money onto others?

  "Innovation has nothing to do with how many R & D dollars you have. When Apple came up with the Mac, IBM was spending at least 100 times more on R & D. It's not about money. It's about the people you have, how you're led, and how much you get it.": "Steve",

  "It's hard to tell with these Internet startups if they're really interested in building companies or if they're just interested in the money.

  "You aren't wealthy until you have something money can't buy.": "Garth",
  "International affairs is very much run like the mafia. The godfather does not accept disobedience, even from a small storekeeper who doesn't pay his protection money.

  "I want to go to - what's that hot country with a lot of money? - Dubai.": "Grandmaster",
  "You gotta remember: we're musicians... we're just crazy people who can't get along sometimes. I've definitely come to the table with my knife in my pocket a couple of times you know how it is.

  "When we talk about the kind of folks whose lives will be made better by raising the minimum wage, we're not talking about a couple teenagers earning extra spending money to supplement their allowance.

  "People who get trapped in the tunnel vision of making money think that is all there is to life.": "Felix",
  "Young children need to develop good habits that will be useful to them the rest of their lives. It is important to keep the lessons age-appropriate.

  "Indians mock their corrupt politicians relentlessly, but they regard their honest politicians with silent suspicion.

  "Don't build a glass house if you're worried about saving money on heating.": "Philip",
  "You want to buy cars and houses and castles, all of that's on you and how America has systematized your mind to be into materialism. Hip-hop ain't got nothing to do with that.

  "I spend my money on holidays and eating out, and it allows me to be generous.": "James",
  "I believe God wants you to have money to pay your bills, send your kids to college and do charity work and build orphanages. There's the teaching that we're supposed to be poor to show that we're humble. I don't buy that. I think we're supposed to be leaders. We're supposed to excel.": "Joel",
  "My parents survived the Great Depression and brought me up to live within my means, save some for tomorrow, share and don't be greedy, work hard for the necessities in life knowing that money does not make you better or more important than anyone else. So, extravagance has been bred out of my DNA.": "David",

  "Back in the 1970s, Kodak tried to give $25m to a black civil rights organisation in Rochester, New York. The company's shareholders rose up in arms: making this politically charged offering wasn't the reason they had entrusted Kodak with their money. The donation was withdrawn.": "Noreena",

  "We live in a digital world where all is available at the touch of a screen. Money has been simplified, changed subtly over time from tangible bills to numbers in cyberspace. Cash is no longer in a cloth bag; it's numbers on a screen. Numbers that can be manipulated and modified. If you run out of numbers, you can just buy some more, right?": "Rhys",
  "There's a time in everyone's career where you go, 'Ah, this is hard - how long am I going to have to do this?' But the rewards are so great. Who gets to go on the podium and hear the national anthem? The whole nation singing! Money can't buy you that.": "Mo",
  "One of the big myths about philanthropy is that it's all about donating funds for a cause. I like to look at it quite differently. Philanthropy is about 'giving' - not just in monetary terms but also in non-monetary aspects, like time, ideas, or being a volunteer. Donating money is just a small part of philanthropy.": "Pankaj",

  "Ridiculous yachts and private planes and big limousines won't make people enjoy life more, and it sends out terrible messages to the people who work for them. It would be so much better if that money was spent in Africa - and it's about getting a balance.": "Richard",
  "I never lost money by turning a profit.": "Bernard",
  "I try to do the right thing with money. Save a dollar here and there, clip some coupons. Buy ten gold chains instead of 20. Four summer homes instead of eight.": "LL",
  "I actually thought that it would be a little confusing during the same period of your life to be in one meeting when you're trying to make money, and then go to another meeting where you're giving it away.

  "Money coming in says I've made the right marketing decisions.": "Adam",

  "I spent three days a week for 10 years educating myself in the public library, and it's better than college. People should educate themselves - you can get a complete education for no money. At the end of 10 years, I had read every book in the library and I'd written a thousand stories.": "Ray",
  "The system that enables the most people to earn the most success is free enterprise, by matching up people's skills, interests, and abilities.

  "Money is speech. It's incongruous to say a multimillionaire can spend as much on his own campaign as he wants, but you can only give $2,300. His free speech rights are different from yours, thus violating the Equal Protection Clause of the Constitution. It's absurd.": "Roger",
  "Too many people measure how successful they are by how much money they make or the people that they associate with. In my opinion, true success should be measured by how happy you are.": "Richard",
  "The new American dream is one of responsibility. What is the bottom-line number that you're going to be able to pay back toward a student loan responsibly if you're doing it yourself after you have a job?

  "I probably wouldn't be a songwriter if I didn't grow up the way I did. It was difficult and it was at times very scary to grow up in a household so unsettled and at times very violent. But, it also, I guess it earned me a sort of wisdom at a young age that's served me well.": "Ray",

  "He who devotes sixteen hours a day to hard study may become at sixty as wise as he thought himself at twenty.": "Mary",
  "Wisdom prepares for the worst, but folly leaves the worst for the day when it comes.": "Richard",
  "Nobility of spirit has more to do with simplicity than ostentation, wisdom rather than wealth, commitment rather than ambition.": "Riccardo",
  "We don't pray for the land. We pray for the humans, all humans... starting with the president, Mohammed Morsi, and all officials, and for God to give everyone wisdom and responsibility to manage the affairs of this country and its people in true Egyptian spirit.": "Pope",
  "I always prayed that God would give me the wisdom and the vision to do the things on this earth that I was supposed to do to express His life and love and His will.": "Billy",
  "Virtues are acquired through endeavor, which rests wholly upon yourself.": "Sidney",
  "If the highest things are unknowable, then the highest capacity or virtue of man cannot be theoretical wisdom.": "Leo",
  "Public opinion is no more than this: what people think that other people think.": "Alfred",
  "Wisdom is knowing what to do next virtue is doing it. ": "David",
  "And it is no less true, that personal security and private property rest entirely upon the wisdom, the stability, and the integrity of the courts of justice.": "Joseph",
  "He dares to be a fool, and that is the first step in the direction of wisdom.": "James",
  "The most excellent and divine counsel, the best and most profitable advertisement of all others, but the least practiced, is to study and learn how to know ourselves. This is the foundation of wisdom and the highway to whatever is good.": "Pierre",
  "Instead of looking at life as a narrowing funnel, we can see it ever widening to choose the things we want to do, to take the wisdom we've learned and create something.": "Liz",
  "If you believe the doctors, nothing is wholesome; if you believe the theologians, nothing is innocent; if you believe the military, nothing is safe.": "Lord",
  "A judge's role is to ensure that the legislature remains within the limits of its assigned authority under the Constitution. Judges have no authority to second-guess the wisdom of the value judgments and policy choices the legislature has made.": "Paul",
  "The result showed the wisdom of your orders.": "John",
  "Lord, bless me with the ability to achieve all that I can, and the wisdom to realize it doesn't all have to be by tomorrow!": "William",
  "The cars we drive say a lot about us.": "Alexandra",
  "See, when you drive home today, you've got a big windshield on the front of your car. And you've got a little bitty rearview mirror. And the reason the windshield is so large and the rearview mirror is so small is because what's happened in your past is not near as important as what's in your future.": "Joel",
  "It's a never ending battle of making your cars better and also trying to be better yourself.": "Dale",
  "The fact is I don't drive just to get from A to B. I enjoy feeling the car's reactions, becoming part of it.": "Enzo",
  "Maybe the bike is more dangerous, but the passion for the car for me is second to the bike.": "Valentino",
  "Cars are the sculptures of our everyday lives.": "Chris",
  "I've always been asked, 'What is my favorite car?' and I've always said 'The next one.'": "Carroll",
  "It's like driving a car at night. You never see further than your headlights, but you can make the whole trip that way.": "E.",
  "Everything in life is somewhere else, and you get there in a car.": "E.",
  "I race to win. If I am on the bike or in a car it will always be the same.": "Valentino",
  "Shoes make an outfit they're like rims for a car. ": "Omari",
  "Television, radio, social media. The 24/7 news cycle plows forward mercilessly on our desks, in our cars and in our pockets. Thousands and thousands of messages and voices bombard us from the moment we wake, fighting for our attention. All we see and hear, all day long, is news. And most of it is bad.": "Joseph",
  "A racing car is an animal with a thousand adjustments.": "Mario",
  "My wife wants sex in the back of the car and she wants me to drive.": "Rodney",
  "Once you become successful, people know where you live, the type of house you live in, the kind of car you drive, the clothes you wear, and so it would be patronising to go and talk like a welder. Welding's a mystery to me now. You can't go back, your life changes every day.": "Billy",
  "A new car is not going to change your life.": "Monica",
  "Whether you live in a city or a small town, and whether you drive a car, take the bus or ride a train, at some point in the day, everyone is a pedestrian.": "Anthony",
  "People think getting a new partner is like getting a new car.": "Orlando",
  "We at BMW do not build cars as consumer objects, just to drive from A to B. We build mobile works of art.": "Chris",
  "Now, personally, I like a car with some sort of character.": "Richard",
  "I will never shave off my beard and moustache. I did once, for charity, but my wife said, 'Good grief, how awful, you look like an American car with all the chrome removed.'": "Rolf",
  "The year most of my high school friends and I got our driver's permits, the coolest thing one could do was stand outside after school and twirl one's car keys like a lifeguard whistle. That jingling sound meant freedom and power.": "Sloane",
  "I hate the hand that comes out of a car and just drops litter in the street. I hate that! For some reason, it just fills me with fury! It's just utter laziness, lack of interest in other people, lack of interest in the planet, in the hedgehog who might eat the plastic bag, it's a lack of concern.": "Joanna",
  "Life is a gamble. You can get hurt, but people die in plane crashes, lose their arms and legs in car accidents; people die every day. Same with fighters: some die, some get hurt, some go on. You just don't let yourself believe it will happen to you.": "Muhammad",
  "Yeah, it's risky, but no more risky than driving a car.": "Cory",
  "If you saw a dog going to be crushed under a car, wouldn't you help him?": "Oskar",
  "A doctor is not a mechanic. A car doesn't react with a mechanic, but a human being does.": "Randa",
  "I take cabs if I need to get somewhere or I take car service. I don't drive, I wouldn't mind riding a bike... People think that because you become an entertainer you gotta have this rock star thug image. I'm an artist, man. I'm going to live like an artist.": "ASAP",
  "Museums are like the quiet car of the world. It's a place you can come to escape, where there's authenticity, there's uniqueness, there's calm, there's physicality.": "Thomas",
  "We have lost our vision for the future. Before, we say, 'Nothing will be the same. Cars will fly, and we go to the end of the universe.' We have this kind of naive but exciting idea of the future. Now, the vision has been reduced to ways to select our garbage and how to survive global warming.": "Jean-Michel",
  "The majority of my interactions with police were not good. There were a few good ones who were actually protecting the community. But then you have ones from the Valley. They never met me in their life, but since I'm a kid in basketball shorts and a white T-shirt, they wanna slam me on the hood of the car. Sixteen years old.": "Kendrick",
  "Engineers are behind the cars we drive, the pills we pop and the way we power our homes.": "James",
  "I know a lot about cars, man. I can look at any car's headlights and tell you exactly which way it's coming.": "Mitch",
  "Only a crazy person wouldn't fear approaching a car with tinted windows during a late-night car stop, or pounding up a flight of stairs to execute a search warrant, or fast-roping from a helicopter down into hostile fire. Real agents, like real people, feel that fear in the pit of their stomachs.": "James",
  "When a police officer tells you to stay in the car, you stay in the car.": "Reese",
  "I live a fairly simple life, and that didn't change much after I sold TechCrunch in 2010. I didn't buy a new house or even a new car. The one thing I did splurge on was a boat. Nothing too fancy or large.": "Michael",
  "I think there are more politicians in favor of electric cars than against. There are still some that are against, and I think the reasoning for that varies depending on the person, but in some cases, they just don't believe in climate change - they think oil will last forever.": "Elon",
  "I don't want to die in a car accident. When I die it'll be a glorious day. It'll probably be a waterfall.": "River",
  "I had to stop driving my car for a while... the tires got dizzy.": "Steven",
  "Normal is getting dressed in clothes that you buy for work, driving through traffic in a car that you are still paying for, in order to get to a job that you need so you can pay for the clothes, car and the house that you leave empty all day in order to afford to live in it.": "Ellen",
  "And suddenly I realised that I was no longer driving the car consciously. I was driving it by a kind of instinct, only I was in a different dimension.": "Ayrton",
  "Family and God - that is what's important. Money, cars, those are things that come and go.": "Fabrice",
  "The energy of the crowd is insane. Twenty thousand people. It's the biggest jolt of adrenaline. It's very hard to explain. You know the old story about the woman lifting the car off her kid? It's in that realm. You can actually hurt yourself and not know it.": "Tom",
  "Fast cars are my only vice.": "Michael",
  "Sense the blessings of the earth in the perfect arc of a ripe tangerine, the taste of warm, fresh bread, the circling flight of birds, the lavender color of the sky shining in a late afternoon rain puddle, the million times we pass other beings in our cars and shops and out among the trees without crashing, conflict, or harm.": "Jack",
  "It's that I don't like white paper backgrounds. A woman does not live in front of white paper. She lives on the street, in a motor car, in a hotel room.": "Helmut",
  "A lot of fun stuff happens when you go out on a bike compared to when you're in a car. You're more in the environment. It's enjoyable. Even when It's raining It's still fun.": "Stone",
  "Thinking of possibilities is like driving a car on a freeway. You have an open road that stretches endlessly before you where your thoughts are not shackled. But when we say 'impossible,' we have already reached a dead-end in our minds. So dwell on possibilities to open up your horizon.": "Pankaj",
  "In Brussels, you are able to have a lot of appointments in a day. In Paris, you can have one, two, maybe three, but you spend all your time on the road, in the car or in the suburbs. In Brussels, everything is easy. It's not a very big city, and the people are very quiet and warm.": "Eric-Emmanuel",
  "When you are fitted in a racing car and you race to win, second or third place is not enough.": "Ayrton",
  "A lot of the songs start with an image. I was sitting there playing the guitar and I pictured this old, dirty green car, with the window rolled down, in the hot, hot, hot Texas heat, and this beautiful woman I knew when I was a kid sitting behind the wheel, looking out at me.": "Edie",
  "I'm not trying to be new school and I'm not old school - I'm classic. There's a lot of new cars and there's a lot of old cars, but I'm just classic in doing what I do.": "LL",
  "I love fast cars... and to go too fast in them.": "Lara",
  "I'm a crazy car guy. I've got an airplane hangar full of cars.": "Paul",
  "I was hit by a car once on my bike, but I still rode home.": "Amy",
  "My first car was a motorcycle.": "Adam",
  "It's very hard for me to get a new car. It's really hard for me to get a new house. It's really hard for me to move on from the things that give me stability.": "Jodie",
  "Roads get wider and busier and less friendly to pedestrians. And all of the development based around cars, like big sprawling shopping malls. Everything seems to be designed for the benefit of the automobile and not the benefit of the human being.": "Bill",
  "I think cars encapsulate the history of innovation and style - it's the other side of the coin of the car being public enemy No.1.": "Norman",
  "Songs don't have to be about going out on Saturday night and having a good rink-up and driving home and crashing cars. A lot of what I've done is about alienation... about where you fit in society.": "David",
  "If I were to look in the United States or in Europe, in some of the garages, you would have a Bentley or two Bentleys or a high-end Mercedes, and you may find a Smart also in that same garage because that person thinks it's a fun extra car to have. He may have four cars but also have a Smart because he thinks it is cute.": "Ratan",
  "I enjoy racing historic motorcars from the '50s and '60s. The seed of my interest was planted when I was about 12 years old and took over my mother's Morris Minor. I drove it around my father's farm. But my favorite car is still a McLaren F1, which I have had for 10 years.": "Rowan",
  "It's annoying when someone's in front of you driving ten miles an hour, and you're like, 'Okay, today,' and someone else is on the side of you, so you can't pass them, and when you finally do pass them and they are texting, the laser cannons just come out and disintegrate that car.": "Glenn",
  "Flying a good airplane doesn't require near as much attention as a motor car.": "Charles",
  "Most people have no concept of how an automatic transmission works, yet they know how to drive a car. You don't have to study physics to understand the laws of motion to drive a car. You don't have to understand any of this stuff to use Macintosh.": "Steve",
  "My opinion is it's a bridge too far to go to fully autonomous cars.": "Elon",
  "Here is a new car, a new iPhone. We buy. We discard. We buy again. In recent years, we've been doing it faster.": "Arlie",
  "I want a car that will last 10 years or longer because I totally hate the process of researching, shopping for a new car, and then haggling for the price. I wish I could just snap my fingers and my car is there.": "Kiran",
  "Electric cars aren't pollution-free they have to get their energy from somewhere. ": "Alexandra",
  "Success is not two cars or a swimming pool. It's the approval of your peers.": "Peter",
  "The newly decorated theatres produced things like car parks and restaurants, so you could have a good night out, quite cheaply without all that bother of having to go somewhere else.": "Timothy",
  "To attract men, I wear a perfume called 'New Car Interior.'": "Rita",
  "I was quiet, a loner. I was one of those children where, if you put me in a room and gave me some crayons and a pencils, you wouldn't hear from me for nine straight hours. And I was always drawing racing cars and rockets and spaceships and planes, things that were very fast that would take me away.": "Gary",
  "I admit to wasting my life messing around with fast cars and motorcycles.": "Brock",
  "I'm starting to think about things that I want to do, things that are fun. One of them is driving a car like a Porsche. I've driven a lot of cars - sedans, trucks and big family vehicles all year long. But there's nothing like a four-wheel-drive Porsche.": "Kevin",
  "I've actually made a prediction that within 30 years a majority of new cars made in the United States will be electric. And I don't mean hybrid, I mean fully electric.": "Elon",
  "Every new car, you open the door, and you look at all those internal mellifluous swoopy bits, and they have no meaning.": "Jonathan",
  "I know people think we drive around in these nice cars and we do whatever we want and our parents will pay our credit cards, but that's not the case. Sure, my parents were generous; I got a nice car at 16, but at 18 I was cut off. I've worked really hard. I opened the store myself.": "Kim",
  "From solar to electric cars, from geothermal to reconfiguring the grid, the scale of investment needed in green technologies in order to meet whatever agreements on emissions reductions are finally agreed will be immense.": "Noreena",
  "I had a fairly enlightened dad, though if you looked at his resume, it might not seem that way. He was a chartered accountant for Price Waterhouse. He was strict, and we had a very ordered life. To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car.": "Hugh",
  "Onion rings in the car cushions do not improve with time.": "Erma",
  "There is a limit to the application of democratic methods. You can inquire of all the passengers as to what type of car they like to ride in, but it is impossible to question them as to whether to apply the brakes when the train is at full speed and accident threatens.": "Leon",
  "In Formula One, the car can make a difference in a way that a driver cannot. Whereas Michael Schumacher and Ayrton Senna spent their early seasons in second-rate machinery, Hamilton walked into the equal best car on the grid. His first season none the less has, by any standards, been extraordinary.": "Martin",
  "I'm a hard worker, and everything with me is, if I work hard, I should get paid for it. Everything with me, I try to symbolize something flashy like jewelry or a car. The rubbing hands is a symbol of hustling, so it goes back to the money.": "Birdman",
  "That's the first sign you know you're a Libertarian. You see the red light. You stop. You realize that there's not a car in sight. And you put your foot on the gas.": "Gary",
  "For me, not owning a car means I may spend a little extra time on public transportation, but I can use that time to read, catch up on work projects, and make the phone calls I couldn't get to earlier. Plus, I never waste time at the mechanics or gas station.": "Lynn",
  "In August of 2002, I survived a car accident. Although I can still see the van speeding toward us, I cannot bring to mind the crash itself - only its aftermath.": "Siri",
  "One person's car is another person's scenery.": "Jonathan",
  "We want to get to the point that using Uber is cheaper than owning a car.": "Travis",
  "The older Mercedes is absolutely beautiful. It's got that lovely purring feeling as the engine ticks over, which you just don't get in a modern car.": "Sarah",
  "At a European auto show, I had someone from a German car company come up to me and say the Karma should cost $125,000, not $87,900, but our development process lets us lower the costs. I guarantee it's profitable.": "Henrik",
  "When you get into a car, and there's trash, or it's dirty, or one of the hubcaps is off, you're like, 'Come on, dude.' Every woman likes the confidence and self-respect that says, 'I get oil changes. I look after my vehicle.' That's what I recommend: Act like you don't care, but take care of your body.": "T.",
  "I love vintage cars because you can do so much more to them.": "T-Pain",
  "I play the harmonica. The only way I can play is if I get my car going really fast, and stick it out the window.": "Steven",
  "The culture is going into a psychological depression. We are concerned about our place in the world, about being competitive: Will my children have as much as I have? Will I ever own my own home? How can I pay for a new car? Are immigrants taking away my white world?": "James",
  "I like to smile a lot before going in the car. I make jokes, even on the grid, and then I can still manage to focus when it counts.": "Romain",
  "I had a friend who was a clown. When he died, all his friends went to the funeral in one car.": "Steven",
  "We could definitely make a flying car - but that's not the hard part. The hard part is, how do you make a flying car that's super safe and quiet? Because if it's a howler, you're going to make people very unhappy.": "Elon",
  "We're in a giant car heading towards a brick wall and everyone's arguing over where they're going to sit.": "David",
  "We're going to test with the same car, but we have a new car ready.": "Larry",
  "My kids always perceived the bathroom as a place where you wait it out until all the groceries are unloaded from the car.": "Erma",
  "It's a massive motor in a tiny, lightweight car.": "Carroll",
  "Electric cars are coal-powered cars. Their carbon emissions can be worse than gasoline-powered cars.": "Vinod",
  "A car is like a mother-in-law - if you let it, it will rule your life.": "Jaime",
  "'Mosaic' is about what we see and what we don't see. I learned how people can develop other senses to compensate for a missing one when I was a child. My best friend, Carol, who is profoundly deaf, saved me from an approaching car that she 'heard' when I didn't.": "Gayle",
  "Parisians overwhelmingly buy small cars. And it's not because people are petite, but because fuel is drop-dead expensive. Gasoline costs more than twice as much in Paris as in New York.": "Serge",
  "I hooked up my accelerator pedal in my car to my brake lights. I hit the gas, people behind me stop, and I'm gone.": "Steven",
  "I replaced the headlights in my car with strobe lights, so it looks like I'm the only one moving.": "Steven",
  "In the last three years of racing I've met as many women fans as men fans, and in NASCAR it's the same thing. My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.": "Tim",
  "I would have probably stolen cars - it would have given me the same adrenaline rush as racing.": "Valentino",
  "I always do like seeing other people dance in their cars. It's one of the things that makes me happy.": "Ariel",
  "I only know it takes weeks to recover, as if one had been in a car accident.": "Patricia",
  "I dated a guy and he liked me but I didn't like him. I went through his wardrobe and cleaned out his house and got him to get a new car. He said to me, 'If I give you $10,000, will you find me my wife because I want someone like you?' And within a year, he got married. That was the first match that led to me leaving my corporate job.": "Patti",
  "Racism has been for everyone like a horrible, tragic car crash, and we've all been heavily sedated from it. If we don't come into consciousness of this tragedy, there's going to be a violent awakening we don't want. The question is, can we wake up?": "Anna",
  "Bad debt is debt that makes you poorer. I count the mortgage on my home as bad debt, because I'm the one paying on it. Other forms of bad debt are car payments, credit card balances, or other consumer loans.": "Robert",
  "The Rolls Royce was the real first car. It wasn't the first new car I got, but it was the first real car I bought that's like, 'Wow, I got this.'": "Meek",
  "I remember having my father stand over me when I had driven over my own foot; one leg was out of the car and one leg was in the car. He looked at me and told me that I was a drunk and that he was ashamed to call me his son. That night, I stopped drinking and I never drank again; I was twenty four.": "Randy",
  "If you think nobody cares if you're alive, try missing a couple of car payments.": "Earl",
  "In sport there is never any moment that is the same as the other. I have been in Formula One for 12 years, and out of that I had one year with the perfect car.": "Michael",
  "I'm not a bad driver. And I never will be because I took lessons when I was quite a boy. I never had to pass a test because there wasn't such a thing when I first started driving a motor car. So I didn't have to pass one.": "Richard",
  "As soon as I get my car I think I'll be going to the cinema more. Since I don't go very often, there are no films that are a must see at the moment. I usually wait till they come out on DVD.": "Tom",
  "The city needs a car like a fish needs a bicycle.": "Dean",
  "I know a man who doesn't pay to have his trash taken out. How does he get rid of his trash? He gift wraps it, and puts in into an unlocked car.": "Henny",
  "I've always had an affinity and a passion for cars and that whole car culture.": "Ludacris",
  "I've always wanted to race cars, ever since I was a young boy, as I think a lot of guys have.": "Paul",
  "I know I'm not supposed to like muscle cars, but I like muscle cars.": "Joe",
  "Detroit: Cars and rock 'n' roll. Not a bad combo.": "Kid",
  "You know what I really love? The CD players in a car. How when you put the CD right up by the slot, it actually takes it out of your hand, like it's hungry. It pulls it in, and you feel like it wants more silver discs.": "Tom",
  "A woman is gentle, soft, delicate, and a man's position is to protect her, help her up stairs, make sure she's in the car safely first. Take good care of your woman, and the sky's the limit!": "Taraji",
  "Driving will never be away from me - I can't just give it up. It's all I've ever done, and there's something about being in that car.": "Jimmie",
  "Short stories, for me, it's like you step inside this brand new car and you drive it and you drive it into a tree and you walk away from it.": "Kevin",
  "I am quite a relaxed person out of the car, but in the car I am aggressive, I never give up, I fight to the end and I try 100% all the time.": "Heikki",
  "Traffic in the streets of Bombay is chaotic at best. Riding a bicycle is a dangerous occupation. However, there are hundreds of them on the streets competing with the cars and buses and lorries because it is the poor man's mode of transport.": "Rohinton",
  "Why are video games so violent? The ones I've seen remind me of the 4th of July, with everything exploding, buildings, cars, airplanes, men and women. Kill, kill, and kill for sport and entertainment.": "Madeleine",
  "Rappers aren't the really rich ones. We all have nice houses with studios and cars, but you need a piece of someone's business to be super wealthy.": "Drake",
  "You can take lessons to become almost anything: flying lessons, piano lessons, skydiving lessons, acting lessons, race car driving lessons, singing lessons. But there's no class for comedy. You have to be born with it. God has to give you this gift.": "Steve",
  "My choices, including those related to the day-to-day aspects of life, like the use of a modest car, are related to a spiritual discernment that responds to a need that arises from looking at things, at people and from reading the signs of the times. Discernment in the Lord guides me in my way of governing.": "Pope",
  "People ask for this life, but they don't really understand what comes with it. People just see the outside and that looks good - big houses, cars, girls, but you never see how the person is feeling deep down inside. Me personally, being a man, I'm going to feel better displaying all of this and pouring my heart out on each record.": "Bow",
  "Justice is expensive in America. There are no Free Passes... You might want to remember this, the next time you get careless and blow off a few Parking Tickets. They will come back to haunt you the next time you see a Cop car in your rear-view mirror.": "Hunter",
  "In theory, cars are fairly simple. If they don't start, it's either the fuel system or the electrical system. Teach yourself about the path of each in your engine and tracing it is fairly straightforward. But at the beginning, mastering each new system seems like an unreachable shore. The car is effectively a black box.": "Adam",
  "I love to personalize things. I love to make things my own. I like to name everything - from cars to iPhones to the socks I just lost.": "Rachel",
  "My mother's sister was killed in a trolley car accident, so I was raised as one of eight with my sister and six male cousins.": "Alan",
  "The Internet has made some phenomenal breakthroughs that are still only poorly understood in terms of changing people's ideas of us and them. If mass media, social isolation in the suburbs, alienating workplaces and long car commutes create a bunker mentality, the Internet does the opposite.": "Alex",
  "You can't stop everything from happening. But we've gotten to a point where we're certainly trying. If a car doesn't have four hundred air bags in it, then it's no good.": "Clint",
  "If you think about computing, there isn't just one way to compute, just like there's not just one way to move around. You can have shoes, you can have a car, you can have a bicycle, submarine, rocket, plane, train, glider, whatever. Because you have one doesn't mean you get rid of another one... But PCs continue to be important.": "Michael",
  "I'm just disillusioned with the hip-hop sound right now. It's too materialistic. You know, I'm the kind of guy ... I can't do that. If you track my movement, you'll never see a picture of me with any girl that wasn't mine, or my own car. My jewelry, my clothes. What kind of gangsta rapper has a stylist? A stylist?!": "Ice",
  "When billionaire car dealers or manufacturers pay for ambassadorships, at least they pay with money earned by selling something of value.": "Elizabeth",
  "Have you read 'The Grapes of Wrath?' That was my family. My dad was a sharecropper in western Oklahoma. When the dust storms came and everything got wiped out, they came to California. The guys with the mattresses on the tops of their cars in the movie? That was the way it was.": "B.",
  "I noticed the people who drove the nicest cars were all in the garment business.": "Do",
  "I've always worked on my own home and different places that I've owned. I really enjoyed it. But I'm a mechanic, a motorcycle and car builder.": "Antonio",
  "I don't buy cars I can't drive.": "Wayne",
  "Most of us have to spend a lot of energy to learn how to drive a car. Then we have to spend the rest of our lives over-concentrating as we drive and text and eat a burrito and put on makeup. As a result, 30,000 people die every year in a car accident in the U.S.": "Astro",
  "When I turned 16, my dad made me sign a contract - he made us sign contracts for everything - that if I hit my car, I would be responsible for paying for it. I was in bumper-to-bumper traffic, and I tapped someone. It was so not a big deal, but I had to pay for it.": "Kim",
  "I have a nice car, a Mercedes. And then I have an old El Camino truck that I'm crazy about. I like to get in that truck and go up in the hills near where I live, in Vegas, and take my camera. That, to me, is Heaven, being out in nature, taking pictures of the wildlife.": "B.",
  "CGI has fully ruined car crashes. Because how can you be impressed with them now? When you watch them in the '70s, it was real cars, real metal, real blasts. They're really doing it and risking their lives. But I knew CGI was gonna start taking over.": "Quentin",
  "If you're one car accident away from poverty, you're on a high wire without a safety net. And that's a challenging proposition.": "Thomas",
  "Stationary storage will be as big as the car business long term. The growth rate will probably be several times what it is for the car business.": "Elon",
  "Latency is very important when you think about autonomous cars and things like that - 5G will really change the game, and I think will be another spike of growth in the wireless industry.": "Lowell",
  "I grew up on the back of a motorcycle - my dad didn't have a car until I was a teenager.": "Aisha",
  "Anyone who has ever been privileged to direct a film also knows that, although it can be like trying to write 'War and Peace' in a bumper car in an amusement park, when you finally get it right, there are not many joys in life that can equal the feeling.": "Stanley",
  "Why shouldn't a car key look like a car?": "Franz",
  "I've got a great team of engineers behind this race car. I've got a great bunch of mechanics that make it reliable. This car is developed to go out there and be better than the Reynard, and I feel that it is.": "Al",
  "Should we have background checks, waiting periods? To drive a car you have to pass a test that shows you know how to drive your car safely, you should have to do the same thing with guns.": "Michael",
  "I was a workaholic. I never stopped. I lived in fifth gear. I bought cars. I invested in stocks. I made more money than I had ever imagined.": "Mitch",
  "In my iPod, there are many operas, from A to Z. I have 'Aida' and 'Boheme' and 'Butterfly' and 'Cavalleria'. My passion is for opera, but when I'm in the car, I listen to everything.": "Andrea",
  "You have to maintain the balance between fast growth and smooth growth. It's like driving a car and knowing when to balance the gas pedal and the brake.": "Guo",
  "Win or lose, star or not, you wait for your car with everyone else, and waiting for your car is a drag.": "Teri",
  "In this industry, you have to have passion. It's tough; there's no mercy. But I just love cars - I love to bring a new car to market. And every time I do this, it gets a little easier.": "Henrik",
  "My favorite part of any playdate comes later when I get to carry my exhausted and sleeping daughter to the car. Is there anything more trusting than a sleeping child completely and utterly leaning into your body?": "Nia",
  "I see a future where American companies lead the world in the production of hybrid-plug in cars and electric vehicles.": "Bernie",
  "My dad took me out to see a meteor shower when I was a little kid, and it was scary for me because he woke me up in the middle of the night. My heart was beating; I didn't know what he wanted to do. He wouldn't tell me, and he put me in the car and we went off, and I saw all these people lying on blankets, looking up at the sky.": "Steven",
  "A car is only trouble at a certain point.": "Ryan",
  "This is going to sound ridiculous, but I remember watching 'Boyz n the Hood,' and there is a scene where Cuba Gooding, Jr. gets pressed against a car by a police officer, and he starts crying because it's so humiliating. I remember thinking in that moment that I could totally identify with him, and I'm a little white kid from Canada.": "Ryan",
  "On a bike, being just slightly above pedestrian and car eye level, one gets a perfect view of the goings-on in one's own town.": "David",
  "I'm very fond of Tennessee Williams' plays, and when my husband and I went to New Orleans in the late 1970s, we saw 'A Street Car Named Desire.'": "Ruth",
  "For me, personally, skiing holds everything. I used to race cars, but skiing is a step beyond that. It removes the machinery and puts you one step closer to the elements. And it's a complete physical expression of freedom.": "Robert",
  "The fact is I like Mumbai less and less. My son says, 'Baba, let's go for a drive', and I tell him, 'Where's the fun of a drive in this place?' You get caught in a million traffic jams, and you spend time cooped in your car with all that mad cacophony around you.": "Om",
  "I went to Zimbabwe. I know how white people feel in America now relaxed! Cause when I heard the police car I knew they weren't coming after me! ": "Richard",
  "Yeah, well I think anyone who likes fast cars will love the Tesla. And it has fantastic handling by the way. I mean this car will crush a Porsche on the track, just crush it. So if you like fast cars, you'll love this car. And then oh, by the way, it happens to be electric and it's twice the efficiency of a Prius.": "Elon",
  "My first car was a BMW. A white BMW.": "Jamie-Lynn",
  "We should tell our kids to just have fun, participate and not get bent on winning or losing. But every coach, when they say that, they say it tongue in cheek, 'Don't worry about winning': If you win I'll get you ice cream, but if you lose I'm going to pout in the car.": "Bode",
  "The bass player's function, along with the drums, is to be the engine that drives the car... everything else is merely colours.": "Suzi",
  "A perfect day would be to get into the car, drive out to Yosemite and go camping.": "Michael",
  "Pilots have their names painted just beneath the canopy of their aircraft. This gives the pilot a sense of ownership for his or her jet. What's more, like cars, each aircraft has its own personality, so it's important for a pilot to get to know and love his aircraft.": "Simon",
  "Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do.": "Elon",
  "Electric cars are going to be very important for urban transportation.": "Carlos",
  "My favorite affirmation when I feel stuck or out of sorts is: Whatever I need is already here, and it is all for my highest good. Jot this down and post it conspicuously throughout your home, on the dashboard of your car, at your office, on your microwave oven, and even in front of your toilets!": "Wayne",
  "The subway in New York is a great social experiment there are so many races and ways of life sitting together on each car. ": "Jon",
  "You can't develop a great car and sell it as an independent. You can develop a great car and make a deal with Mercedes.": "Eric",
  "What a piece of garbage this smart car is. There's a commercial - the smart car has zero percent interest for six years. Well, good, I got zero percent in six years in buying this smart car. I'll tell you that much. I mean, it's ridiculous. My buddy has a smart car, totaled it. He hit a deer tick.": "Larry",
  "I think that just sitting down and having casual conversation is the hardest stuff to do. But the extremes? I know what it feels like to come racing around the corner at 90 miles an hour, sliding the car sideways. I know what gear I'm hitting it in when I'm coming around the corner and where I need to downshift. So to me, that's the fun stuff.": "Paul",
  "Whither goest thou, America, in thy shiny car in the night?": "Jack",
  "My husband is pretty particular about his cars. In his opinion, the Mercedes are the best of the best.": "Lauren",
  "We don't sell a car, we sell a dream. We are Italy's national team. There are many great soccer teams in our country, but there is only one Ferrari.": "Luca",
  "I love getting on the subway because you get on the car, and you see the entire human race represented in any given subway car.": "Tim",
  "A life can get knocked into a new orbit by a car crash, a lottery win or just a bleary-eyed consultant giving bad news in a calm voice.": "David",
  "If you own a home with wheels on it and several cars without, you just might be a redneck.": "Jeff",
  "However happy people say they are, nobody is satisfied: we always have to be with the prettiest woman, buy a bigger house, change cars, desire what we do not have.": "Paulo",
  "Like cars, every relationship requires a bit of an occasional service, and fine-tuning should be compulsory.": "Mariella",
  "When you're in a race car, you're going through so many different emotions throughout that race.": "Jeff",
  "I was 16 years old, driving to LA, and sleeping in my car, just trying to make it happen.": "Nick",
  "Driving with one foot on the accelerator and the other on the brake is likely to get you nowhere, but certainly will burn out vital parts of your car. Similarly, cutting taxes on the middle class, but increasing them on the 'rich' is likely to result in an economic burnout.": "Terry",
  "My mother was determined to make us independent. When I was four years old, she stopped the car a few miles from our house and made me find my own way home across the fields. I got hopelessly lost.": "Richard",
  "Relationships, like cars, should undergo regular services to make sure they are still roadworthy.": "Zygmunt",
  "I love speed. I love racing cars, whether it's on the streets or wherever. Don't tell the St. Louis police, though.": "Nelly",
  "When my car runs out of gas, I buy a new one. I don't want to ride around in a quitter.": "Stephen",
  "These songs are old friends I have entertained myself with when I'm washing the dishes, driving to the store and walking down the aisles. The ones that you sing when you're driving in the car and as a singer you always go back to them.": "Al",
  "When you're in your 20s, you're a little more carefree; you're single. You have a very different way of looking at the world and experiencing the world. But later in your 30s, when you have children, a career, career obstacles, mortgages, car payments and relationships, you have to negotiate; that's a very different life.": "Melissa",
  "One time, I was posing on a car for a calendar shoot. I was doused with oil and literally slid off the car, bikini, heels and all!": "Candace",
  "First time I looked at a Formula One car in person, I just stared at the cockpit, figuring I'd never get in there. The drivers wear the whole car like a tight-fitting suit.": "Chris",
  "Part of my problem is that I cannot dispel the myths that have somehow accumulated over the years. Somebody writes something, it's completely off the wall, but it gets filed and repeated until everyone believes it. For instance, I've read that I wear a football helmet in the car.": "Stanley",
  "I have bad reflexes. I was once run over by a car being pushed by two guys.": "Woody",
  "The world is full of abundance and opportunity, but far too many people come to the fountain of life with a sieve instead of a tank car... a teaspoon instead of a steam shovel. They expect little and as a result they get little.": "Ben",
  "We must move away from our dependency on fossil fuels, and I am glad that GM has invested over $1 billion in hydrogen fuel cells cars to meet this goal.": "Albert",
  "At a car dealership, the person who sells the car is the hero, and also gets the commission. But if the mechanics don't service that car well, the customer won't return.": "Roger",
  "How many times have you been on the freeway and had someone fly by you at 100 mph then end up two cars ahead of you at the off ramp? What's the point?": "Mark",
  "I'm addicted to laughing. I go to see a lot of comedy shows. I'm addicted to playing really loud and obnoxious rock music in my car. I'm addicted to beautiful clothes and shoes. I just love gorgeous stuff and work hard to acquire pretty things, shiny things. I'm addicted to shiny things!": "Nadia",
  "'Blind Curve,' the book I'm working on now, sprang from a crazy incident that happened to me last year while on my book tour. I was pulled out of my car for a minor traffic violation - an incident that escalated into my being thrown into cuffs and told I was going to jail. Except in my story, the hero doesn't get off as easily as I did.": "Andrew",
  "Part of us believes the new car is better because it lasts longer. But, in fact, that's the worst thing about the new car. It will stay around to disappoint you, whereas a trip to Europe is over. It evaporates. It has the good sense to go away, and you are left with nothing but a wonderful memory.": "Daniel",
  "I don't think I'm a good ol' boy. Honestly, the last thing I am is a redneck. I like silk sheets, fancy cars, beautiful women, good whiskey.": "Joe",
  "I was homeless for almost a year and a half, just living in my car or bouncing around peoples' houses, going to 7-Eleven at the end of the day and asking them for the taquitos that they were going to throw out because I hadn't eaten in two days.": "Andy",
  "A broad margin of leisure is as beautiful in a man's life as in a book. Haste makes waste, no less in life than in housekeeping. Keep the time, observe the hours of the universe, not of the cars.": "Henry",
  "By the end of the 1950s, American cars were so reliable that their reliability went without saying even in car ads. Thousands of them bear testimony to this today, still running on the roads of Cuba though fueled with nationalized Venezuelan gasoline and maintained with spit and haywire.": "P.",
  "In Copenhagen, there's a long-term commitment to creating a well-functioning pedestrian city where all forms of movement - pedestrian, bicycles, cars, public transportation - are accommodated with equal priority.": "Bjarke",
  "I try to get away from the pits as quickly as I can. I speak to my engineer when I get out of the car, usually there's some press to do, then I will go off and have a shower and get my dry, clean overalls and clothing on. I'll have a massage, stretch and something to eat. I don't sleep, but I try to close my eyes for a while.": "Allan",
  "Americans are the only people in the world known to me whose status anxiety prompts them to advertise their college and university affiliations in the rear window of their automobiles.": "Paul",
  "I don't run a car, have never run a car. I could say that this is because I have this extremely tender environmentalist conscience, but the fact is I hate driving.": "David",
  "I don't like new cars I'm into vintage cars - there's a Jaguar E-Type in the 'Goldie' video. ": "ASAP",
  "I'm afraid we'll see reporters stop chasing quotes around the same time dogs stop chasing cars.": "Daniel",
  "Long after the bomb falls and you and your good deeds are gone, cockroaches will still be here, prowling the streets like armored cars.": "Tama",
  "If I start outsourcing all my navigation to a little talking box in my car, I'm sort of screwed. I'm going to lose my car in the parking lot every single time.": "Ken",
  "I remember being at Greenblatt's on Sunset, and some guy just walked straight up to me, and he had some bling on and whatever, and said something about a party down in Malibu and asked if I would jump in his car and go to the party. All I could think was, 'Who are you? I don't know you, and I don't care about how good your car is.'": "Yvonne",
  "Winter in the country is very white. There is black grit on all the shoulders of the roads and on the big mounds from the plows, and all the cars are filthy, but the fields are dazzling and untouched and pristine.": "Susan",
  "Tailor Made will help Ferrari's clients tailor their cars in a very personal, specific way. It's a bespoke service, like visiting Huntsman or Anderson & Sheppard or whoever your favourite Savile Row tailor is.": "Lapo",
  "I like Mercedes because my wife has been in two big accidents and emerged without a scratch, thanks to the safety of these cars.": "Nobu",
  "You can't tell what's aboard a container ship. We carried every kind of cargo, all of it on view: a police car, penicillin, Johnnie Walker Red, toilets, handguns, lumber, Ping-Pong balls, and IBM data cards.": "Christopher",
  "We were racing at circuits where there were no crash barriers in front of the pits, and fuel was lying about in churns in the pit lane. A car could easily crash into the pits at any time. It was ridiculous.": "Jackie",
  "Get in the race car do what I do then go home. We don't have freedom to do anything anymore.": "Tony",
  "Cars, furs, and gems were not my weaknesses.": "Gene",
  "Normally in dangerous situations I have a getaway car.": "Sacha",
  "When life was worrying about a car payment or a rent payment and a bill, you're so consumed with that, you really don't have time to know yourself. That's surviving and getting by.": "Fred",
  "Parking is a nightmare for me... I still have sensors on my car that help me park.": "Jordana",
  "Electric cars are not going to take the market by storm, but it's going to be a gradual improvement.": "Carlos",
  "Kill all the rich people. Break up their cars and apartments. Bring the revolution home, kill your parents, that's where it's really at.": "Bill",
  "You can know or not know how a car runs and still enjoy riding in a car.": "David",
  "Often motivated by a desire to maintain the existing status quo, sloth almost cost the U.S. its auto industry, as it refused for decades to build fuel-efficient cars to compete with Japanese, Korean and European imports.": "Simon",
  "My first car was a 1976 Toyota Corolla Liftback in red, like the one in 'The Blues Brothers.' I painted a Union Jack on the roof. I was absolutely in love with it until I destroyed it, which broke my heart!": "Richard",
  "Okay, let's talk about cartoon labels for half a second - some people think anything with a dog or a car or a colorful alien is garbage, which is not true. Look at Big Moose Red. It's, like, a $6 wine with a cheesy label, and it's actually a solid wine.": "Gary",
  "My first car was an '84 Ford Taurus. It caught on fire from me trying to change the fuel pump, so that wasn't good at all. Dried leaves on the ground while I was trying to change the fuel pump. Don't do that. Do it on concrete.": "T-Pain",
  "I hate the technological rip-offs that pass for music formats these days, and go back to vinyl to hear a good record because the sound is always so much fuller. I don't even like listening to music in the car.": "John",
  "In an automobile, if you think about the navigation system - of all the cars in the world, four out of five cars in the world if they have a navigation system have something from Nokia inside that car - the data, the platform, something. So we play a very strong role there.": "Stephen",
  "The first thing I ever rode when I was a kid was a motorcycle, so I knew how to drive a motorcycle before a car.": "John",
  "Nothing's ever too fast. Maybe sometimes on the road some people are too fast if they don't know how to control the car, but in racing, the faster and more power and grip, the better it is.": "Heikki",
  "The reason I moved to California the first time was to build the Cobra. I thought it was stupid to have a 1918 taxicab engine in what Europeans like to call a performance car when a little American V-8 could do the job better.": "Carroll",
  "I drive the same car that I've driven since I was 16. That's who I am.": "Selena",
  "I don't even possess a car. I ride in auto-rickshaws because I like to be a part of the masses. I don't want to single myself out as someone up and above.": "Shakuntala",
  "When I was a kid in Nebraska, a cantankerous farmer, known for plinking with his '22 at passing cars in which he perceived enemies, ingeniously rigged up a shotgun in his house, trained on the inside of his front door so as to widely distribute any intruder.": "Dick",
  "My friend is a former race car driver, so he races for Mercedes, and I root for him. I have a car that I love to race, I'll take it to the track.": "Hill",
  "We loved cars until the '70s or so. Then they became appliances. They turned into motorized cup holders. Most of it has to do with urban sprawl. What began as pleasure ends up in necessity, as so many things do.": "P.",
  "Even we schoolchildren know that ordinary diplomats don't drive around in unmarked cars carrying Glock pistols.": "Malala",
  "I thought boxes were the best toy. When my parents got a new car, I ran to my mother and said, 'Did it come in a box?'": "Colin",
  "When I was 10, I was hit by a car, which turned my right tibia into a jigsaw puzzle.": "John",
  "If you think about jeans or phones or television, we are used to new brands popping up right and left. But in the car industry, we grew up with Mercedes, BMW, General Motors, and Ford, and nobody can remember during his or her upbringing a new car brand coming to life.": "Henrik",
  "One can find a squalid America as easily as a scenic America; a bitter, hopeless America as easily as the confident America of polyethylene wrapping, new cars, and camping trips in the summer.": "Robert",
  "There definitely will be flying cars, but whether there'll be flying cars for most people to use, it'll probably take a long time to straighten everything out, all the rules and hassles. It'll take a while to figure out how to keep people from crashing into each other.": "Zack",
  "I was raised in Chicago and I guess that was one of the special breeding grounds for gangsters of all colors. That was the Detroit of the gangster world. The car industry was thugs.": "Quincy",
  "For me, being in a car or on an airplane is like being in limbo. It's this dead zone between two places. But to walk, you're some place that's already interesting. You're not just between places. Things are happening.": "Rebecca",
  "There's an unseen force which lets birds know when you've just washed your car.": "Denis",
  "I think the true test of a pop song, for me, and I've talked to a lot of other writers about this, is you take your demo, you pop it in your car and you drive down Sunset Blvd. to Santa Monica, and that's the Hollywood car test.": "Ryan",
  "I don't listen to the radio, cause I don't have a driver's license. But if I'm in L.A. or somewhere where we have to rent a car, I'll hear my songs. Sometimes I hear them when I'm in stores, and I'm still like a little kid in a candy shop: 'Oh my God, that's my song!' I don't know how that could ever get old.": "Benny",
  "Car designers are just going to have to come up with an automobile that outlasts the payments.": "Erma",
  "You're safer in the race car than you are in cars going to and from the track.": "Mario",
  "In less enlightened times, the best way to impress women was to own a hot car. But women wised up and realized it was better to buy their own hot cars so they wouldn't have to ride around with jerks.": "Scott",
  "Consider what kind of car you get. Buy cars and other products that have the least impact environmentally.": "Al",
  "Perhaps people, and kids especially, are spoiled today, because all the kids today have cars, it seems. When I was young you were lucky to have a bike.": "James",
  "I was brought up in a car family, my dad loved cars and I was taught the art of making an Austin 7 operate.": "Nick",
  "I liken myself to Henry Ford and the auto industry, I give you 90 percent of what most people need.": "Adam",
  "Driving race cars was an avenue for me to learn how to build my own car, and that was my ambition all along.": "Carroll",
  "Back in the mid-1970s, we adopted some fairly ambitious goals to improve efficiency of our cars. What did we get? We got a tremendous boost in efficiency.": "Jay",
  "The automobile, both a cause and an effect of this decentralization, is ideally suited for our vast landscape and our generally confused and contrary commuting patterns.": "Brock",
  "Ikea people do not drive flashy cars or stay at luxury hotels.": "Ingvar",
  "Tesla is here to stay and keep fighting for the electric car revolution.": "Elon",
  "I am a big car enthusiast. I totally understand guys like Jay Leno who have a thousand cars. But asking me my favorite car would be like asking my favorite song or favorite food - it changes everyday.": "Casey",
  "If you don't drink, smoke, or drive a car, you're a tax evader.": "Thomas",
  "Going to church doesn't make you any more a Christian than going to the garage makes you a car.": "Laurence",
  "In Paris, one is always reminded of being a foreigner. If you park your car wrong, it is not the fact that it's on the sidewalk that matters, but the fact that you speak with an accent.": "Roman",
  "The lead car is unique, except for the one behind it which is identical.": "Murray",
  "Nobody's ever asked me to pay for a meal before I've eaten it, I've never been pulled over just because I was driving the wrong kind of car in the wrong kind of area at the wrong time of night.": "Wentworth",
  "I am really looking forward to driving another of my father's car at the show in Rotterdam.": "Nelson",
  "I was already on pole, then by half a second and then one second and I just kept going. Suddenly I was nearly two seconds faster than anybody else, including my team mate with the same car.": "Ayrton",
  "In 1950, when the Giants signed me, they gave me $15,000. I bought a 1950 Mercury. I couldn't drive, but I had it in the parking lot there, and everybody that could drive would drive the car. So it was like a community thing.": "Willie",
  "Shutting off the thought process is not rejuvenating the mind is like a car battery - it recharges by running. ": "Bill",
  "My brother was a lifeguard in a car wash.": "Henny",
  "I never had the high-paying job or the company car. It took me over a decade to pay off my student loans. I never had to worry about where to dock my yacht to reduce my taxes.": "Christine",
  "People would say you look weak if you're not cursing the opposition and driving around in a big black car while always wearing a tie. Above all, to be 'strong' you're always supposed to be giving orders.": "George",
  "If you don't have the story and the unfolding of the trajectory of the saga, it's like getting in a car and not having any gas.": "Gus",
  "I accept the Old Testament as more of an action movie: blood, car chases, evacuations, a lot of special effects, seas dividing, mass murder, adultery. The children of God are running amok, wayward. Maybe that's why they're so relatable.": "Bono",
  "The biggest thrill a ballplayer can have is when your son takes after you. That happened when my Bobby was in his championship Little League game. He really showed me something. Struck out three times. Made an error that lost the game. Parents were throwing things at our car and swearing at us as we drove off. Gosh, I was proud.": "Bob",
  "Sometimes I wish I could drive a car, but I'm gonna drive a car one day, so I don't worry about that.": "Stevie",
  "Factory farming is one of the biggest contributors to the most serious environmental problems. The meat industry causes more greenhouse gas emissions than all the cars, trucks, planes and ships in the world.": "Joan",
  "I've always been into cars. Cars are part of our genetic makeup. It's unavoidable.": "Matthew",
  "Every day I get to 'Think' and work on everything from digitizing electric grids so they can accommodate renewable energy and enable mass adoption of electric cars, helping major cities reduce congestion and pollution, to developing new micro-finance programs that help tiny businesses get started in markets such as Brazil, India, Africa.": "Ginni",
  "I was always an observer, even as a child. I could be satisfied to sit in a car for 3 hours and just look at the street go by while my mother went shopping.": "Jonathan",
  "I used to have this Mercedes, a dark blue 450SLC, which was the most beautiful car. I'd like to have another unusual, beautiful car.": "Andrew",
  "Devices are getting smarter - your television, your car - and that means more data spread around. There needs to be a fabric that connects all these devices. That's what we do.": "Drew",
  "I did plenty of jobs that I hated. I was a bank teller and terrible at it. I parked cars, a valet. I answered phones. I somehow avoided being a waiter. I knew I wouldn't be able to keep the order straight. I'm not much of a multi-tasker.": "Will",
  "I rolled the second car that I ever owned, a Toyota 4 Runner. This was winter in Colorado, two weeks before the 2002 Olympic trials. I was driving in the outside lane, and my rear tire caught some black ice, and we totally turned sideways to the point where we were heading right toward the median.": "Apolo",
  "No matter how good a driver you are, you have to have the right car and the right team behind you in order to succeed.": "Nico",
  "If mass media, social isolation in the suburbs, alienating workplaces and long car commutes create a bunker mentality, the Internet does the opposite.": "Alex",
  "When you drive your car, E = mc2 is at work. As the engine burns gasoline to produce energy in the form of motion, it does so by converting some of the gasoline's mass into energy, in accord with Einstein's formula.": "Brian",
  "Trying to run Congress without human relationships is like trying to run a car without motor oil. Should we be surprised when the whole thing freezes up?": "Jonathan",
  "I never bothered with cars. I was probably one of the few kids in school who didn't run around with hot-rod magazines. As I would be at home fiddling with my guitar, they would be fiddling with a car engine.": "Angus",
  "I always try to say, 'If you want to help the environment, try to do just two things. One, use less of your car. Second, separate your garbage.'": "Jaime",
  "In the early nineties, I was a cub reporter on a city newspaper in Limerick, and assigned to the courthouse there. One day, an old detective sergeant came and whispered to me in the press pit. He pointed out a young offender, a teenager who was up for stealing a car or something relatively minor, and said, 'See this kid? He'll kill.'": "Kevin",
  "I hate to take compromises with a racing car. The more standard a car is, the more compromises you have to take.": "Michael",
  "We should be licensing everybody with a gun. I have to have a license for my dog. I have to have a license for my car. If you're going to do my hair later you have to have a license... We don't require a license to own a firearm?": "Michael",
  "I drive an American car. It's a Chrysler. That's not an endorsement. It's more like a cry for pity.": "Michael",
  "We're very good in America at talking about stuff, often stuff to buy. We tend to talk about our iPods. We tend to talk about cars or new fads.": "Milton",
  "Marketers use big data profiling to predict who is about to get pregnant, who is likely to buy a new car, and who is about to change sexual orientations. That's how they know what ads to send to whom. The NSA, meanwhile, wants to know who is likely to commit an act of terrorism - and for this, they need us.": "Douglas",
  "I am really interested in eccentric minds. It's rather like being fascinated by how cars work. It's really boring if your car works all the time. But as soon as something happens, you get the bonnet up. If someone has an abnormal or dysfunctional state of mind, you get the bonnet up.": "Mark",
  "I've loved car racing all my life. I watch NASCAR regularly, and drag racing because we have Raceway Park in New Jersey. I think I got it from my father.": "Queen",
  "I get labelled as just being about one thing, but there's lots of layers to what I do. It's just lazy journalism, but people start to accept it. If people spent an hour in my car driving around London and listening to the stuff I listen to, they'd hear some interesting stuff.": "Paul",
  "My first car was, as depicted in 'Sleepwalk with Me,' my mother's '92 Volvo station wagon that had 80,000 miles on it, and I had put 40,000 miles on it, so by the time it retired it had 120,000, and I basically killed it. It served me well, and my mechanic was always very angry with me because I just didn't properly care for it.": "Mike",
  "I've always listened to a lot of rap. It's all, 'Look at this car that cost me so much money, look at this Champagne.' It's super fun.": "Lorde",
  "Suburban sprawl leads to social atomisation and fragmentation and is environmentally disastrous, as carbon-intensive car journeys displace local shops and replace public transport.": "Richard",
  "I don't believe in the electric cars, but I strongly believe in hybrids.": "Luca",
  "A Republican philosophy goes something like this: If you take your car to the mechanic, and instead of fixing it, they take out the engine and charge you an arm and a leg, you should conclude that mechanics can't fix cars and you should probably just take yours to the junkyard and sell it for scrap metal.": "Keith",
  "After I joined Toyota, there was a period when I drove more than 200 cars in one year - different types, other companies' cars. I want to be able to tell what distinguishes one car from the next.": "Akio",
  "Russia does not have a modern economy: it's a petro-power. The only thing it sells that the world wants to buy is oil and natural gas. When was the last time anyone bought a Russian computer? A Russian car? A Russian cell phone? Russia is so dependent on high energy prices that if oil falls below $100 a barrel, the Kremlin can't meet payroll.": "Kathleen",
  "As the son of a racing car designer and mechanical engineer, I was exposed to motorsports from day one.": "Charlie",
  "Deprived of the opportunity to judge one another by the cars we drive, New Yorkers, thrown together daily on mass transit, form silent opinions based on our choices of subway reading. Just by glimpsing the cover staring back at us, we can reach the pinnacle of carnal desire or the depths of hatred. Soul mate or mortal enemy.": "David",
  "There are signs, I think, that people aren't satisfied by consumerism: that people resent the fact that the most moral decision in their lives is choosing what colour their next car will be.": "J.",
  "I just love cars I've been like that since I was a kid. It's an infatuation because we grew up poor. Cars was something we were always trying to get. ": "Birdman",
  "With this film, 'Need For Speed,' with this, we had a blank canvas to work with. What we had to do was have fast cars, and that's it.": "Aaron",
  "I remember one day, when things were going frightfully well, I went to buy myself a really smashing car. I asked them to show me a Porsche with an automatic gearbox, and the salesman called over all the other salesmen, and they stood around absolutely roaring with laughter.": "Mary",
  "To look out of a car in Scania, you see a painting on the horizontal - one windmill, one tiny farmhouse, acres of beet or grass.": "Kenneth",
  "Why make a movie about Ayrton Senna? Someone who drove around in circles at 200mph in a car that looked like a giant cigarette packet? Why would anyone who isn't already a fan of Formula 1 care?": "Asif",
  "When you're setting up a budget, a general rule is to start with your fixed expenses - your housing and insurance payments, and car payment, if you own one.": "Jean",
  "Beijing was such a different city. There were so few cars, I could walk in the middle of the road. In the summer, the streetlamps attracted swirling bugs. I loved those bugs: crickets, praying mantis, all kinds of beetles. I also have a vivid memory of dazzling sunlight coming out of the sky.": "Ma",
  "I'm way flashier on Instagram and Snapchat because I feel like that's what people want to see, and that's I've always done, so I'm not going to stop. People want to see my cars and my purses. People love fashion. But that's so not me.": "Kylie",
  "When I turned 18, I lost my best friend to a car accident.": "Sebastian",
  "Car ownership as we know it will change. The promise of car ownership of the past, the freedom of open roads... the reality has been more of a burden.": "John",
  "When I was growing up as a young lesbian in the '50s, I looked in vain for books about my people. I did find some paperbacks with lurid covers in the local bus station, but they ended with the gay character's committing suicide, dying in a car crash, being sent to a mental hospital, or 'turning' heterosexual.": "Nancy",
  "Now and then, when I grow nostalgic about my ocean childhood - the wauling of gulls and the smell of salt, somebody solicitous will bundle me into a car and drive me to the nearest briny horizon.": "Sylvia",
  "Whatever I think of, that's what I do. I wake up and think, 'I want to buy a car', I buy a car. I wake up and be like, 'I just want to lay in bed with my girl', I do that. I wake up and want to rap, I rap. So whatever I think of.": "Young",
  "Beyond self-driving cars, I think all airplanes should go pilotless. Get the pilots out of there. Even better, have no cockpit at all, and turn it into a nice lounge with a bar. Why give people the illusion of control with a steering wheel?": "Steve",
  "Maybe I'm the only footballer who isn't interested in cars. My Lancia Y gets me around.": "Gianluigi",
  "Naming me 'Twinkle' was a foolproof way of making sure that I would get teased throughout my life, have immigration officers at various airports stare at my passport and shake with hysterical laughter, and strangers stalk me with WhatsApp messages like, 'Twinkle, Twinkle, little star, I hope you get hit by a car!'": "Twinkle",
  "When I turned 16 and got my license, the Chevy Blazer was passed down from my sister, so it was very much a starter car.": "Amy",
  "Every home that I have is paid for, every car that I have is paid for, and I am a hundred-million-dollar man. I mean, this is the truth; it's not a lie.": "Floyd",
  "Stephanie and I got married publicly on the beach, in front of friends and family, and the local police shut down the highway for us to cross the street back to my cousin's house. Cars backed up for miles, and everybody in town cheered.": "Tig",

  "Luck, like a Russian car, generally only works if you push it.": "Tom",
  "Simply racing a Formula 1 car is an achievement.": "Sebastian",
  "I was a little troublemaker. Always trying to get in trouble, always mischief, like throwing rocks at cars when I was younger, all that kind of stuff.": "Ryan",
  "I don't think I'm a celebrity. I'm just a guy from east Texas who loves cars and airplanes.": "Carroll",
  "We go through the whole season working on next season's car and developing the car and making sure we fit in the car and all that sort of stuff. And we obviously give ideas of what we would hope next year's car would have even if it's small things like buttons on the steering wheel and different positions and whatever.": "Jenson",
  "I'm fascinated by the narrative of geology, and I'm a veritable pack rat of a collector on the road. I keep a rock hammer in my car.": "Marianne",
  "The Italians and Spanish, the Chinese and Vietnamese see food as part of a larger, more essential and pleasurable part of daily life. Not as an experience to be collected or bragged about - or as a ritual like filling up a car - but as something else that gives pleasure, like sex or music, or a good nap in the afternoon.": "Anthony",
  "Move to Italy. I mean it: they know about living in debt; they don't care. I stayed out there for five months while I was making a film called 'Order Of Death,' and they've really got it sussed. Nice cars. Sharp suits. Great food. Stroll into work at 10. Lunch from 12 till three. Leave work at five. That's living!": "John",
  "One of the things that's interesting to me is I find things like caffeine and stunts actually relax me. When they're putting a bit of gel on my arm and lighting me on fire, or when I'm about to go into a high-speed car chase or rev a motorcycle up pretty fast, I find everything else around me slows down.": "Nicolas",
  "I find people interesting. People trying hard are interesting. People with a passion are interesting - whether it's old cars or taxidermy or knitting.": "Clare",
  "It's not good just to have life experience of film-making and that's all. It's hard to play a real person when you've been in jets and town cars for three years.": "Ryan",
  "My wife loves cars, but the difference is she doesn't have 20 years of understanding the background of them. She basically drives them and uses her gut feelings as to which is best.": "Tim",
  "Caution is the key to safe cycling. I'm aware that cars are bigger than me, but I feel quite safe. I'm in control, liberated and free, when I'm on my bike.": "Erin",
  "I love driving my car on any highway.": "Virat",
  "I've always saved. I believe in keeping money back for a rainy day and living within my means. I don't buy expensive clothes; I have a 10-year-old car I'm hoping to replace when a big job comes in. I suppose when we do go on family holidays, I am quite happy to spend when we are there.": "Sanjeev",
  "I had a friend who was a plastic surgeon, so he would do little things. I never had, like, a full thing. So I would go in maybe once every two or three years, and he'd do a little here, a little there; tweak you, like you tweak your car. Then I became the plastic surgery poster girl.": "Joan",
  "Parallel parking is desirable for two reasons: parked cars create a physical barrier and psychological buffer that protects pedestrians on the sidewalk from moving vehicles; and a rich supply of parallel parking can eliminate the need for parking lots, which are extremely destructive of the civic fabric.": "James",
  "We designed a car that is for daily commutes and that you charge every day. The less you use the gasoline engine, the better mpg. Essentially, the Karma can achieve dramatic savings and low CO2 output when used as intended, as a daily commuter.": "Henrik",
  "If I can drive down the road in my car and listen to XM satellite, and when a song gets beamed into my car, it can tell me who wrote the song and what the damn lyrics are, why, when you broadcast a digital signal of a film, can't it speak to your television to set up a list of settings to show the film in the way that it was meant to be shown?": "Jeff",
  "I always think of the good comebacks on the car ride home.": "Ron",
  "I don't like to feel like I'm in a club when I'm in my car and I turn on the radio. Anything that ceases to be a song and just sounds like house music kind of stresses me out.": "Taylor",

  "Cars mean nothing to me. I'm not a car guy.": "Penn",
  "If you're in a car crash, you're mostly involved in trying to not go off the bridge, and later on you say, 'Oh my God!'": "Ben",
  "I have some wonderful suits in my closet, a lovely car, some refined watches.": "Pierce",
  "I did not want to spend the rest of my life not being able to ride in a nice car.": "Shakira",
  "Cars can have a hypnotic effect. You can get in a car and get out and not really remember the trip.": "Ryan",
  "From the 1920s into the 1940s, Britain's standard of living was supported by oil from Iran. British cars, trucks, and buses ran on cheap Iranian oil. Factories throughout Britain were fueled by oil from Iran. The Royal Navy, which projected British power all over the world, powered its ships with Iranian oil.": "Stephen",
  "Enough Americans saw fit to give president Obama a second term. I don't think there will be many people keeping their Romney/Ryan bumper stickers on their cars.": "Henry",
  "Flying cars are not a very efficient way to move things from one point to another.": "Bill",
  "When Ford sells a car, a dealer isn't allowed to take out the engine and put a different one in. When a newsstand sells the Washington Post, no one can go to the newsstand and pay them to rip out the classified section and put their own classified section in - if they could, they would do so.": "Bill",
  "Some day you will be wheeled in for a heart bypass operation, and a surgeon will be the person who is now behind the counter when you renew your car registration at the department of motor vehicles.": "P.",
  "I come from Toledo, Ohio, a town that has been hurt badly by the shift of the automobile business towards Japan. And yet I remember how the car workers lived in the neighborhood that I grew up in. My father was a car salesman, and I remember how we lived. I remember how modestly we lived.": "P.",
  "I spent a lot of time behind the Iron Curtain, and their cars were abysmal.": "P.",
  "I like Michael Moore, but I think of him more as a rabble-rouser. On his TV show, when he went to the home of the guy who invented the car alarm and set off all the car alarms on the block... pretty funny.": "P.",
  "When I'm in the car, I want the only one shouting to be me.": "P.",
  "Cars let us out of the barn and, while they were at it, destroyed the American nuclear family. As anyone who has had an American nuclear family can tell you, this was a relief to all concerned.": "P.",
  "My whole family can talk. They are all car salesmen. They are all funny.": "P.",
  "The killjoys initiated automobile crash standards so rigorous that we can't buy a car that hasn't been dropped from the top of a phone pole with our whole family strapped inside.": "P.",
  "As a little boy, I wanted to be a policeman. And then as I got older, and I saw my dad in the car business, an automobile executive.": "Mitt",
  "I love cars; I like the idea of manufacturing something, having a product, a hard product to sell and promote, but as time went on, I recognized that car companies are so bureaucratic and so ossified that it would take forever to work your way up. And so I went into consulting.": "Mitt",
  "My dad was phenomenal. Born in Mexico, lived poor, didn't graduate from college, and becomes head of a car company and then governor of a state. I can't imagine I would have ever thought about running for office had I not seen my dad do it.": "Mitt",
  "I like American cars. And I would do nothing to hurt the U.S. auto industry.": "Mitt",
  "Rebellion is what you make of it. When you've been on a tour bus for two months straight, and then you get in your car and drive wherever you want, that can feel rebellious.": "Taylor",
  "Things in themselves have no life in them. A car can't comfort or encourage you. A house means nothing if there's no life and love inside.": "Joyce",
  "I tell people, and it's the truth, I could sit in my garage for a week and it won't make me a car. And you can sit in church till your bottom is flat and that won't make you a servant of Christ.": "Joyce",
  "I have an answering machine in my car. It says, I'm home now. But leave a message and I'll call when I'm out.": "Steven",
  "I'm gonna be making records anyway, even if I had to sell 'em out of the trunk of my car. I'm that kind of musician and singer.": "Dolly",
  "Nobody can ever make enough money for as many poor relatives as I've got. Somebody's got a sick kid, or somebody needs an operation, somebody ain't got this, somebody ain't got that. Or to give the kids all a car when they graduate.": "Dolly",
  "Canadians can easily 'pass for American' as long as we don't accidentally use metric measurements or apologize when hit by a car.": "Douglas",
  "If God drives a car, He'd drive a 1973 Ford LTD Brougham sedan with a claret-colored vinyl roof, with oxblood leather upholstery and an opera window.": "Douglas",
  "Theater in New York is nearer to the street. In London, you have to go deep into the building, usually, to reach the place where theater happens. On Broadway, only the fire doors separate you from the sidewalk, and you're lucky if the sound of a police car doesn't rip the envelope twice a night.": "Tom",
  "Tesla is becoming a real car company.": "Elon",
  "Winning 'Motor Trend' Car of the year is probably the closest thing to winning the Oscar or Emmy of the car industry.": "Elon",
  "A Prius is not a true hybrid, really. The current Prius is, like, 2 percent electric. It's a gasoline car with slightly better mileage.": "Elon",
  "I think Tesla will most likely develop its own autopilot system for the car, as I think it should be camera-based, not Lidar-based. However, it is also possible that we do something jointly with Google.": "Elon",
  "Some companies out there quote a start of production that is substantially in advance of when customers get their cars.": "Elon",
  "I like the word 'autopilot' more than I like the word 'self-driving.' 'Self-driving' sounds like it's going to do something you don't want it to do. 'Autopilot' is a good thing to have in planes, and we should have it in cars.": "Elon",
  "The U.S. automotive industry has been selling cars the same way for over 100 years, and there are many laws in place to govern exactly how that is to be accomplished.": "Elon",
  "People concerned about inflation today tend to buy big houses and nice cars.": "Robert",

  "The greatest pleasure when I started making money was not buying cars or yachts but finding myself able to have as many freshly typed drafts as possible.": "Gore",
  "I was a pizza delivery boy at the Pizza Oven in Canton. I wanted to get fired so bad, I actually wrecked the delivery car, but they wouldn't fire me because I was the only person they had working there.": "Marilyn",
  "If a kid is old enough to drive a car or buy a gun, isn't he old enough to be held personally responsible for what he does with his car or gun? Or if he's a teenager, should someone else be blamed because he isn't as enlightened as an eighteen-year-old?": "Marilyn",
  "My hair is way, way long. I've hitchhiked across the country a zillion times. I've ridden in every car. I was never a hippie. It takes more than long hair.": "Penn",
  "To drive a car in rural America is freedom. Before I had a car, I'd never seen a rock and roll show, I'd never seen a comic or a show.": "Penn",
  "I've never revved my car at a light for an attractive woman or an auto-rival, not even as a joke.": "Penn",
  "It's always the big question in our lives if you have a lot of success. What do you do with it? Buy more houses, buy more cars, buy more stuff, be wealthy and distant and unengaged? Or do you take all that good fortune that has come towards you and spread the love, do something with it?": "Kevin",
  "I'm not someone who wears shades all the time and ducks into a darkened car in case I'm recognized - that would be absolute misery.": "Ian",
  "If you come down to it, there's only a handful of worlds that action films live in. You have your car chases, your gun fights, and your fights.": "James",
  "I think, ultimately, if you create characters that people like and can relate to, your characters are grounded on a human level even if your cars are not.": "James",
  "I never saw anything funny in a car commercial - but that's OK. Whatever they wanted to do - it's their product and I'm the spokesperson, and I'm going to deliver.": "Bill",
  "Both of my parents have been actors there were a lot of show tunes on in the car all of the time. I grew up with that. ": "Daniel",
  "I don't know what to do with it. I'm very fortunate to have it, and it gives you room to maneuver. But the main thing about having money is it means you don't have to worry about it. And that for me is a lovely thing. It's not for fast cars and hookers.": "Daniel",
  "My parents were what I like to call proper musical fans. Lots of Sondheim was played in the car.": "Daniel",
  "People who have car collections - I never understood that. I always thought that was unnecessary. It's not beautiful, it's not creative. It's just showing how much money you've got.": "Daniel",
  "I grew up listening to show tunes in the back of the car.": "Daniel",
  "There are races and then there are races. And without a doubt, the Indy 500 is the race that I've always wanted to attend. And now, to be driving the Corvette Pace Car... this is going to be unbelievable.": "Guy",
  "I have to have energy because I have a lot of expenses. A couple of cars, couple of dogs and a big estate.": "Don",
  "I've spent more on my Dodger tickets that I did on my car.": "Shia",
  "My first car, I got it in an auction at my temple. It was an '86 Volvo that I got for 500 bucks, and then wound up throwing $10,000 into the stereo system and put TVs in the foot rests. It was the most ridiculous Volvo you'd ever seen, but I had never had money before and I was out of my mind.": "Shia",
  "I don't have any expensive habits. I'm not a car collector or any of that nonsense. But I'd love to be incredibly wealthy for no reason at all.": "John",
  "I don't have huge bank accounts. I'd love one. But it wouldn't change much. I don't have any expensive habits. I'm not a car collector or any of that nonsense. But I'd love to be incredibly wealthy for no reason at all.": "John",
  "The most important loan to pay is your student loan. It's more important than your mortgage, car and credit card payments. You cannot discharge student loan debt in the majority of cases.": "Suze",
  "The prenup needs to be drawn up months before the wedding, not days - it's not something you slap together and sign in the car on the way to the ceremony. A shotgun prenup might not hold up in court.": "Suze",
  "Everything I've been thinking, every vision, even down to every shot I throw, it just ends up here in reality. Whether it was in a fight and how to react or whether it was in a stadium with screaming fans or whether I was in a fancy car or the best clothes ever, I always put myself somewhere.": "Conor",
  "I don't mind a little Sturm und Drang. When I was doing 'Riding in Cars With Boys,' I wouldn't smile at anybody, because my character, Bev, was angry at the world. I'm the opposite. Inside my head I'd be like, God, I'll explain to you at the end of shooting that I'm not this person.": "Drew",
  "At least in making an action film, there's always going to be someone who wants to see a car chase. Even if a lot of the people don't like it, there will be a lot of people that do. But bad comedy is just garbage.": "Jason",
  "I'm into all things German. Everything that I own is German. As far as cars go, anyway.": "Jason",
  "I've always had a fascination with cars and racing, not that I've ever competed.": "Jason",
  "During the season, most of my time to unwind is in my car ride home. When I get home, it's being with my kids.": "Tom",
  "I think I'm a survivor. I could have suffered at least 100 professional deaths. I could come up with a list of the 100 times I've come closest to death, from having pneumonia as a child to car crashes.": "Craig",
  "We've become such a multitasking society that just paying attention to the road doesn't seem to be that important anymore. I have to remind my kids all the time that that's what you're supposed to be doing in the car.": "Andie",
  "A car is a 2,000 pound projectile that can go 100 miles an hour.": "Jesse",
  "I don't race cars.": "Dwayne",

  "I've actually stopped tinting my windows because the paparazzi look for trucks and cars with supertinted windows.": "Megan",
  "I don't think any rapper can go back. You can be a car salesman, a bank teller - I mean, really good jobs, and people are still gonna look at you and be like, 'You used to rap; what happened?'": "Jay-Z",
  "I never wanted to just glamorize the playa lifestyle and not touch on the down side. I wanted everyone who's in a desperate situation to know that, if they wanna choose that kinda lifestyle, they gotta be aware of everything that comes with it! It's not just about the cars, the ladies and the money.": "Jay-Z",
  "I would love to be on 'Top Gear' as a star in a reasonably priced car.": "Sandra",
  "Guns do kill. Unlike cars, that is all they do.": "Molly",
  "Why young men from the country become firefighters is hard to explain to people who are not from the country. For most of us, it's not about the rush, which fades with time, or the paycheck. We could earn more working for the railroad or a car dealership. I figure it's about the land.": "Matthew",
  "I cannot drive very well. I drive slow and very safe. I don't know cars that well.": "Selena",
  "When my mother and I walked to the grocery store, men would circle the block in cars. It was very, very scary, especially as a young boy. Very predatory - a hunt.": "Ryan",
  "First of all, I have to have trucks because I live most of my time on a horse farm, so I've gotta have trucks. It's in the northeast; I've got to have pickup trucks to move snow, number one. Number two, just if I'm driving, I don't have to have an SUV, but I want a big car.": "Denis",
  "I talk to myself, especially in the car.": "Chris",
  "I love the '40s. I love the '50s. I love the style, I love the clothes. I love how the women looked. I love the dances. I love the music. I love the amber of the light. I'm just in love with the cars. I'm in love with all of it.": "Chris",

  "I have a Chevy Impala that I roll around in and a '89 Jeep Wrangler, which is the first car I ever bought. It has 180,000 miles on it, and that is my daily whip. I take that everywhere. Don't forget where you came from, that's why I'll never get rid of that Jeep.": "John",
  "White is actually one of my favorite colors. I have a white car. I love white.": "Kim",
  "Every system I have in my house or my car, they're all tuned exactly the same.": "Jimmy",
  "The relentless invisible storm of radio signals and electronic particles, the hustle and bustle, and the billions of petrol explosions in the engine blocks of trucks and cars seem to churn up the molecules of life and heaven so violently that the beautiful fogs are unable to hold together like they once did.": "Michael",
  "Would this country be better off if no one drank? Yes, it would be, but we tried that; it doesn't work. I don't want to tell anybody that they can't have as many drinks as they want every single night of the week as long as they don't get behind the wheel of a car.": "Gary",
  "If I go onstage, I want to give people everything they want and more. I'll wash their car for them on their way out.": "Trent",
  "Now that I have a thousand albums in my car all the time, I listen to more music. I was too lazy; I always had the same five discs in there. I'd never think to change it.": "Trent",
  "Back when Detroit was the head of auto manufacturing, it was clear where profits were created. Right? A car was made in Detroit. There was little argument that you could make that some of the money from that should be sent overseas to Ireland.": "Charles",
  "Even though it's hard to learn how to back your car out the driveway at first, once it becomes a habit, you can do it almost automatically and think about something else, like the meeting that you need to go to today or what's on the radio.": "Charles",

  "'Cars' is simply near and dear to my heart.": "John",
  "I'm a car nut. My father was a parts manager at a Chevrolet dealership.": "John",

  "'Cars' is a really personal story for me because, first of all, I grew up in Los Angeles - the car crazy capital.": "John",
  "Obviously, movies, you're often on location, out in the rain or the sun, in a real place where the trees and the cars are real. But when you're on stage, as an actor you're imagining the environment that you're in.": "Peter",
  "I never listen to the radio unless I rent a car.": "David",
  "There's a certain amount of freedom involved in cycling: you're self-propelled and decide exactly where to go. If you see something that catches your eye to the left, you can veer off there, which isn't so easy in a car, and you can't cover as much ground walking.": "David",
  "I'm not suggesting people abandon musical instruments and start playing their cars and apartments, but I do think the reign of music as a commodity made only by professionals might be winding down.": "David",
  "I don't listen to the radio very much, but that could be because I don't have a car.": "David",
  "I hope that if you are employed full-time, you are doing it to ensure that basic needs are met and not simply to indulge a taste for an elaborate home, fancy cars, and other luxuries.": "Gordon",
  "For value investors, General Motors is a tempting target. The company's share of the North American auto market has steadily declined for two decades, and analysts say the company suffers from weak management and unexciting cars.": "Alex",
  "I've got a role in the new Billy Bob Thornton movie that Billy Bob wrote and is going to direct called 'Jayne Mansfield's Car.' I only have four scenes, but I have as much dialogue as anybody in the movie.": "Ron",
  "You can get into a very fancy car and know everything about the engine, but when you drive in that car, you feel that rush. In the same way, I think the more you know about love, the more you can enjoy it. And knowing about your personality type, who you are and what kind of person you're dealing with gives you a great leg up.": "Helen",
  "A Rolex watch or an expensive car are the things guys often use to show status, wealth, and basic desirability.": "Helen",
  "I know some people who live this much more insulated life in Los Angeles, where their feet never touch public ground. They walk out of their bathroom, their living room, they get into their garage, their car, and the next thing you know, they're at the valet parking of the restaurant or the store or the office. They're in a bubble the whole time.": "Alec",
  "Everything I hated about L.A. I'm beginning to crave. L.A. is a place where you live behind a gate, you get in a car, your interaction with the public is minimal. I used to hate that.": "Alec",
  "Hollywood studios bury that stuff - actors who punch directors in the face and try to run producers over with cars - insanity, criminal behavior. But the studios are invested in that star, they can't have that person's name dirtied up.": "Alec",
  "I probably wouldn't be a good spokesman for an electric car, because I'll still get on a private jet, and one flight on a private jet undoes all my electric-car good deeds.": "George",
  "Who buys French cars? Not me.": "Karl",
  "When I got the job on 'Lost,' I was a broke university student living in the crappiest part of town, with a duct-taped back window on a broken-down car. I existed on peanut butter and tea.": "Evangeline",
  "My first-ever car, my parents bought me a red Fiat Uno. I was 17 and just so happy to have a car, so I was very fortunate that my parents were in a position to get me one - it was a secondhand car, but I was just so happy to have it.": "Victoria",
  "We need to stop flying, stop driving cars and jetting around on marine recreational vehicles.": "Paul",
  "Robots already perform many functions, from making cars to defusing bombs - or, more menacingly, firing missiles. Children and adults play with toy robots, while vacuum-cleaning robots are sucking up dirt in a growing number of homes and - as evidenced by YouTube videos - entertaining cats.": "Peter",
  "When I was writing 'Kitchen Confidential,' I was in my 40s, I had never paid rent on time, I was 10 years behind on my taxes, I had never owned my own furniture or a car.": "Anthony",
  "Honestly, the average American spends about 52 minutes a day in commute traffic. And as much as I love driving my car and many people like driving their car, commuting has never been fun for me.": "Sebastian",
  "Meat is a mighty contributor to climate change and other environmental problems. The amount of meat we're eating is one of the leading causes of climate change. It's as important as the kind of car you drive - whether you eat meat a lot or how much meat you eat.": "Michael",
  "I used to take my car and go down to the South Island for five or six days and climb glaciers and jump out of planes and jump off bridges and go white water rafting - a bit of thrill-seeking.": "Luke",
  "I'm as passionate as any car owner or car collector that has one car or 300 cars.": "Bill",
  "I've spent a lot of time in a rock n' roll band trying to fight off the fact that I was old enough to rent a car. And it's all sort of rushed in at once now. And I like it.": "Jason",
  "Two of my grandparents died in a car crash. Sucks, 'cause they would have lived to a hundred.": "Kid",
  "To this day, I am the least materialistic person I know, because my father didn't raise me to just go out and buy this or that car. The only reason I wanted to make money as an actor was because I'm passionate about food!": "Hugh",
  "I don't think Bond does too much; he's just suave and sexy. He rolls out with his martini and fancy cars. Wow, it sounds like my life already.": "Priyanka",
  "Humans are unbelievably data efficient. You don't have to drive 1 million miles to drive a car, but the way we teach a self-driving car is have it drive a million miles.": "Jeff",
  "In today's YouTube world, are officers reluctant to get out of their cars and do the work that controls violent crime? Are officers answering 911 calls but avoiding the informal contact that keeps bad guys from standing around, especially with guns?": "James",
  "I have a car in Nebraska. When I bought it, they gave me a satellite radio, and there's an 'indie-rock' station. It's just nothing I'm interested in.": "Conor",
  "Cars and cameras are the two things I let myself be materialistic about. I don't care about other stuff.": "Louis",
  "I'm someone who's always on the go and crazy busy, so I like to keep snacks in my car and at the office, and Cracker Jack'd is a really yummy snack that I love. I definitely am a big snacker.": "Ashley",
  "It just seemed too weird to me. I don't know, maybe they were smoking a joint in the car downstairs from their parents' apartment. I had to go that far to put together a scenario of how they could have possibly recognized me.": "Marc",
  "The parents of teenagers would love to have a car that won't go very far or go very fast. They could just cruise around the neighborhood, drive it to school, see their friends, plug it in overnight.": "Clayton",
  "People tend to cherish and take care of the things they pay for and therefore own, countries included. The opposite is also true. When was the last time you changed the oil in a rental car?": "Tucker",
  "A simple social engineering hack might involve leaving a thumb drive on the pavement close to the driver's door of a car.": "John",
  "In Japan, they have TV sets in cars right now, where you can punch up traffic routes, weather, everything! You can get Internet access already in cars in Japan, so within the next 2 to 3 years it's gonna be so crazy!": "Glenn",
  "Everybody has a gun in their car in Detroit.": "Jim",
  "Sometimes, I tell my wife I have to take a car trip and collect new memories - I like to drive around at absolute random for weeks on end through the United States and parts of Canada. Or else I feel trapped, like you feel when your life is completely planned for months in advance, and you think you're not getting enough oxygen.": "Jim",
  "American stuntmen are smart - they think about safety. When they do a jump in a car, they calculate everything: the speed, the distance... But in Hong Kong, we don't know how to count. Everything we do is a guess. If you've got the guts, you do it. All of my stuntmen have gotten hurt.": "Jackie",
  "If Uber is lower-priced, then more people will want it. And if more people want it and can afford it, then you have more cars on the road. And if you have more cars on the road, then your pickup times are lower, your reliability is better. The lower-cost product ends up being more luxurious than the high-end one.": "Travis",
  "If there was a mobility service that's cheaper than owning a car, more reliable, and you get to sit in the back seat instead of being stressed out in the front seat, why would you own a car?": "Travis",
  "I want a Mini-Cooper because it's fuel efficient, emissions efficient and all that stuff. It's small and better for the environment. I think that will be my next car.": "Christina",
  "My grandmother was probably the first person who I thought was beautiful. She was incredibly stylish, she had big hair, big cars. I was probably 3 years old, but she was like a cartoon character. She'd swoop into our lives with presents and boxes, and she always smelled great and looked great.": "Tom",
  "I went to Coachella once, and it was only to go see Leonard Cohen. I got in the car and sat through all the crazy traffic in L.A. to get there - instead of a two hour drive, it takes, like, six hours. Then I watched his set and turned around and left. I just so wanted to see him perform in the desert.": "Hannah",
  "We must be aware of consumerism! That's our tendency. It's the capitalistic curse that we were poisoned with. We should spend only what is necessary. How do you call the big cars, the latest ones? Hummer! Not a single dollar to import Hummers! What is that? What is that? What kind of revolution is this? One of Hummers? No way!": "Hugo",
  "How we fund transportation in this country is broken. You all pay a gasoline tax, right? Well, cars go farther, we get electric cars, and so on. And then we do more with the money than just build roads. We do bike lanes and mass transit.": "Kevin",
  "In the past there were people who were not rich but contented with their living style, laughing and happy all day. But when the new rich people appear, people look at them and ask, 'why don't I have a life like that too, a beautiful house, car and garden,' and they abandon their values.": "Thich",
  "I bought a lot of rubbish things that kids buy: skateboards and clothes and typical teenage stuff. And, as soon as I could, I wasted a lot of money on cars - BMW's mostly - for myself and my family.": "Tom",
  "I hate when someone drives my car and resets all the radio presets. I don't understand it. If I was ever driving someone's car, I would never touch the things that were set.": "Will",
  "It's worth noting that everything - from the Internet to electric cars, genomic sequencing, mobile apps, and social media - were pioneered by startups, not existing companies.": "Steve",
  "Maybe our best family trip started at Victoria Falls, which drenches you with spray and is so vast that it makes Niagara Falls seem like a backyard creek. Then we rented a car and made our way to Hwange National Park, which was empty of people but crowded with zebras, giraffes, elephants and more.": "Nicholas",
  "It's absurd that you know more about your car than you know about your body.": "Kevin",
  "Spending $1 for a brand new house would feel very, very good. Spending $1,000 for a ham sandwich would feel very, very bad. Spending $19,000 for a small family car would feel, well, more or less right. But as with physical pain, fiscal pain can depend on the individual, and everyone has a different threshold.": "Jeffrey",
  "If one wanted to find a modern symbol of personal freedom, the motor car is right there near the top of the list. But a car has come to mean much more than that. It has become a powerful statement about who you are and how much you earn.": "Martin",
  "Creative industries are more important than the car industry, luxury jewels, and fashion.": "Jean-Michel",
  "My boyfriend keeps telling me I've got to own things. So, first I bought this car. And then he told me I oughta get a house. 'Why a house?' 'Well, you gotta have a place to park the car.'": "Julia",
  "Everyone would have bigger and safer cars if they didn't have those CAFE standards: corporate average fuel economy.": "Grover",
  "VW has held a beloved place in American culture. When I graduated from college, many of my friends drove across the country, and most hit the road in a VW van or Bug. Through the years, these cars have represented youth, freedom and quirkiness.": "Frances",
  "The last thing I want to do is complain; I love what I do, and I know every job comes with a downside. But boy, this one's a doozy...You pull out of your driveway, and the paparazzi literally chase you, running red lights - I'm a really careful driver, especially with my kids in the car, but I worry they're going to cause an accident.": "Jennifer",
  "Just getting from the airport straight to the gym is gonna be your best bet to knock off that rust and wake yourself up and get that blood flowing. You sit in a car or a plane cramped up, you lose a lot of blood flow and get that swelling in your legs. There are all kinds of dangers in sitting still too long.": "Roman",
  "I drive a car, like an adult. Not brilliantly. I'm not great.": "Karl",
  "In 2010, I sold my car, a Toyota Majester, for just a lakh-and-a-half to be able to feed my horses. It continues to be like a hole, where I put all my money.": "Randeep",
  "I'm probably more dangerous in a car than I am on a motorbike; on a bike I'm very mindful of the fact that if you make a mistake, you're dead.": "James",
  "Auto racing is boring except when a car is going at least 172 miles per hour upside down.": "Dave",
  "I want a pit crew... I hate the procedure I currently have to go through when I have car problems.": "Dave",
  "Be able to back up a car for a considerable distance in a straight line and back out of a driveway.": "Marilyn",
  "One of the disadvantages of poetry over popular music is that if you write a pop song, it naturally gets into people's heads as they listen in the car. You don't have to memorize a Paul Simon song; it's just in your head, and you can sing along. With a poem, you have to will yourself to memorize it.": "Billy",
  "I was kidnapped by Sunni insurgents near Fallujah, in Iraq, ambushed by the Taliban in the Korengal Valley in Afghanistan, and injured in a car accident that killed my driver while covering the Taliban occupation of the Swat Valley in Pakistan.": "Lynsey",
  "Sometimes, when my wife and I were going out to dinner, I would take my laptop with me and work in the car, so as to take advantage of the half hour going and coming.": "Thomas",
  "What it is basically, if you go to a gun show, and there's somebody out there in the parking lot, and they're getting out of their car, and they've got an A-15 on their shoulder, or... John Q. Public wants to sell a handgun or whatever, then there's no background check.": "Phil",
  "I think many agree, being on the plan till 26, good idea; preexisting conditions, they all have a cost. So you have to find a way to pay for it. But it doesn't mean that you're going to keep or change. Listen, cars have tires. You can reinvent the car, but it's still going to have tires. Those aspects are components of healthcare.": "Rick",
  "When I was drafted by the Colts, Indianapolis was a basketball and a car racing town, but it didn't take long for the Colts to convert the city and state of Indiana into football evangelists.": "Peyton",
  "It's crazy that you have to tell your phone or your computer or your house or your car 'It's me!' hundreds of times a day. Wearables will solve that problem.": "Astro",
  "But I've never felt that being an actress is being in a comfortable place. It's seen from the outside that we're being driven in big cars and having these gorgeous suites and all of that. But come on, it's not about that.": "Juliette",
  "Boredom is a fearsome prospect. There's a limit to the number of cars and microwaves you can buy. What do you do then?": "J.",
  "There is a spiritual hunger in the world today - and it cannot be satisfied by better cars on longer credit terms.": "Adlai",
  "I rememeber one time we were getting ready to go to South America and everything was packed up and in the car ready to go and I hid and I was crying because I really did not want to go, I wanted to play. I did not want to go.": "Michael",
  "I always envied them, the owners of the cars with the white plates who can be seen around Jerusalem. I always wanted to be one of them. We call them U.N., even though U.N. are generally foreign correspondents with leased cars and yellow plates.": "Sayed",
  "I do love cars.": "Zlatan",
  "The car has become the carapace, the protective and aggressive shell, of urban and suburban man.": "Marshall",
  "Here comes 40. I'm feeling my age and I've ordered the Ferrari. I'm going to get the whole mid-life crisis package.": "Keanu",
  "I'm big on having a blistering pace. That's one of the hallmarks of what I do, and that's not easy. I never blow up cars and things like that, so it's something else that keeps the suspense flowing. I try not to write a chapter that isn't going to turn on the movie projector in your head.": "James",
  "Yeah, I left Idaho at 17. You know, I graduated high school a year early and just, you know, the typical story, packed up my car and moved out.": "Aaron",
  "I drive Fords, and I've driven American cars all my life, and I want to have a strong American manufacturing sector, especially in automobiles.": "Jim",
  "I collect vintage cars, so you always find them in my books.": "Clive",
  "I write songs for people who drive in cars. I really do.": "Melissa",
  "'The melancholy of all things done' is the way Buzz once described his complete mental breakdown after returning from the moon. Booze. A couple of divorces. A psych ward. Broke. At one point he was selling cars.": "Jeanne",
  "I don't know how to drive a car.": "Javier",
  "I've always been attracted to cars, and driving is a completely measurable experience: if you qualify last on the grid, you're the slowest, and if you qualify first on the grid, you're the fastest. So no one can say you're slow if you're fast and no one can say you're fast if you're slow.": "Eric",
  "I grew up in Texas, and people love their American-made muscle cars there. I grew up around people who loved cars and took care of cars and my dad's a big car nut, so I learned a little bit about cars - how to love them, most importantly. I think that from the time I could remember, I've always envisioned myself in a vintage muscle car.": "Amber",
  "The only thing I know is that no one ever sat in a therapist's or a psychiatrist's room saying, 'My parents just loved me too much.' The only thing you can do is love them and be around. Kids don't really care what your car is like or how big their house is. All they really care about is that you are around.": "James",
  "Most critics of gender division are women, and they're worried about girls and the roles presented for them by gendered entertainments. They are quite right to be. Telling girls that the cars and the guns are beyond their domain of expertise, and that they should content themselves with clothes and friendships, is limiting.": "Russell",
  "You want to make sure this particular car is going to please the customer and then you're going to be rewarded with something that is going to please the shareholder.": "Carlos",
  "The problem is Twitter is designing the metaphorical equivalent of a Toyota Prius. A car for the masses. While I want a Formula One race car.": "Robert",
  "If I can put on my album in a car or on my headphones and listen to the whole thing and love it, that's what I'm going to be happy putting out there.": "Ed",
  "When you think of bike couriers, you think of hyper speed. They get paid by how fast they can drop stuff off. The faster you go, the more chances you take. And the more chances you take, the greater the war between cyclists and cars.": "Dan",
  "I can't just wear whatever when I go out because somebody might want to take a picture. People are, like, taking pictures of me in my car when I'm driving. It's crazy. I kind of hate it sometimes.": "Bryson",
  "It turns out that if you optimize the performance of a car and of an airplane, they are very far away in terms of mechanical features. So you can make a flying car. But they are not very good planes, and they are not very good cars.": "Gregory",
  "I will sit in the car on the way to a meeting and just smile. I really mean that. It helps you get through life. If you have nothing to say, smile. Look up at the sky and smile. Just be grateful.": "Andre",
  "When it comes to cars, only two varieties of people are possible - cowards and fools.": "Russell",
  "Growing up in Southern California, it's all car culture. When I was a kid, I knew every single model of every single car dealer; I knew every style of every year.": "Cheech",
  "Every human being in this world is interested in certain things. Everybody has a hobby. Some people like art; I know nothing about it. Some people like books, some people like fishing, some people like music. I like to look at cars.": "Bikram",
  "Indian car buyers have not really been exposed to customer care in a competitive environment.": "Ratan",
  "People of great power wield great power, but people of lesser power or people who have fallen out of power go to jail without adequate evidence, or their bodies are found in the trunks of cars.": "Ratan"
