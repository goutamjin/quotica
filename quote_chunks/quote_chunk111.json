  "Since I got involved in Telco, we first developed the first modular truck, the 407, then the 709, and now the 2213. These trucks broke away from the old face of Telco trucks. I was also just as much involved with the Safari, but nobody talks about the Safari. My involvement has been there with all Telco's projects -somehow the car has got hyped up.": "Ratan",
  "In syndication, the biggest buyers are car dealerships.": "Bill",
  "I don't listen to the radio in the car, and I do that because I don't want to be influenced.": "Tom",
  "Chrysler builds great cars.": "Lee",
  "I grew up in a culture of motorbikes. So I like racing just fine. Quite a lot, actually. That was when I was a boy in Australia. And I never really made the jump to cars after that.": "Chris",
  "It's like driving your car. If you drive too fast on the highway, you will topple, so you better maintain your speed. Life is similar to that, and that's the way you have to control your head.": "A.",
  "When I was a kid, nobody in my family had a car. And I didn't have many toys. The only toys I had were the ones I would steal.": "DMX",
  "The reason we have cancer and heart disease is the same reason you can't get rid of the wear and tear on your tires on your car: as soon as you use them, you are wearing them away. You can't make eternal tires, and it's the same with the human body.": "S.",
  "Whenever I made money I invested in myself... I bought whatever I needed to make my career better. I never really spent money on other stuff, like buying expensive cars.": "Tiesto",
  "I had more clothes than I had closets, more cars than garage space, but no money.": "Sammy",
  "Building a house from scratch in the middle of a field is a bit like building a prototype car. As with all prototypes, if you're building a car you usually have the luxury of producing several prototypes before you arrive at the production line version - so the opportunity for changing things is quite rich.": "Kevin",
  "My definition of a redundancy is an air-bag in a politician's car.": "Larry",
  "Television is such an evolving medium. When you're doing a TV show, it's not like you just shoot for six weeks and you're in an editing room with all of your footage. It's like a guitar or a car, you have to fine tune things. You stop doing what's not working, you work on what is working and you add things that do work.": "Chris",
  "Cities offer us powerful leverage on our most stubborn, wasteful practices. Long commutes in our cars, big power bills from our energy-hogging buildings, shopping trips to buy stuff that'll spend a few short months in our homes and long centuries in our landfills.": "Alex",
  "Every snapshot collector has obsessions. Some only collect photos of cars. Others like World War II, or babies, or old-timey girls in old-timey swimsuits. I happen to collect the weird stuff: photos that make the hair on the back of your neck stand up a little. The uncanny.": "Ransom",
  "This generation is so dead. You ask a kid, 'What are you doing this Saturday?' and they'll be playing video games or watching cable, instead of building model cars or airplanes or doing something creative. Kids today never say, 'Man, I'm really into remote-controlled steamboats.'": "Jack",
  "We need to bring Android and Chrome to every screen that matters for users, which is why we focused on phone, wearables, car, television, laptops, and even your workplace.": "Sundar",
  "Failures are much more dramatic than successes, and people like drama. I think this is why automobile races draw such crowds. People expect spectacular crashes, which we tend to find more interesting than cars just racing around the track. The same is true of bridges, buildings, or any structure or machine.": "Henry",
  "I've made club songs, and I've made radio songs, and I've made the car songs.": "T-Pain",
  "I do YouTube my cars a lot.": "T-Pain",
  "I could never drive in a great big car; people like me because I'm a man of the people, a hustler.": "Terry",
  "Yeah, I'm the Brit who isn't Lewis Hamilton that woke up and realised he was good. I got that tag because I was young, flying around in jets and driving fast cars. I always took my driving seriously, but I suppose I enjoyed life... But I'm not a playboy.": "Jenson",
  "I keep my weight low, although you need to be able to move your weight around the race car to change the balance. I'm 6ft and I'm 70kg so I haven't much fat on me.": "Jenson",
  "I always check my harness before I do a stunt I test-drive the cars I have to race or explode I'm present at all pyrotechnical rehearsals and I walk through everything step-by-step. No man should put their life in someone else's hands unless they have covered their own safety from all angles. ": "Akshay",
  "We approach people the same way we approach our cars. We take the poor kid to a doctor and ask, What's wrong with him, how much will it cost, and when can I pick him up?": "James",
  "Being poor with three small children is terrifying. You can't make any plans. You know you're not going on holiday, ever. There's no way you could ever afford driving lessons or a car. And the guilt I used to feel: they had holes in their shoes, and at one point, I had to send them to school wearing Wellingtons when the sun was shining.": "Sue",
  "There's something scary, knowing that in Florida, someone can pick you up in a car and drive you to 50 states. Back home, it's like, 'Girl, you're 15 minutes away.'": "Grace",
  "Well, you can say there is a self driving car. I'm seeing the automation of vehicles. Really, computer-assisted driving. I think that is really interesting to us because we are taking all of the sensors technologies and putting them in cars and making people safer.": "Tony",
  "I take a lot of pride in the work I do, because people pay to see me. They've got to get babysitters, park their car, get popcorn and candy. I've got to be conscious of that.": "Mr.",
  "If I weren't skateboarding, I'd love to race cars. I like anything that's fast and active.": "Ryan",
  "I love driving. I still drive a 1993 Toyota Camry. I do want to get an electric car, but it's less of a carbon footprint if you keep your old, fuel-efficient car on the road than if you say 'build me a whole new car.'": "Josh",
  "The car industry has invested a lot in hybrid, but my opinion is electric cars will take over a lot of hybrids quicker than people think now.": "Henrik",
  "I really like driving cars. I love car games.": "Kodi",
  "I'm an anorak. I've always been an obsessive collector of things. Richard Briers collects stamps. I collect cars and guns, which are much more expensive, and much more difficult to store.": "Michael",
  "I remember reading 'The Hobbit' on a car trip from Ohio to Mississippi and getting out at a rest-stop in Mississippi and feeling jet-lagged at my return from Middle-earth.": "Garth",
  "Either the car is stationary, or it's on the move.": "Murray",
  "Removing the faults in a stage-coach may produce a perfect stage-coach, but it is unlikely to produce the first motor car.": "Edward",
  "When I went to the University of California, Santa Barbara, in 2002, I decided I wanted to leave my car at home and create an experiment with my own life. I'd only be able to find creative solutions to transportation if I felt the pain of trying to get to downtown at 10 o'clock at night.": "Logan",
  "Those who have come into Formula One without experiencing cars devoid of electronic aids will find it tough. To control 800 horse power relying just on arm muscles and foot sensitivity can turn out to be a dangerous exercise.": "Michael",
  "People get excited around me and behave differently than they would normally. I don't feel different from anyone else, except that I drive a racing car round in circles faster than somebody else.": "Michael",
  "Nothing impresses the ladies like a clean, pressed pair of khakis and a large pattern shirt featuring either classic cars, mojitos or men playing golf.": "Tim",
  "To this day, I still haven't touched one dime of my signing bonus or NFL contract money. I live off my marketing money and haven't blown it on any big-money expensive cars, expensive jewelry, or tattoos and still wear my favorite pair of jeans from high school.": "Rob",
  "I drank a lot when I was a teenager and I don't drink any more, because that's when I thought, you know, I'm gonna end up a car wreck.": "Kristin",
  "People get very thoughtful when they are in cars. I no longer care for cars. I don't collect them.": "Mick",
  "I like structure - like driving: go past the school on the street, stay on the right side, no hitting the car, go in right, you'll see a big church, stop and take a left, and you'll have it. By doing this I'm giving a structure of life, a path of light, and showing what happens between me and me, which is something very beautiful.": "Jean-Claude",
  "If all the cars in the United States were placed end to end, it would probably be Labor Day Weekend.": "Doug",
  "Qualifying is all about putting everything that you have and that the car has in one lap. It's like a rush, I really enjoy that.": "Sebastian",
  "We always kept believing in ourselves and our team and the car.": "Sebastian",
  "When I leave the car park at Melwood, I try and become a completely different person. I try to get away from it. You have got to. Otherwise you end up like Jamie Carragher - obsessed!": "Steven",
  "I've worked as a labourer, driven taxis and school buses, and been a car mechanic - whatever I could do just to get by. But it does mean that I know a little bit about a lot of things.": "Cory",
  "But I have a driver, so I can return calls while I'm in the car.": "Donna",
  "I wanted to send a message to the television industry that excitement is not made of car chases.": "Gene",
  "My grandfather milked several cows twice a day and supplied the neighbours with dairy products. He liked to go visiting around the county on Saturdays, and he also enjoyed the neighbours when they came by once a week with their empty milk jars. He walked them out to their cars and hung over the driver's side window until they drove off.": "Kary",
  "We take better care of the maintenance of our cars than we take care of the maintenance of our bodies.": "David",
  "The reason I keep talking about a wife and saying the word 'wife' on stage is because it seems a funny word to me. The more you say it, the more it seems to detach from that person and become this sort of abstract thing: that you would set out to find a wife, that it would be an objective like buying a new car.": "Stephen",
  "Whirlyball is only the most awesome sport on the planet! It's like bumper cars plus lacrosse meets basketball.": "St.",
  "When I go to Indian reservations in the West, and especially to the Pine Ridge Reservation, I sometimes feel unsure where to put my foot when I open the car door. The very ground is different from where I usually stand. There are fewer curbs, fewer sidewalks, and almost no street signs, mailboxes, or leashed dogs.": "Ian",
  "The hybrid engine costs a lot of money, and customers are hardly willing to spend so much more for a car.": "Martin",
  "In Copenhagen, we all ride bicycles everywhere, partly because it is impossible to park a car, but also because you can cross the city in 20 minutes on a bike.": "Birgitte",
  "John D. Rockefeller wanted to dominate oil, but Microsoft wants it all, you name it: cable, media, banking, car dealerships.": "Ralph",
  "I love everything from old-school cars to whatever the latest muscle or luxury vehicles are.": "Ludacris",
  "When I was four, I just wanted to drive, I collected toy cars. Where does that sort of thing come from? In hindsight you go, 'Oh, liked it because of this.' Maybe it's just the wheel.": "Michael",
  "I think women like Ferraris. A Ferrari is everybody's car.": "Tim",
  "So I was getting into my car, and this bloke says to me 'Can you give me a lift?' I said 'Sure, you look great, the world's your oyster, go for it.'": "Tim",
  "Growing up in the Sacramento Valley in the '70s, we were all pretty big into cars. Of course, I had to nerd out and be a fan of Bob Tullius' Group 44 Jaguars instead of Corvettes/Camaros.": "Gabe",
  "My dad worked for different companies that made whiskey for a long time, so we were definitely whiskey drinkers. Growing up, my friends would get toy cars, and I would get swag from whisky companies.": "Mike",
  "I'm enjoying the money, the big house, the cars; what ghetto kid wouldn't?": "O.",
  "Richard Childress and myself have made some important innovations on our cars.": "Dale",
  "I think all males from Detroit have an obsession with cars.": "Dax",
  "I would never kill a living thing, although I probably have inadvertently while driving automobiles.": "Captain",
  "People spend so much time in their cars, and it's a legal way to have fun by speeding a little bit or testing yourself a little bit, and you get to invest in your car. For some people, it becomes their baby.": "Jordana",
  "Corn ethanol can help in the short term, but it has serious limitations, and none of this is going to work if we don't dramatically improve the efficiency of our cars and trucks.": "David",
  "If you look at landscape in historical terms, you realize that most of the time we have been on Earth as a species, what has fallen on our retina is landscape, not images of buildings and cars and street lights.": "Bill",
  "Sometimes the challenge of beating the jet lag and getting a decent sleep can be as hard to solve as finding the right setup for the car!": "Romain",
  "I arrived in California with no job, no car, and no money, but, like millions of other girls, a dream.": "Victoria",
  "As a driver, you want to race every lap possible, especially when you've got a good car.": "Romain",
  "A car is thirty thousand parts you're putting together.": "Mary",
  "I saw an ad for an expensive car and got so excited about it, I called the dealer. 'How are those new cars?' I asked. 'They're fine,' he said. I thought he'd offer to let me drive it for a weekend. He didn't. I expected a salesman to call. No one did. I didn't buy the car.": "Stanley",
  "A suburban mother's role is to deliver children obstetrically once, and by car forever after.": "Peter",
  "I think we have to act like stars because it is expected of us. So we drive our big cars and live in our smart houses.": "Maurice",
  "I'm a racer at heart more than anything else, and that will always be my priority: competing. But ultimately, if you can't drive, you can still have the competitive spirit outside of a car.": "Jacques",
  "People can't stay out of their cars. I do think we have a real problem staying out of our automobiles. We have a real dependency on them, and it may be for more than just transportation.": "Steve",
  "I have a pickup truck. And I prefer to be with dogs or on my sailboat than in a car - actually, more than any other place on Earth.": "Gary",
  "Adults are locked into car payments and divorces and work. They haven't got time to think fresh.": "Gary",
  "The goal of mass transit is to convince people to abandon their cars, which feature such enticing accessories as CD players and elbow room.": "Brendan",
  "I like the guy who reads. Being articulate is something that's very important to me. But you need to know how to chop wood and fix a car and do guy things. I didn't grow up with spectators. Nobody was a spectator.": "Hilarie",
  "The alarm rings 4:45, again at 5, but I wake up 4:30 naturally. Shower, shave, orange juice, perk my own coffee, hear the news, and the CBS car arrives 5:30.": "Charlie",
  "You have to wait six months to purchase a fuel efficient automobile made from overseas.": "Ed",
  "I've got more stuff asked of me every week. But I drive a race car for a living. My car owner lets me race as many sprint car races as I want to run.": "Tony",
  "I wish people would spend their money on hybrid cars.": "Ryan",
  "A Fiat Panda, it's the best car in the world.": "Luca",
  "Once the subject matter of rock n' roll changed from cars and pop love songs to songs about really true love and the blues and death and mortality, this light bulb went off in my head and I went, 'Oh, that's what they're doing. That's kind of - that's art.'": "David",
  "(On seeing a former lover for the first time in years) I thought I told you to wait in the car.": "Tallulah",
  "I just feel rejuvenated in such a big way because of these race cars I get to drive.": "Jeff",
  "So much of my life is spent just focused on driving race cars.": "Jeff",
  "My approach is to start from the straightforward principle that our body is a machine. A very complicated machine, but none the less a machine, and it can be subjected to maintenance and repair in the same way as a simple machine, like a car.": "Aubrey",
  "Older cars tend to drive like older cars. That is not for me.": "Robert",
  "On my job I end up jumping out of planes. Last week I got in an 18-wheeler and drove down a runway onto a skid track. The week before that they put me in a car and sunk me to the bottom of a lake to see if I could escape without an oxygen tank.": "Rick",
  "But to personally satisfy my own adrenalin needs, I've been racing cars a little bit, which has been fun.": "Picabo",
  "Every city has to deal with the problem of cars and public transport.": "Jaime",
  "I really want to drive a Porsche GT1 car - also a McLaren, if I could fit. I want to do LeMans badly. I want to do Spa, a European series with World SportsCars.": "Craig",
  "I don't buy diamonds, I don't buy cars, but I enjoy travelling. I'm not a very possessive person as far as things go.": "Frank",
  "I had a lot of fun driving race cars, but it wasn't my No. 1 priority.": "Carroll",
  "Cars did not kill off horses. Digital publishing will not kill off books.": "Michael",
  "See, what you're meant to do when you have a mid-life crisis is buy a fast car, aren't you? Well, I've always had fast cars. It's not that. It's the fear that you're past your best. It's the fear that the stuff you've done in the past is your best work.": "Robbie",
  "I love driving cars, looking at them, cleaning and washing and shining them. I clean 'em inside and outside. I'm very touchy about cars. I don't want anybody leaning on them or closing the door too hard, know what I mean?": "Scott",
  "Even when they're not causing injury, human-controlled cars are often driven inefficiently, ineptly, antisocially, or in other ways additive to the sum of human misery.": "Tom",
  "I recorded a song called, I Fall to Pieces, and I was in a car wreck. Now I'm worried because I have a brand-new record, and it's called Crazy!": "Patsy",
  "Boys, they can't take my refrigerator now. They'll never get my car now. I paid cash for 'em and they're mine, and I'm keepin' 'em!": "Patsy",
  "No action hero is more closely associated with cars than James Bond.": "Richard",
  "You need someone to tell you how to do things like hitting your marks, or driving a car so it looks right or getting out of a car so it doesn't take a million years of screen time.": "Gary",
  "I jumped 18 cars on a motorcycle, so I did almost everything.": "David",
  "I once came back from a book tour where sleek black cars driven by nice men in black suits waited for me at every hotel, took me to every signing, brought me back, opened car doors for me. They were great. I was great. It was a wonderful tour.": "MaryJanice",
  "The first time I rode a bike I was four or five. I crashed into the back of a car.": "David",
  "In the history of the world, no one has ever washed a rented car.": "Lawrence",
  "When I came out of high school, my objective in life was to get a job selling used cars, but after trying for two weeks, nobody would hire me.": "Jim",
  "But my passion is racing cars. It's what I like to do in my off time.": "Mark-Paul",
  "Horses and mules, and even sail cars, made more rapid progress than did the earliest locomotive.": "John",
  "Some people say it might be good for your career to die and then come back again. I have died many ways, car crashes, motorcycle crashes, etc. But, I am still alive.": "Mark-Paul",
  "I always keep a ball in the car. You never know.": "Hakeem",
  "Buyers of powerful cars place a high premium on the exhaust note, and manufacturers spend a lot of money getting it right. At the same time, high-end cars are expected to filter out the sounds of the mundane world.": "Serge",
  "When I lived in Baltimore, I would come down fairly often to go to the Hirshhorn, and one of my good friends from high school went to Georgetown. I actually ended up going to Annapolis a lot. I had a car, and it was such a serene place to drive.": "Abbi",
  "When I first drove my car down Sunset Strip, I nearly crashed my car gazing at the monolithic ads of various celebrities. They are bigger than King Kong, and more frightening.": "Rebecca",
  "Go to the depot here, now, and what will you see? A well-dressed colored lady, with her little children by her side, whom she has brought up intelligently and with refinement, as much so as white children, comes to the cars, and where is she shown to? Into the smoking car, where men are cursing, swearing, spitting on the floor.": "Hiram",
  "I have about 40 cars, of which 25 to 30 are what you might call serious.": "Nick",
  "There's this classic car crash thing about 'Macbeth.' You can just see this car driving at 100 mph towards this brick wall, and you can't do anything about it, and the characters are desperately trying to stop it and can't.": "Justin",
  "What I've seen around the world is if the regulatory desires are combined with things that affect consumer behavior - such as in Europe, they tax gasoline very heavily - you do get people to move to very fuel efficient cars; trade off bigger vs. smaller cars.": "Rick",
  "That was my pride and joy - that I made it through all those years of minor hockey without losing any of my teeth; then, I ended up losing them in a car accident in New York when I was riding in a taxi. So, I end up losing my teeth, but not in the glamorous fashion I envisioned.": "Tom",
  "I got my heel stuck in a drain as I was crossing the street and cars were coming. It was really scary. A girl in heels in New York is a hard combination.": "Sasha",
  "Societies need rules that make no sense for individuals. For example, it makes no difference whether a single car drives on the left or on the right. But it makes all the difference when there are many cars!": "Marvin",
  "It's like watching a car accident, that reality TV.": "Enrico",
  "In Toronto, I grew up taking a subway, I grew up taking a bus. I spent my formative adult years in New York City, walking the streets, taking the subway. You're connected to the larger whole. L.A. is so spread out, and you're so incubated inside those cars and it's so exhausting to deal with the traffic, without really having the human contact.": "Enrico",
  "The key is to join an industry that you have a passion for. If you love cars, then automotive is where you should end up.": "Gwynne",
  "The top golfers in the world are like Formula One cars when it comes to their swings.": "Stuart",
  "It's such a stress always trying to get bigger houses and larger cars and better schools. Of course, parents want to give their children the best opportunities in life, but sometimes that can stifle them.": "Shirley",
  "Before I had satellite radio installed in my car, I thought I would lose my mind listening to commercials and having limited choices on the dial. Your car is your home in L.A., so you've got to have some good stuff to listen to.": "Amy",
  "The amount of energy saved by switching off the phone charger is exactly the same as the energy used by driving an average car for one second.": "David",
  "We still see that people don't really realize that electric cars are here right now. And when we show up with an actual vehicle, and you see it drive away under its own power, it's still kind of a jaw-dropping moment for a lot of people.": "Franz",
  "I've got two old Volvos, two old Subarus, and an old Ford Ranger. If you've got an old car, you've gotta have at least several old cars, 'cause one's always gonna be in the garage.": "Rip",
  "When you live in a safe place like Monte Carlo, you can walk home at any time of the night and you don't have to worry. I don't feel at risk there. If I drive myself, I can leave the car doors unlocked.": "Shirley",
  "For Nirvana, putting out their first major-label record was like getting into a new car. But the runaway success was like suddenly discovering that the car was a Ferrari and the accelerator pedal was Krazy Glued to the floorboard.": "Michael",
  "My sporting hero was Drazen Petrovic, the NBA basketball player, who was killed in a car accident in 1993. He was a good friend, an unbelievable player, and I dedicated my Wimbledon win to him.": "Goran",
  "You talk about German technocracy and you get automobiles.": "Gordon",
  "I drove 3,500 miles this summer on our family holiday, we drove across 10 countries. I have driven across the United States four times. I love cars, I love being in cars, I think so do most people. I want to help and support those people who have that same kind of enthusiasm for driving that I have.": "Geoff",
  "The format of the race weekend is also very well thought out. We have enough practice time to get the cars well set-up and have a proper qualifying session where we can do as many laps as we like, which is great for the drivers and spectators.": "Nigel",
  "Of course we want to pocket Fisker. But we will bid rationally. Whatever the result, nothing can stop us from making electric cars.": "Lu",
  "The American dream, what we were taught was, grow up, own a car, own a house. I think that dream's completely changing. We were taught to keep up with the Joneses. Now we're sharing with the Joneses.": "Brian",
  "I have two bikes: a classic 1978 Yamaha SR500 and a more modern Suzuki SV650. I've been into cars and bikes since I was tiny.": "Thomas",
  "I realize at one point, that I was being followed, and then I began to see the surveillance that was going past the road on my house. And so, these cars began to surveil me. People began to follow me around, and it did, it was very disrupting to think that your privacy was being violated, and for no reason that I could come up with.": "Gloria",
  "The years I raced in were fantastic. There was so much change in the cars. We went from treaded tyres to no wings right through to slicks to enormous wings.": "Jackie",
  "We often attribute 'understanding' and other cognitive predicates by metaphor and analogy to cars, adding machines, and other artifacts, but nothing is proved by such attributions.": "John",
  "Germans make nice cars.": "Jason",
  "If any demonstrator ever lays down in front of my car, it'll be the last car he'll ever lay down in front of.": "George",
  "I am training at such a high level that I actually could eat anything and get by. But as my coach always says, your body is like a car, and food is like your fuel. I am a race car, so I can't just put unleaded fuel in my car. I need that good premium fuel.": "Lolo",
  "No illusion is more crucial than the illusion that great success and huge money buy you immunity from the common ills of mankind, such as cars that won't start.": "Larry",
  "Getting ready to wrestle is like getting ready for a car crash. Getting ready to work with Brock Lesnar is like knowing you're going to get hit by a bus and the bus is going to back over you. If I'm going to work 'WrestleMania,' 16 weeks out I have to start training like I'm Mayweather getting ready for a fight.": "Triple",
  "To have some idea what it's like, stand in the outside lane of a motorway, get your mate to drive his car at you at 95 mph and wait until he's 12 yards away, before you decide which way to jump.": "Geoffrey",
  "Drive-in banks were established so most of the cars today could see their real owners.": "E.",
  "I don't buy fur coats or jewelry. I have old cars.": "Peta",
  "I've always had an inquisitive mind about everything from flowers to television sets to motor cars. Always pulled them apart - couldn't put 'em back, but always extremely interested in how things work.": "Craig",
  "We aren't addicted to oil, but our cars are.": "James",
  "Well, I always had a chauffer, because I have never driven a car in my life. I still can't drive.": "Bud",
  "Stone Mountain, Georgia, still had Ku Klux Klan marches, and I had a wild and courageous mother who'd put us in the car to watch them. She wanted us to know those things existed.": "Nicole",
  "The driver of a racing car is a component. When I first began, I used to grip the steering wheel firmly, and I changed gear so hard that I damaged my hand.": "Juan",
  "It's strange that we create tech and then we apply it to machines, when we could apply it to ourselves. Cars can now detect if something is behind them, but we don't have this ability. Why are we applying such a simple sense to a car when we could apply it to ourselves?": "Neil",
  "Yeah, I like cars and basketball. But you know what I like more? Bananas.": "Frankie",
  "My most memorable recognition story was in Venice, Italy. My fiance and I were renting a car, and I was recognized by the person standing behind me by my voice. I thought that was hysterical!": "Erica",
  "A car for every purse and purpose.": "Alfred",
  "I have a need to make these sorts of connections literal sometimes, and a vehicle often helps to do that. I have a relationship to car culture. It isn't really about loving cars. It's sort of about needing them.": "Matthew",
  "Running on different types of racetracks is challenging - not only for the drivers, but even more for the team members who have to make adjustments to the cars before each race.": "Michael",
  "I don't need jewels and cars. It's about the delicacy of the way I'm handled.": "Leonor",
  "Making a new car is so expensive that the risk factor is what takes the unique ideas and keeps reanalyzing them until they become very similar.": "Charles",
  "The old 7 Series, the E38, was an elegant car, an evolution of the classic BMW look. But it wasn't penetrating the luxury market as we desired. It just didn't have the presence to be noticed.": "Chris",
  "Why did they keep changing guitars and amplifiers when they were perfect? They did the same things with cars, if you ask me. They forgot how to make them right, because they focused on style and bells and whistles.": "Buddy",
  "I did a lot of musical theater when I was younger, and I really hope to get back there someday. I miss singing a lot. I listen to Broadway show tunes in my car and sing along to them.": "Bridget",
  "It's super important that people use their significant buying power to pull companies like Ferrari and show them there is a market for sustainable fuel. So many other car companies would take notice if Ferrari made headway on this measure.": "Petter",
  "Not having to own a car has made me realize what a waste of time the automobile is.": "Diane",
  "I think it's particularly a distinctively American concept that resonates with American culture through biker culture. A motorcycle is an independent thing.

  "Kanye is so much fun. He's a wonderful person. What I love about Kim and Kanye is that I think they save their happy moments and their smiles for themselves rather than sharing everything with the public. And listen, when a camera is shoved in your face trying to take a selfie, you do not want to smile.": "Chrissy",
  "As a model, I really stand for not being a model, if that makes sense. When I started, the whole idea of the model was very different; it was a bit stuck-up. Not stuck-up, but no one was trying to have fun, or not even have fun, but be willing to smile.": "Cara",

  "I was walking around legally blind. Now I have 20-20 vision. I can't believe I spent so many years blurry, but I think that coincides with how I was feeling. Now I notice if people are watching me, but I also smile right back if someone waves, which helps.": "Nicole",

  "The 'good' mother, with her fixed smile, her rigidity, her goody-goody outlook, her obsession with unnecessary hygiene, is in fact a fool. It is the 'bad' mother, unafraid of a joke and a glass of wine, richly self-expressive, scornful of suburban values, who is, in reality, good.": "Rachel",

  "My mother-in-law speaks not a word of English. I speak not a word of Tajiki. So I smile at her ingratiatingly and she fixes me with a beady eye.": "Wilbur",

I am very much a daddy's girl, and even though I would rather my smile wasn't crooked, there is something moving for me about having a mouth exactly like my father's.": "Chimamanda",
  "It is clear I was never the Pretty Girl. I had my two front teeth knocked out when I was 10 and didn't fix them until I was 19.

  "Whenever I look at a baby or children in general, I smile and just want to play with them.": "Odeya",
  "I play guys who never smile, and I never stop smiling.": "Michael",
  "My mom's one of the toughest ladies I know. I've seen her lose both her brothers, both her parents. She's been through a lot, and to see her get up every day and put a smile on her face, that shows nothing but strength.": "DeMar",
  "No one is so completely disenchanted with the world, or knows it so thoroughly, or is so utterly disgusted with it, that when it begins to smile upon him he does not become partially reconciled to it.": "Giacomo",

  "From a very young age, music was very much in my house. I would sit with my mom, with the old LPs, listening to The Beatles and Carly Simon and Lionel Richie. The old LPs used to have the lyrics. From there, I would put on dance and music displays for my family, just to entertain them and make people laugh and smile.": "Lara",
  "When I used to wrestle professionally, I preferred being the bad guy known as 'The Heel;' you would get to 'work the crowd,' getting them to hate you and want to see you lose, while the good guy 'Babyface' would walk in, smile and shake hands with a few kids, and his acting job was done.": "Conan",
  "I spend days on my Xperia logging on Facebook chatting with my friends and family at home; I love listening to Rihanna and Pink and watching movies. Basically, anything that makes me smile, but most of my fans will know that I am always smiling!": "Dominika",

  "I don't hear a lot about elected officials that are men talking about whether they smile a lot. My dad was in elected office my entire life. I don't remember many smiles, and nobody commented about it. He was serious about his job, and so am I.": "Stephanie",
  "After God and my family, it's surf. I don't imagine me not surfing. Surf brings me smile every day.": "Gabriel",
  "I grew up in a household without a TV. We lived next door to a library for a while, and at one point, I checked out all the books in the fairy tale section. I remember the librarian's quiet smile as I'd bring back one stack and exchange it for another.": "Victoria",
  "Tell me not of joy: there's none Now my little sparrow's gone; He, just as you, Would toy and woo, He would chirp and flatter me, He would hang the wing awhile, Till at length he saw me smile, Lord! how sullen he would be!": "William",
  "You keep shooting. You hope it goes in, and you smile.": "Teemu",
  "We're under some gross misconception that we're a good species, going somewhere important, and that at the last minute we'll correct our errors and God will smile on us. It's delusion.": "Farley",

  "How far away the stars seem, and how far is our first kiss, and ah, how old my heart.": "William",
  "Today I begin to understand what love must be, if it exists... When we are parted, we each feel the lack of the other half of ourselves. We are incomplete like a book in two volumes of which the first has been lost. That is what I imagine love to be: incompleteness in absence.": "Edmond",

  "A realist, in Venice, would become a romantic by mere faithfulness to what he saw before him.": "Arthur",

  "Romance is tempestuous. Love is calm.": "Mason",
  "When I give I give myself.": "Walt",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic and I believe that you can find love in many different places and be very conflicted. I've discovered as I've grown up that life is far more complicated than you think it is when you're a kid. It isn't just a straightforward fairytale.": "Rachel",

  "You feel very romantic when you're in a ball gown. Everyone should wear one once in a while.": "Carolina",
  "When I was a kid, I knew the black and white version of 'Jane Eyre,' and I guess I became interested in the idea of romantic love - of unrequited love and the tragedies of that; of what are the important things in life; what should one value over other materials.": "Cary",
  "The most impactful place that I've been to where I was just completely awestruck, happy, moved is Victoria Falls between Zambia and Zimbabwe. It is probably the most beautiful and romantic place in the world.": "Hill",

  "I am a hopeless romantic. And I won't stop till I get it right.": "Halle",
  "It is really rare to find someone you really, really love and that you want to spend your life with and all that stuff that goes along with being married. I am one of those lucky people.

  "I love the ukulele. It's got a beautiful, melodic tone to it. There's something innocent and romantic, and it's just a grand instrument to play.": "Pierce",
  "I joined the air force. I took to it immediately when I arrived there. I did three years, eight months, and ten days in all, but it took me a year and a half to get disabused of my romantic notions about it.": "Morgan",
  "I'm not religious, I'm not romantic and I live purely by logic. I make every decision by logic and sometimes that leads me to the right and sometimes to the wrong decision.": "Laura",
  "I'm a teller of stories. I put bloody skins on my back and dance around the fire, and I say what the hunt was like. It's not erudite; it's not intellectual. I sail, run dogs, ride horses, play professional poker, and tell stories about the stuff I've been through. And I'm still a romantic; I still want Bambi to make it out of the fire.": "Gary",
  "And I don't believe that children are innocent. In fact, no one seriously believes that. Just go to a playground and watch the kids playing in the sandbox! The romantic notion of the sweet child is simply the parents projecting their own wishes.": "Michael",
  "Romantic love can be terrifying. We experience another human being as enormously important to us. So there is surrender - not a surrender to the other person so much as to our feeling for the other person. What is the obstacle? The possibility of loss.": "Nathaniel",
  "French is the language that turns dirt into romance.": "Stephen",
  "I think I meant that, given the circumstances of my childhood, I had the illusion that it's easier to be alone. To have your relationships be casual and also to pose as a solitary person, because it was more romantic. You know, I was raised on the idea of the ramblin' man and the loner.": "Steve",
  "Romantic love is painful.": "will.i.am",
  "Love to me has meant different things at different junctures of my life. I'm not a hopeless romantic.": "Randeep",
  "I've always said that inside of me there is a rocker that wants to come out, but I'm a romantic rocker.": "Luis",
  "What I'd really like to write is a romantic comedy. This is my favorite kind of movie. I feel almost embarrassed revealing this, because the genre has been so degraded in the past twenty years that saying you like romantic comedies is essentially an admission of mild stupidity.": "Mindy",
  "I do not like to work with patients who are in love. Perhaps it is because of envy - I, too, crave enchantment. Perhaps it is because love and psychotherapy are fundamentally incompatible. The good therapist fights darkness and seeks illumination, while romantic love is sustained by mystery and crumbles upon inspection.": "Irvin",
  "I am a romantic fool, no doubt about that.": "Alex",
  "A boy is holding a girl so very tight in his arms tonight.": "Edward",
  "Romantic love is mental illness. But it's a pleasurable one. It's a drug. It distorts reality, and that's the point of it. It would be impossible to fall in love with someone that you really saw.": "Fran",

  "I'm a romantic, and we romantics are more sensitive to the way people feel. We love more, and we hurt more. When we're hurt, we hurt for a long time.": "Freddy",
  "Is this not the true romantic feeling; not to desire to escape life, but to prevent life from escaping you.": "Thomas",
  "I think I'll always be a hopeless romantic.": "Kim",
  "I love to have my hair down I love to have my hair full... there's something romantic about it. ": "Blake",

  "Satan, really, is the romantic youth of Jesus re-appearing for a moment.": "James",

  "The idea of a soulmate is beautiful and very romantic to talk about it in a movie or a song, but in reality, I find it scary.": "Vanessa",
  "If you're a woman and a guy's ever said anything romantic to you, he just left off the second part that would have made you sick if you could have heard it.": "Louis",
  "I am a hopeless romantic.": "Jessica",
  "Romantic music really stirs my soul. And, of course, I love Chinese music; it makes me feel closer to home.": "Liu",
  "The gospel sets us free to become the romantic leaders of our marriages without fright or hesitation. Because we have been forever wooed by Jesus, we are now free to forever woo our wives.": "Tullian",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic. I love love. My middle name is Love. Valentine's Day is my favorite holiday. I want to have a family and children. I am a sucker for every romantic comedy that comes out.": "Jennifer",
  "I had a romantic, 'Aren't I a good girl?' take on divorce, but the truth is that was stupid.": "Ali",
  "I will always be the hopeless romantic, more often pathetic than heroic.": "Chris",
  "Being black, Latino, or Asian is not a genre. Romantic comedies, thrillers, action - those are genres. I think there's a lot of people who want to have the conversation. I don't think people are afraid of it, I just think it's the time to have that conversation. Race is not a genre.": "Mara",
  "Normally, things are viewed in these little segmented boxes. There's classical, and then there's jazz; romantic, and then there's baroque. I find that very dissatisfying. I was trying to find the thread that connects one type of music - one type of musician - to another, and to follow that thread in some kind of natural, evolutionary way.": "Jerry",
  "New York was no mere city. It was instead an infinitely romantic notion, the mysterious nexus of all love and money and power, the shining and perishable dream itself.": "Joan",
  "I once took the key off my girlfriend's key ring so that I could surprise her when she got home. So I did this whole romantic setup in our bedroom with flowers and rose petals. She was so mad when she got home, but then when she walked in, she was so surprised.": "Trey",
  "With 'Attachments,' my goal was to write a really good romantic comedy. I wanted the reader to be smiling throughout.": "Rainbow",
  "I don't think of death in a romantic way anymore.": "Robert",
  "In terms of level of difficulty, it would go comedy, thriller, and then romantic drama.": "Sydney",
  "I'm always trying to reach a transcendent point, a romantic point, but reach it in a really unconventional way, a really profane way. To get to that romantic, touching, heartbreaking place, but through a lot of acts of profanity.": "Chuck",
  "I am completely open to doing a romantic comedy, but I will never do something just for the sake of doing a specific genre or because it's the time or place to do a different type of movie. I think that would be a huge mistake.": "Leonardo",
  "Upsi is definitely the more romantic of the two. I am more laid back. We do have our differences of opinion sometimes. Upsi is always the first one to break the ice after an argument or a difference of opinion. That's what I love most about her.": "Ram",
  "If you look at romantic comedies as pieces of commerce, the audience is looking for wish fulfillment.": "Tom",
  "I don't understand why every guy is not a romantic. I enjoy it.": "Aaron",
  "I don't get off on romantic parts. But I often think if I had had my dental work done early on, well, maybe.": "Morgan",
  "Fall 2013 was inspired by the 1970s equestrian lifestyle. I wanted to incorporate the moody and romantic - intricate baroque detailing and classic menswear elements - with something tougher and edgier in a nod to London's rock n' roll underground.": "Rachel",
  "I love crying at romantic movies like 'The Notebook.' I'm always bawling.": "Fergie",
  "The vampire was a complete change from the usual romantic characters I was playing, but it was a success.": "Bela",
  "I am a die-hard romantic at heart and love the idea of love. But, when it comes to love, I kinda believe in the old world charm of romance - where there's mystery and intrigue.": "Esha",
  "Couples without kids have each other, their friends, families, and Siri to talk to. It's not like they're quarantining themselves in an underground bunker, never to take a romantic stroll on the beach or attend a Morrissey concert ever again. They're just using birth control.": "Jen",
  "I had written many things as a journalist, but I had no idea if I could write something scary or romantic or touching that wasn't me writing about someone else's life story. It was really exciting to try.": "Jeff",
  "Classical, Romantic, and Baroque music, that's what I really like.": "Joan",
  "Without romance, films will be boring. I doubt if people now understand romance, though they may claim it otherwise. I am very romantic in real life.": "Sunny",
  "I find it incredibly romantic that people should fight for a cause they believe in and be prepared to die for it.": "James",
  "I'm not what you might call sexy, but I'm romantic. Let's put it that way.": "Betty",
  "The word 'romance,' according to the dictionary, means excitement, adventure, and something extremely real. Romance should last a lifetime.": "Billy",
  "If a June night could talk, it would probably boast it invented romance.": "Bernard",
  "I'm a feminist, but I think that romance has been taken away a bit for my generation. I think what people connect with in novels is this idea of an overpowering, encompassing love - and it being more important and special than anything and everything else.": "Emma",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic. I buy things because I fall in love with them. I never buy anything just because it's valuable.": "Iris",
  "We believe that according the name 'investors' to institutions that trade actively is like calling someone who repeatedly engages in one-night stands a 'romantic.'": "Warren",
  "So the lover must struggle for words.": "T.",
  "It's easy to get wrapped up in sharing everyday life with a partner. It's fun to get lost in love and romance. It's the best. But holding on to yourself while doing that is the most important thing.": "Brittany",
  "I am a romantic, and I think dates are wonderful. I like quirky and fun things. Like going for a bike ride or for a pedicure together.": "Nargis",
  "If I can give you one strong piece of advice, when you go away for that romantic weekend, whatever you do, do not accept or take the upgrade to the honeymoon suite.": "Gordon",
  "The male is always the pawn in a romantic comedy. Come together, break up, go chase her, get her, roll credits. That's what happens in all of them.": "Matthew",
  "I love the concept of the romance that exists when people are broken. Like, the promise of a romance when you're at the bottom. I think that's infinitely compelling and romantic.": "Shane",
  "I am a hopeless romantic and I love to spoil my girlfriends.": "Orlando",
  "The state of New Jersey is really two places - terrible cities and wonderful suburbs. I live in the suburbs, the final battleground of the American dream, where people get married and have kids and try to scratch out a happy life for themselves. It's very romantic in that way, but a bit naive. I like to play with that in my work.": "Harlan",
  "I'd always thought hurricanes were romantic, with pretty feminine names like Celestine.": "Mark",
  "Am I a romantic? I've seen 'Wuthering Heights' ten times. I'm a romantic.": "Johnny",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic. It's disgusting. It really is. I've seen 'While You Were Sleeping', like, twenty times, and I still believe in the whole Prince Charming thing.": "Jennifer",
  "You do your work as a photographer and everything becomes past. Words are more like thoughts; the photographer's picture is always surrounded by a kind of romantic glamor - no matter what you do, and how you twist it.": "Robert",
  "I am not an adolescent, nor a romantic. I analyze objectively.": "Dilma",
  "It's glorious to be able to go onto the Internet and hear any kind of music anywhere, from anywhere, and get it instantly. But there's also something glorious about having a record with a sleeve and looking at the artwork, putting it on the turntable and playing it, there's still something romantic to me about that.": "Conor",
  "I like sundresses with cowboy boots, little shorts with big wedge heels and a big piece of turquoise. I also love classic, Old Hollywood romantic styles. I'm 'country girl meets city girl' circa 1930.": "Kirsten",
  "In a big Bollywood romantic film, taking my shirt off and spreading the hand towards the mountain with dancers behind me are not my cup of tea.": "Vir",
  "It gives me immense pleasure to be trustworthy, faithful, and true - to have the kind of romantic bond that inspires this.": "Kate",
  "We are all the heroes and heroines of our own lives. Our love stories are amazingly romantic our losses and betrayals and disappointments are gigantic in our own minds. ": "Maeve",
  "Romantic comedies are particularly hard to make.": "D.",
  "I don't make romantic films. I make films about human relationships.": "Yash",
  "I love being manipulated by what I see. I love weepies and romantic comedies where you're reaching for the Kleenex at the right moment.": "Nick",
  "Mixed messages are just part and parcel of the romantic terrain, and rather than berate yourself for any crossed wires, you'd do better to work on your future resilience.": "Mariella",
  "Great companies start because the founders want to change the world... not make a fast buck. Call me a romantic, but I think entrepreneurs should try to change the world. This comes from working at Apple... old habits die hard.": "Guy",
  "Those fields of daisies we landed on, and dusty fields and desert stretches. Memories of many skies and earths beneath us - many days, many nights of stars.": "Anne",

  "I am a better person when I let myself have the time for romance and for love.": "Diane",
  "I used to be a hopeless romantic - I fell in love with everyone I went out with.": "Jeremy",

  "We must not, however, be like the leaders of the great romantic revolt who, in their eagerness to get rid of the husk of convention, disregarded also the humane aspiration.": "Irving",
  "Consider what a romantic expedition you are on take notes. ": "Anne",

  "Any romantic feelings for a 12-year-old are like entering into a fantasy world.": "Wes",
  "I try to speak of a love that not necessarily romantic. I think there is so much love between people and so much love people want to give but it's harder and harder these days to show that, to celebrate that, you know?": "Emeli",
  "I think romantic comedy, when done right, is my favorite genre. It's just a genre that's very human.": "Lena",

  "I guess I'm a bit of a romantic.": "Felicity",
  "I get some of my ideas from watching my three daughters, but most of them come from my own memories of growing up. I can remember how romantic I was, not just about love, but romance in the classic sense - the romantic ideals: of honor and truth, of loyalty, sacrifice and fairness. Those were the elements that made a story satisfying to me.": "Francine",
  "If it's a romantic holiday, the only thing I need is my wife. We love quiet and calm places where we can't be disturbed. Neither of us likes being in busy places; we would much rather stay in our hotel room and enjoy each other's company.": "Jean",
  "I've seen plays that are, objectively, total messes that move me in ways that their tidier brethren do not. That's the romantic mystery of great theater. Translating this ineffability into printable prose is a challenge that can never be fully met.": "Ben",
  "I have a romantic conception of the writer's life, and the sort of writer's life that I admire is probably a childless life, possibly a marriageless life, certainly a travelling life - I'm in awe of how much D.H. Lawrence managed to get around. But that's never been something I'm capable of doing.": "Rachel",
  "I was pleasantly disappointed on entering Bohemia. Instead of a dull, uninteresting country, as I expected, it is a land full of the most lovely scenery. There is every thing which can gratify the eye - high blue mountains, valleys of the sweetest pastoral look and romantic old ruins.": "Bayard",
  "I don't want to be typecast as a heroine who does a certain kind of cinema, which is why I experiment with the types of films that I do. But yes, I won't deny that romantic love stories or romantic comedies are what I enjoy doing the most, because as an audience those are the kind of films that I like watching.": "Deepika",
  "I am quite a romantic person, really, and I should have put that into my music earlier, but I was probably denying it... I didn't want to be soft because I felt I had to be so hard to get people to believe in me.": "Billy",
  "A shiny ring isn't romantic to me. I think thought and love into what you do for the person you're in love with - that's romance.": "Sasha",
  "Surrealism was necessary - essential, even - in the 1920s to bridge the gap between rationalism and the subconscious. It started something important. But by the early '60s, it had become petit-bourgeois; it was too intellectual and romantic, and had ground to a halt. It had become respectable.": "Alejandro",
  "Vampires have become tragic or romantic figures. Vampire are largely seduction tales. They're no longer the scary creature in the dark.": "Stephen",
  "I think the first time I tried to write a romantic song, it was just horrendously embarrassing. I remember thinking, 'Okay, I'm not going to do that anymore.' I think that sort of embarrassed me for the next 10 years.": "Tobias",

  "I'm very romantic and of course I want to be in love.": "Emma",
  "I admit I do have some drawbacks and limitations as a candidate. Although I am a professional comedian, some of my critics maintain that this is not enough. I cannot deny that I stand before you untested and inexperienced - I only spent two years in television, never as a romantic lead or a song and dance man.": "Pat",
  "I find 'Fatal Attraction' really romantic. I really like the seduction. Almost every time I see it, I'm surprised when it goes dark. I know that's the claim to fame, but I key into how genuinely romantic it is.": "Shane",

  "I'd like to be played as a child by Natalie Wood. I'd have some romantic scenes as Audrey Hepburn and have gritty black-and-white scenes as Patricia Neal.": "Gloria",
  "Usually comedy is only available to us ladies in the romantic comedy. That's why I hate romantic comedies.": "Sandra",
  "When you're in the throes of this romantic love, it's overwhelming - you're out of control, you're irrational, you're going to the gym at 6 A.M. every day - Why? Because she's there.": "Helen",
  "To write a novel is to embark on a quest that is very romantic. People have visions, and the next step is to execute them. That's a very romantic project. Like Edvard Munch's strange dreamlike canvases where people are stylized, like 'The Scream.' Munch must have had that vision in a dream, he never saw it.": "Joyce",
  "I absolutely love Ireland. It's one of the most beautiful places on Earth, and I have strong ties here. Both my grandmothers are from Ireland, and I have spent every summer in Bantry since my father, who is an artist, had the romantic idea 20 years ago to buy an old farmhouse on the west coast and renovate it.": "Emily",
  "Personally, I find it romantic not to be with someone all the time; you don't get used to someone or take them for granted.": "Monica",
  "Animals are everywhere. Some are more romantic, like tigers and elephants and chimpanzees, and some are less romantic, like earthworms, but they are just as interesting.": "Isabella",
  "Choosing sepia is all to do with trying to make the image look romantic and idealistic. It's sort of a soft version of propaganda.": "Martin",
  "You think, 'Musicals, they must always be romantic' - You'd be surprised how few of them historically have ever been romantic.": "Harold",
  "Bob Dole is not a romantic, at least not an immediate one. Bob Dole is not one to waste a lot of time on metaphor.": "Jeanne",
  "In the early days of Christianity the exercise of chastity was frequently combined with a close and romantic intimacy of affection between the sexes which shocked austere moralists.": "Havelock",
  "I think I've only done one horror movie, Psycho III. That was a walk in the park compared to a romantic comedy.": "Carter",
  "I don't feel like a romantic lead I guess I feel more like a character actor. ": "Matthew",
  "Some have called we rock and roll performers who never retire 'troubadours.' I enjoy this misnomer immensely. While there are many differences between me and my distant predecessors in L'Occitane, I do believe there is a lineage that connects us of the last 70 years with those romantic singers of the High Middle Ages.": "Frank",
  "I was also the romantic lead in The Boston Strangler - I was the only one that lived to tell the story - so I called myself the romantic lead.": "Sally",
  "Romantic art deals with the exception and with the individual. Good people, belonging as they do to the normal, and so, commonplace type, are artistically uninteresting.": "Oscar",
  "They are just really stupid people in Hollywood. You write them a script, and they say they love it, they absolutely love it. Then they say, 'But doesn't it need a small dog, and an Eskimo, and shouldn't it be set in New Guinea?' And you say, 'But it is a sophisticated romantic comedy set in Paris.'": "P.",
  "Kabul is a walled city, which sounds romantic except the walls are pre-cast reinforced concrete blast barriers, 10 feet tall and 15 feet long and moved into place with cranes. The walls are topped with sandbags, and the sandbags are topped with guard posts from which gun barrels protrude.": "P.",
  "It is possible for a woman to be a romantic, but also to be single and to be happy.": "Taylor",
  "I love Indian, Italian and Mexican food. And if it's a romantic type of thing, I like a good French restaurant.": "Dolly",
  "Young people have this almost romantic attachment to civil rights, liberties, emancipating people from oppression, etc. The idea that such oppression exists in this country offends me, but it's able to be pushed and sold because education in this country is so woefully incompetent and inept.": "Rush",
  "I love romantic poetry.": "Richard",
  "Like almost everything else from the West, the Romantic Revolution arrived late in Russia.": "Tom",
  "I think I give the impression of being a romantic, and I think inside I'm quite severe. But some might say they had the opposite impression of me.": "Tom",
  "As far as the lack of hits goes, I think perhaps it's because I've played a lot of different roles and have not created a persona that the public can latch on to. I have played everything from psychopathic killers to romantic leading men, and in picking such diverse roles I have avoided typecasting.": "Jeff",
  "When I was sixteen, I was an absolutely romantic guy. I fell in love every week. I mean, I was in love with everybody, but unfortunately, nobody was in love with me.": "Alejandro",
  "I love a good romantic comedy.": "Joss",
  "Even now, there are young actors who want careers as romantic leading men, and the best thing is not to reveal you're gay.": "Ian",
  "The huge difference in my lifetime is that you can just go up to somebody and make a pass. You couldn't do that in the 1950s if you were gay. There were secret handshakes, a secret language. There was nowhere you could go to be romantic outside of people's houses.": "Ian",
  "I'm a big movie fan, and I want to make movies in every genre. I want to make my romantic comedy one day.": "James",
  "My political awakening, if I can be as grand as to call it that, was all about what was happening around me. It wasn't some romantic, patriotic vision of Scotland going back to what it had been 300 years previously.": "Nicola",
  "The most romantic thing I ever did to my woman? I painted her toenails!": "Tracy",
  "I did send a girl a plane ticket asking her for a visit, I guess that's quite romantic.": "Orlando",
  "My greatest environments in which I can grow, or grow up, is in personal romantic relationships with a man.": "Alanis",
  "If it was a great script and a great character, I would love to do a romantic comedy.": "Andy",
  "It took me twenty years to get Steven Parrino's work. From the time I first saw his art, in the mid-eighties, I almost always dismissed it as mannered, Romantic, formulaic, conceptualist-formalist heavy-metal boy-art abstraction.": "Jerry",
  "When I got married, the Sun ran the headline: 'Here comes the bride, all fat and wide.' Luckily, it was a few days after the wedding - but it was still hideous to read at a great romantic moment.": "Jo",
  "Having an actual income can expand your romantic horizons toward the more appealing end of the spectrum.": "Al",
  "I like romantic comedy as a genre, but I think it can get stuck in its ways.": "Zooey",
  "Romantic comedies are usually about when love works.": "Zooey",
  "I'm a romantic, but I'm not a romantic in the traditional sense. I like to romanticize what happens to me. Whatever happens to me - you could quantify it as good or bad - I romanticize it. I think along the lines of 'When that thing happened, it made me who I am.' That kind of thing. It's a different way of being romantic.": "Zooey",
  "I am the actor that I am. I do what I do. I've been a 'leading man' playing romantic leads for a long time now.": "Pierce",
  "Suddenly I've got an overwhelming desire to surround myself with the aura of classical and Romantic art.": "Sylvester",
  "I think in general, romantic comedies tend to take one person's point of view, but every once in a while you get something that is balanced for two people.": "Sandra",
  "I've never been a blind romantic.": "Sandra",
  "I have a romantic vision of the beautiful delineation between TV and film that existed for so many years. I romanticize the studio system and movie stars as a whole, but obviously that's just anachronistic and probably a non-reality.": "Chris",
  "My father has been an actor since 1964. Things were tight a lot of the times, financially. It wasn't like a big romantic adventure.": "Chris",
  "For food to be romantic, it should be light. Too many times people plan a romantic meal, and the food is too heavy.": "Jose",
  "I'm fascinated by Comte's clear-eyed analysis of what was wrong with modern society, which is that you've got industrial capitalism on one side and romantic love on the other. Those, along with non-instrumental art, are supposed to get you through the day?": "Alain",
  "I used to be addicted to 'Reader's Digest' growing up. I would read the stories about love, and I guess that's where I became a hopeless romantic. I draw from that a lot.": "Sia",
  "A romantic or classical view of the French approach would have been to say, 'It's a French company; let no one attack it. Let's block any merger. But the reality is Alcatel-Lucent is not a French company; it's a global company. Its main markets are China and the U.S. Its ownership is foreign; most of its managers aren't French.": "Emmanuel",
  "Schumann's 'Quintet in E flat for Piano and Strings' is one of the sublime moments in Romantic music.": "Robert",
  "There are many aspects to directing that have a romantic place in people's minds.": "Adam",
  "Blushing is thought to be linked to increased levels of norepinephrine in the brain, which may be associated with romantic feelings. It signals that we are interested and excited, which is attractive to men.": "Helen",
  "The reason you take antidepressants is to feel calm. And romantic love is not calm - it's elation, it's mood swings, and you're killing all that when you take the drug.": "Helen",
  "Romantic love allows you to focus mating energy. Attachment sustains that relationship as long as necessary to raise your baby.": "Helen",
  "Any kind of novelty or excitement drives up dopamine in the brain, and dopamine is associated with romantic love.": "Helen",
  "I've always maintained that men were more romantic than women.": "Helen",
  "I think romantic love evolved to enable you to focus your mating energy on just one individual at a time, thereby conserving mating time and energy.": "Helen",
  "Anthropologists have found evidence of romantic love in 170 societies. They've never found a society that did not have it.": "Helen",
  "Psychologists maintain that the dizzying feeling of intense romantic love lasts only about 18 months to - at best - three years.": "Helen",
  "You know, I think that romance sort of coincides with effort, so you can fall flat on your face, but as long as you're making a great effort, I think it comes off as romantic.": "Ashton",
  "I think that romance sort of coincides with effort, so you can fall flat on your face, but as long as you're making a great effort, I think it comes off as romantic. So it can be something as simple as, like, if you're someone who doesn't cook, you can make a meal.": "Ashton",
  "I had my baby outside in a thunderstorm. It was really romantic.": "Evangeline",
  "Moving to the country is a very bold thing to do. You can have vague romantic notions about doing that, but in actuality, it can be a terrifying thing.": "Nick",
  "The work ethic at art school is completely different than the work ethic amongst people who get into music. People who paint, it's an honorable thing to spend all day and all night in front of your canvas - that is the romantic vision of the painter.": "Nick",
  "If you're looking to be loved for a part, it's great and enticing to be adorable in a romantic comedy. But then, as an actor, you get stuck.": "Laura",
  "In the romantic sense, I'm pretty useless with guys. If I see somebody who I'm attracted to, generally I just think, 'Oh well, he's not interested in me.' The only time that I talk to guys is when they talk to me first.": "Carrie",
  "A friend of mine wrote a script, a feminist romantic comedy. She had a feminist scholar consult on it. My friend said, 'Oh, my friend Gillian read it and really loved it.' She goes, 'Gillian Jacobs, you mean: Britta Perry, feminist icon?'": "Gillian",
  "As opposed to trying to make a kiss look romantic or sweet or passionate, it's kind of fun to just have the freedom to make it look weird, goofy and awkward.": "Gillian",
  "'Love Letter' reminds me of 'Chocolate Factory' and 'Happy People.' It's a little bit of both of those, yeah. I just wanted it to be classy, man. And romantic. And maybe 10 percent sexy.": "R.",
  "I am so romantic about Gypsies. They're not allowed to do anything until they get married. So they all get married really young, at sixteen.": "Kate",
  "I'm as much a victim of the romantic myth of 'getting away' as anyone else. My head tells me it's myth, but I don't want to believe it is.": "Sydney",
  "Danzon is my favorite Cuban music, played by a traditional string orchestra with flute and piano. It's very formally structured but romantic music, which derives from the French-Haitian contradance.": "Rachel",
  "These women were taking over these former manufacturing warehouses in SoHo and figuring out a way to be fashionable and viable without money. It's hard to imagine a life like that in Manhattan now - there's something romantic about it.": "Rachel",
  "I was thinking 'Love Story', obviously, was a romantic film of that time.": "Felicity",
  "I didn't know what to expect, having not been an artist before. From the outside, you only see romantic snapshots of what seems like a great lifestyle, and it is, but it's also grueling.": "Sam",
  "Death was like love, a romantic escape.": "Brigitte",
  "Is that romantic fantasy real? Um, after kids, no. Take the kids away, I don't know. Depends.": "Robin",
  "If a man lets all of my dogs sleep in the bed with us, then that is the most romantic thing. You must love my dogs in order to love me. A man who is nice to my animals and doesn't shoo them away - well, that's the height of romance.": "Salma",
  "My new movie, Fools Rush In, is a romantic comedy and the girl I play in that is very warm, very sweet.": "Salma",
  "To me, little Mike Wazowski is one of the best characters I ever got to play because he was funny. He was outrageous. He got angry. He was romantic. He was a full, well-rounded character.": "Billy",
  "People love to be listened to and represented, and they love it when they feel like you have some of the same problems that they do. Everybody deals with things like romantic difficulties in relationships and death and cancer and abuse.": "Jason",
  "At the end of the day, if the guy is going to write the girl a letter, whether it's chicken scratch or scribble or looks like a doctor's note, if he takes the time to put pen to paper and not type something, there's something so incredibly romantic and beautiful about that.": "Meghan",
  "I'm from L.A., so I'm used to seeing people in sunglasses and flip-flops. There's something so romantic about a man in a scarf and a knitted hat.": "Meghan",
  "I'm not a romantic. In life I didn't have much experience with romance.": "Ang",
  "Ooh, it's too embarrassing to share my innermost romantic secrets - although I have written Danielle the odd poem. If anything they are more comedic than romantic. They used to be well-received but that was before she started studying Shakespeare at drama college. Now I feel so inept.": "Gary",
  "We have got too many kids around the house to have a romantic meal at home. But Danielle is a fantastic cook. She does a brilliant lasagne, great roasts and a great chilli dish. She knows the way to my heart.": "Gary",
  "I knew I could write infinitely about relationships. That's the most beautiful, most confusing, most rewarding, most heartbreaking thing in our lives - and not just romantic relationships: that's all relationships.": "Spike",
  "I'm always trying to perfect the romantic comedy, though.": "David",
  "There is something about a Luger that separates it from all other handguns, and Luger devotees and Luger society members speak of it in romantic terms that must sound plain nuts to those who consider themselves level-headed.": "Dick",
  "I've been in silly movies and romantic movies and historic movies.": "Kevin",
  "If you look at my movie career, I do switch it up a lot. I'm always looking for a lot of different parts. It's been a while since I've been in a situation that was romantic.": "Kevin",
  "Romantic stuff is not something I really remember.": "Darius",
  "I'm a big romantic, so I love guys who are romantic too.": "Ashley",
  "The telephone, which interrupts the most serious conversations and cuts short the most weighty observations, has a romance of its own.": "Virginia",
  "I personally don't like to go see romantic comedies. But people do want to see them, and they seem to want to see me in them.": "Matthew",
  "For me, the performance was always playing different people. And so when I got older, was no longer the romantic leading movie star, it became more and more interesting for me, the characters I played, you know?": "Michael",
  "I don't think I'm romantic at all. I have a lot of faith in the right thing happening. I don't really hope for a lot of particulars, I just have faith that the right thing will happen most of the time.": "Juliana",
  "I've never tried to reach a certain demographic of an audience or try to say, 'OK, now I'm going to do this type of film to transition myself into more adult roles.' Or a romantic hero. Or whatever it may be - you know what I mean?": "Leonardo",
  "The reason I turn down 99% of a hundred, I mean a thousand, scripts is because romantic comedies are often very romantic but seldom very funny.": "Hugh",
  "As it is, I have a limited range as an actor - light comedy. I have never been a fan of romantic comedies, and yet that is what I have ended up mostly doing.": "Hugh",
  "I never meant to be in romantic comedies; it's just what ended up happening. But they are tricky, in a post-1960s sexual revolution way. It was easier when you couldn't have sex scenes: everything crackled very nicely. They're not easy.": "Hugh",
  "It turns out that a husband who does the laundry, it's very romantic when you're older. And it's hard to believe when you're younger. But it's absolutely true.": "Sheryl",
  "I like romantic dates - going on a long walk in Central Park and then taking the subway downtown and going out to eat and ordering oysters. After that, you walk around again and talk.": "Ansel",
  "My mom is very romantic. As is my dad. They appreciate real romance.": "Ansel",
  "Whenever I'm doing anything romantic with an actor, or if there's a director around, I never want anybody's wife to feel threatened by me.": "Julianne",
  "I don't think of myself as a romantic person; I'm kind of more rough and tumble, I think. The things I'm drawn to are outdoorsy, I only get dressed up when I have to. I'm drawn to women who are into the same type of thing. If you're going to call it romantic, I'm very spontaneous. That's probably the best thing I have going for me.": "Paul",
  "Stand-up is like a row boat: it's fun and romantic when you're choosing to do it. But if you have no other choice than to be in a row boat it's not as enjoyable that's survival. ": "Demetri",
  "That's my biggest struggle, is maintaining a personal romantic relationship. It takes a lot of effort.": "Chelsea",
  "I can't ever see myself playing the romantic lead because that's not me I'm not that girl. ": "Maisie",
  "What I really want is to play the romantic lead and get the girl.": "Peter",
  "You know how you can be romantic? You can be romantic by going to a beautiful setting, sitting on a park bench, and getting good ole-fashioned golden arches, a.k.a. McDonald's. That's probably the best I can do romantically.": "Omari",
  "I always wanted a guitar. I always wanted to be a cowboy singer because I also listened to Hank Williams, and he would always sing these neat romantic songs.": "Dick",
  "It's easier to write from my own life, and it's also more fun. I always write about relationships, for instance, whether they're romantic relationships, friendships, encounters... there's always a lesson to be learned from them.": "Jason",
  "I love getting to bounce around and explore so much. I love Scandinavia. I love Spain. It's so mystical and romantic, yet it's gritty.": "Jason",
  "Romantic comedy has come to mean a couple of moderately talented actors placed in implausible situations obliged to go through a set of paces that are all too familiar, the end result being neither romantic nor comedic.": "Edward",
  "Often, romantic comedies exist in a vacuum, and it's kind of odd.": "Edward",
  "Some nights, a romantic dinner can be killed by having to do dishes afterward, so it probably suits you better to go out for dinner. But I love cooking and always have.": "Jeffrey",
  "Romantic poetry had its heyday when people like Lord Byron were kicking it large. But you try and make a living as a poet today, and you'll find it's very different!": "Alan",
  "You only need to look at Jane Austen to see how crossed wires can become a defining aspect of romantic life. Then again, if the course of true love ran more smoothly, it would have a terribly detrimental effect on our cache of love stories.": "Mariella",
  "Far too many girls' and women's romantic relationships are formed around a negation of their own worth and attributes rather than a confirmation of them.": "Mariella",
  "Girls have a tendency to take responsibility for romantic misinterpretations, when often it's men whose perfectly honed emotional inscrutability makes life more complicated than it should be.": "Mariella",
  "In 1998, it was possible to make a big-screen romantic comedy about email. Yep, email - the same medium we often think of now as boring and even annoying.": "Walt",
  "That's so romantic, to wake up and find that he's packed a bag - and that for the next 48 hours, everything is taken care of.": "Hannah",
  "I love romantic comedies. I have a deep respect for them. I think they're really difficult to write and write well.": "Rashida",
  "You know, I grew up on romantic comedies, and it's hard to find a new way to tell that story.": "Rashida",
  "I'm a romantic. I like romantic movies.": "Chris",
  "There's always something heroic and romantic about taking a stand against the powers that be.": "Greg",
  "I've done romantic comedy, and I don't get to flex that muscle often.": "Hill",
  "I believed that the husband takes care of the family, and the wife takes care of him, and they are true to each other. I know that sounds a romantic illusion, but it can be true.": "Debbie",
  "I love my wife dearly, and, therefore, I've never cooked a meal, romantic or otherwise, for her.": "Steve",
  "My books are love stories at core, really. But I am interested in manifestations of love beyond the traditional romantic notion. In fact, I seem not particularly inclined to write romantic love as a narrative motive or as an easy source of happiness for my characters.": "Khaled",
  "A man's ability to haggle is never a turn-on. The only thing less romantic than how much you paid is how much you saved. The last thing we want to hear is how you talked the jeweler down on our new earrings.": "Jennifer",
  "I think as a young actress, it's very rare that you read something where you're not either 'the girl' or there to serve some romantic purpose in a male dominated cast.": "Sienna",
  "I was blinded by being a romantic person.": "Sienna",
  "The amount of speculation surrounding my romantic life is astounding. It's strange how involved people get: invested and angry, really disappointed.": "Sienna",
  "War is terrible. There is nothing romantic about war.": "Martin",
  "Somehow, the French got this idea of the starving artist. Very romantic, except it's not so romantic for the starving artist.": "David",
  "There is always something I gain from watching a movie, whether it's a silly romantic comedy or an art film.": "Gia",
  "Just because a romantic relationship ends doesn't mean that the other facets of your relationship have to end... or, indeed, doesn't mean they can't get better.": "Chris",
  "I love the solitary, romantic idea of writing.": "Rebecca",
  "I'm very much a romantic. I'm highly attuned to an older sensibility, which I believe is alive and well. We're not that far ahead of the Romantic Age in society.": "Rufus",
  "The Germany I was enthused with was more old fashioned and kind of romantic. I just got there, and the next thing you know, I had this huge gilded album. It was kind of an amazing experience because I didn't intend it to be that way.": "Rufus",
  "I don't get a lot of romantic comedy scripts.": "Ryan",
  "The problem with romantic comedies is you know the ending by the poster. So they're not movies you can keep doing over and over again expect satisfaction somehow.": "Ryan",
  "I think there is always romantic tension between Lois Lane and Clark Kent.": "Gene",
  "Numerous studies have shown how when one person in a romantic coupling gets depressed, the other becomes more depressed.": "Karen",
  "I am not a dreamer. I am a football romantic.": "Jurgen",
  "I think that, occasionally, fame and popularity can garner more attention for individuals or films. But as a person who believes in my craft, I like the romantic notion that skill and hard work is more important than notoriety.": "Nargis",
  "Akshay's idea of a romantic date is a six-kilometre jog, followed by 500 crunches... together! Eeeeks!": "Twinkle",
  "I want to do the romantic comedies. You know, the stuff that Meg Ryan and Julia Roberts or Reese Witherspoon would choose, of course.": "Jessica",
  "I'd done a bachelor's degree, which I'd enjoyed, but I didn't know what to do with my life at the time. I was conflicted, and, being a hopeless romantic, I followed my girlfriend at the time to Vanderbilt, where, obviously, we broke up a couple of months later.": "Duncan",
  "Dame Barbara Cartland was an endearing eccentric, and when I interviewed her, she wanted me to listen to her dictating to her secretary one of those romantic novels that she turned out fortnightly.": "Melvyn",
  "All of us have a romantic streak in us. That's why we are fallible, aren't we?": "Kapil",
  "An excellent wine, someone's best attempt at cooking, and the candles and flowers on the table can turn the simplest dinner into an unforgettably romantic event.": "Letitia",
  "Acting can be pretty challenging. I can't say making a romantic comedy is challenging, but to do anything well, you have to put yourself into it.": "John",
  "But no, I don't really like romantic comedies, so I don't really care. I never go see 'em.": "John",
  "I feel close to Lloyd in 'Say Anything'. He was like a super-interesting version of me. Only I'm not as good as him. Whatever part of me is romantic and optimistic, I reached into that to play Lloyd.": "John",
  "I think that taking night trains or meeting someone on the road is pretty romantic. I've done a couple of things like that. I've surprised someone in Paris. And hopefully, when you surprise someone, they're happy to see you.": "John",
  "Despite massive evidence to the contrary, libertarians hold tight to their romantic concept of capitalism, which, freed from government interference, serves the consumer with the best products at the lowest prices.": "Paul",
  "Junooniyat for love but not necessarily from the romantic perspective. For me, that is for family, that is for my work. For me, both these things are very important, so there is junoon for people I love, which is my family, and my work, which I worship.": "Yami",
  "To do a romantic scene is the most unromantic thing to do on screen.": "Yami",
  "Once I got married and had kids, I moved away from romantic roles, because it seemed wrong to have my three-year-old wondering why Daddy was kissing someone else.": "Chevy",
  "My most romantic job: I was a manager at Baskin-Robbins.": "Eric",
  "Julia Roberts and Sandra Bullock do romantic comedies. I do dark dramas. I do these movies well.": "Jodie",

  "A romantic relationship requires honesty between a couple.": "Tzipi",
  "In my opinion, British women are more romantic than French ones.": "Jean-Michel",
  "I love romantic comedies. I like to watch them and I like to be in them. It's something that's increasingly difficult to find that spark of originality that makes if different than the ones that come before.": "Julia",
  "The underdog winning is the romantic position.": "Malcolm",
  "Being single, I thought would be fun, but it is terribly boring. And I am a romantic, but only when I am in love. I can't force it otherwise.": "Jacqueline",
  "When I am in love, I am ridiculously and hopelessly romantic.": "Jacqueline",
  "My wife would say I'm not romantic at all, but I would say that I'm the ultimate romancer because I write about... life being brilliant.": "Noel",
  "Romantic love, or sex, is the only good thing in a life that is being lived in a dark way.": "Alan",
  "I don't know if I'd want to be a Secret Service agent. In the movies, it's exciting and romantic and all that. Really, most of their job is standing in a hallway for 12 hours making sure somebody doesn't come through a doorway off of a stairwell.": "Dennis",
  "I am a huge romantic at heart.": "Armaan",
  "I don't see people who are eager for shutdowns. While some people have a romantic ideal about shutdowns, the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats believe you have to try to work problems out rather than having a shutdown.": "James",
  "I am a very romantic person, and I love 'love' - however cheesy that sounds!": "Armaan",
  "I can sing in various genres, but my heart truly lies in singing romantic songs. This has been my forte ever since I was 8 or 9.": "Armaan",
  "The most contemporary film I can think of is your standard romantic comedy, but the minute you make them, they already look so aged.": "Rupert",
  "I loved the whole New Romantic, New Wave thing... New Order, Soft Cell, Depeche Mode, Gary Numan, Blancmange, Yazoo.": "John",
  "Despite not looking like a matinee idol, I feel like I have a lot to give. I've never had any trouble with women. People are always surprised with the romantic aspect of my movies.": "John",
  "I read too many romance novels during my formative years. I have a penchant for romantic comedies. I understand why 'Romeo and Juliet' came to such a pass.": "Roxane",
  "I would pretend to be the French lieutenant's woman. I was always a romantic. I still am, actually.": "Helena",
  "Marriage is like the romantic ideal, and yet the trappings around it and the culture about it are really the opposite of that.": "Lydia",
  "A romantic comedy has to be funny and make you think about life but the obstacle that has to be overcome is key. ": "Jennifer",
  "There's no shame in being romantic at all. I think people want to feel that sense of romance, which is rarely even attempted anymore.": "Colin",
  "'Intelligent Life' is kind of a companion piece to 'Safety Not Guaranteed.' Internally, it's a sci-fi romantic thriller.": "Colin",
  "I've always been attracted to romantic secondhand clothes. But my style developed as I started going to these strange raves where everybody had these very definitive costumes.": "Florence",

  "I happen to be really a romantic.": "Amanda",
  "My overall quest is always to do something that's somehow different from whatever it is that I just got done doing. If that can include occasionally playing an older guy who has a romantic side and a romantic relationship, than that's a real treat.": "J.",
  "There's another film - a little Greek movie - that hopefully is going to get some distribution here in the U.S., called 'Worlds Apart,' where I also play a 60-year-old guy who looks a lot like J.K. Simmons, who has a romantic relationship with an appropriate woman.": "J.",
  "I read a very romantic book when I was young, when I was in college: Rilke's 'Letters to a Young Poet.' And I've always felt that if you are in any kind of an artistic, creative endeavor, and you feel there's something else you can do for a living and be happy, I think you should do something else.": "J.",
  "I think people get a sense of possibility when they're on a plane, even romantic possibility, wondering if the perfect person is going to sit down next to them or something.": "Walter",
  "I'm a romantic slob!": "Willie",
  "It's a bit of a cliche, but I think girls like to get flowers. I think books are quite romantic, too. If you can find an interesting book, that brings something out in your partner that can be very romantic.": "Douglas",
  "It's great to fall head over heels in love at a fast pace, and nothing's more romantic, but you need to look after yourself.": "Douglas",
  "I'm pretty romantic.": "Douglas",
  "I'm really kind of a little bit romantic for the lost era. There's a lot of us that are - kind like James Murphy, same thing - we feel like it's this magic era that happened before us. And it wasn't even necessarily disco.": "Mike",
  "Dub has been a big influence in terms of production. It's inspired so many people and so much music - in terms of music where mixing desk was the instrument. Central to that is the echo chamber, and I think there's a little bit of a romantic thing there.": "Mike",
  "The life of Edward Estlin Cummings began with a childhood in Cambridge, Mass., that he described as happy, but he struggled in both his artistic and romantic exploits against the piousness of his father, an esteemed Harvard professor.": "Billy",
  "I find short, fast romances romantic. There's a beauty to dark imagery.": "Sam",
  "I'm not trying to be romantic. I think you can tell when people are trying to be sexy onstage. When I was doing 'All the Way,' I was really thinking about my wife. People don't know my personal experience, but they can tell it's an honest interpretation.": "Harry",
  "When people discuss the 1960s and the great Civil Rights Era, they often speak in romantic terms as if there wasn't immense work put in, and as if there wasn't immense sacrifice that took place. But none of those battles were easily fought and won; there were sustained movements behind them.": "Al",
  "It's a very romantic sentiment, but to think that you would die if you didn't write, well, I would definitely choose to not write and live.": "Sarah",
  "I will never say never, but I will say never to doing the more typical romantic comedies. You know, unless I'm getting audited and I'm on the street and I desperately need some dough and that's the only thing that I'm getting.": "Christian",
  "In terms of the romantic kind of lead, I just never enjoy those movies very much. Maybe they'll come to interest me more as I get older. I doubt it, but maybe. Romantic comedies tend to be, for me, an oxymoron.": "Christian",
  "The only thing I would unequivocally say is that I have never had any interest in romantic comedy I just couldn't do it. I think I'd be terrible.": "Christian",
  "Any woman can make pole dancing a regular part of their exercise routine - and a fun part of their romantic life!": "Kendra",
  "Americans have always been excellent at making romantic comedies - but dramatically, we don't really try to do it.": "James",
  "The state of being in love is so inherently preposterous. It usually lends itself to romantic comedy. I think we've all been there.": "James",
  "I want to play a villain. I want to play a romantic heroine.": "Allison",
  "I realize that no one is going to come to me and ask me to be Julius Caesar or a romantic lead, but I think I'm a certain type of guy who looks a certain way, and that's just the reality of things.": "Dennis",
  "There has always been a tension in my life between the romantic and the practical. I can't hole myself up in a cabin and write down ideas for the rest of my life. I also need to be able to clean out a dog bite.": "Ethan",
  "Everything is just so much more romantic and real when it's yours and it's private.": "Dove",
  "I've always considered myself a fairly romantic person. I believe in love and falling in love at a young age.": "Mandy",
  "I've had fun doing romantic comedies, but I just can't anymore. There's nothing fulfilling creatively, there's nowhere to grow, nothing to learn from it or for yourself. I'd rather just be home with my family or write music until that special project comes my way.": "Mandy",
  "I don't think Hollywood knows what to do with me. I would imagine that when it comes to romantic comedies, my name would be pretty low down on the list.": "Gary",
  "Kissing scenes are never romantic or sexy. They're actually super technical, like, 'Move your head; you're blocking her light,' or, 'Stop looking like an idiot when you kiss her.'": "Will",
  "I love stories with love in them. I just prefer those films. Every so often, I come across a film where there's no love story. It doesn't have to be romantic, but there's a lack of love, and I don't get that.": "Rachel",
  "There's something really great and romantic about being poor and sleeping on couches.": "Ben",
  "I love surprises - champagne and strawberries, all that pampering, romantic stuff. Guys ought to know how to pamper their women properly.": "Danica",
  "I think I'm a romantic person, yeah.": "Antonio",
  "After Fergie and Prince Andrew honeymooned at Le Touessrok in Mauritius, Bobby, my late husband, and I were first to stay in their suite. We enjoyed the benefits - all the spoils and the special luxuries. We practically had our own private beach, and it was most romantic.": "Cilla",
  "I had my first real kiss at Magic Mountain on a park bench. Not the most romantic thing ever.": "Vanessa",
  "I have played so many romantic roles that I don't know if I am really a romantic in real life. I get confused about the real me.": "Dhanush",
  "You know, I've always thought that it would be really funny if somebody made a romantic comedy where absolutely everything went well from beginning to end.": "Fiona",
  "I'm not a romantic.": "Jack",
  "I proposed to my wife on Brighton Beach, and she said yes. That's pretty romantic. Even though I forgot to go down on one knee because I was too busy trying to compose the question.": "Robert",
  "I hope that I would be considered romantic. I don't know... one of my favorite movies is 'The Notebook' so I guess that would be considered romantic. But I think being romantic is more than the flowers and the gifts. It's about connecting with the person and being able to talk and share things with her.": "Taylor",
  "So many women today have become so focused on their children, they've developed these romantic entanglements with their children's lives, and the husbands are secondary. They're left out. And the romantic focus is on the children.": "Ayelet",
  "Is Valentine's Day a day to make cupcakes with your children? No, Valentine's is supposed to be a day about romantic love.": "Ayelet",
  "I don't have any romantic ideas about marriage. Trust me. A white dress... ? No. It's not something for me.": "Diane",
  "When I was younger - it might be a romantic idea - I always thought I might go crazy.": "Diane",
  "It's funny, I can sit through the worst horror film ever made but even a quite good romantic comedy can drive me nuts.": "Jason",
  "I am very romantic. Given a choice, I'd do only romantic films!": "Sonam",
  "Even actresses that you really admire, like Reese Witherspoon, you think, 'Another romantic comedy?' You see her in something like 'Walk the Line' and think, 'God, you're so great!' And then you think, 'Why is she doing these stupid romantic comedies?' But of course, it's for money and status.": "Gwyneth",
  "I had these kind of unrealistic expectations that were fueled by romantic comedies, and it has both helped me and hurt me in many ways. It helped me because, in general, they've made me hopeful. I just figure things will eventually work out for me. But nobody is like any Tom Hanks character. Nobody is Hugh Grant. No one is Meg Ryan!": "Mindy",
  "I regard romantic comedies as a subgenre of sci-fi, in which the world operates according to different rules than my regular human world.": "Mindy",
  "I have such a rich fantasy life, I can't help it. I do make up a lot of romantic stories in my head.": "Mindy",
  "Woody Allen is really the ultimate. I love that he believed in himself enough to do what he did. And I have that same feeling - that there's nobody that looks like me in movies, nobody would cast me as a romantic lead, but I want to do it and I feel confident that I can.": "Mindy",
  "When men hear women want a commitment, they think it means commitment to a romantic relationship, but that's not it. It's a commitment to not floating around anymore. I want a guy who is entrenched in his own life. Entrenched is awesome.": "Mindy",
  "On 'The Office,' so much of the show is about disguising your true feelings and your romantic feelings because it was a mock documentary.": "Mindy",
  "Neutrinos alone, among all the known particles, have ethereal properties that are striking and romantic enough both to have inspired a poem by John Updike and to have sent teams of scientists deep underground for 50 years to build huge science-fiction-like contraptions to unravel their mysteries.": "Lawrence",
  "The most conventional romantic trope of all is that you put lovers under extreme pressure, where they have to make decisions that illuminate aspects of that bond.": "Lenny",
  "I am very romantic. In fact, I just renewed my vows... although it was with another woman.": "Kevin",
  "That's what I like about film-it can be bizarre, classic, normal, romantic. Cinema is to me the most versatile thing.": "Catherine",
  "I love it when a man cooks it's one of those points that makes me adore a guy. I think it's so romantic and I feel cared for when a man cooks. ": "Olga",
  "I'm a bit of a romantic. In theory!": "Olga",
  "With clothing being designed that allows you to be hugged virtually, video conferencing becoming ever sharper, and our social and romantic lives increasingly taking place online, the gap between the physical and the virtual is getting ever smaller.": "Noreena",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic, and very much the person in a relationship to go: If things are going well, I'll buy the flowers, remember the dates of things, plan fun nights out.": "Jennifer",
  "I'd like to do 'My Best Friend's Wedding,' 'Pretty Woman,' Meg Ryan type stuff. Romantic comedies. I'd love to do some action stuff as well.": "Jennifer",
  "Personally, I can't see why it would be any less romantic to find a husband in a nice four-color catalogue than in the average downtown bar at happy hour.": "Barbara",
  "The dark comedies tend to be in a non-releasable area. There can be romantic comedies. There can be dramas. But there's no 'dark comedy' inbox for the advertising.": "Gus",
  "I wanted to tell a romantic and dark side of Ottoman history that was also slightly political, saying to the previous generation of writers, 'Look, I'm interested in Ottoman things, and I'm not afraid of it, and I'm doing something creative.'": "Orhan",
  "My home is attached to a study - in fact, my home is my study, and I have a little room to sleep in. I need to write looking onto the street or a landscape. Looking at reality from some distance gives me romantic visions.": "Orhan",
  "My husband, Sal, and I put date nights on the calendar once a week. I know that doesn't sound romantic, but otherwise it won't get done.": "Sherri",
  "I think when romantic comedies are done well, it's a great genre. 'When Harry Met Sally' is kind of a benchmark for me, but I'm very happy to admit that I love 'Pretty Woman.' I do! It's a great film, and so is 'Sixteen Candles.' I was a big John Hughes fan - still am. I have moments where I have to watch a Hughes film.": "Jamie",
  "I had to satisfy the action fans, the romantic fans, the intellectual fans. It was a terrific burden.": "Sidney",
  "I'm a romantic guy.": "Fred",
  "Growing up, a film was an action film or it was a comedy or it was romantic, but you don't really see such stark lines between genres nowadays.": "Beck",
  "I grew up in southeastern Oklahoma on a working cattle ranch, and it was always very romantic to me: The West, the cowboy, the Western way of life.": "Reba",
  "What Romantic terminology called genius or talent or inspiration is nothing other than finding the right road empirically, following one's nose, taking shortcuts.": "Italo",
  "I broke my nose in gym when a ball hit me. I took a girl to her debutante ball the next week wearing a tux and a big, honking bandage. Not the romantic night she had in mind.": "Wentworth",
  "I'm such a romantic at heart.": "Morten",
  "The first thing that inspires me is my mood, but I take inspiration from a lot of things: a rock song, a romantic movie or a specific lifestyle, like 1960s London and, of course, Italian 'dolce vita!'": "Chiara",
  "I've done a few old-style romantic leads now.": "Richard",
  "That on a romantic level, if you feel it about somebody and it's pure, it means that they do too.": "Sean",
  "I am not married, no. I wasn't really into the notion when I was younger, but now I think a proposal is the ultimate romantic gesture.": "Miranda",
  "I'm a complete romantic - it's why I always get married. Someone should really stop me.": "Pamela",
  "I have tender, romantic associations with upstate New York.": "Vera",
  "It's so often that I read for the bouncy, sunny girl men fall in love with who will solve all the romantic problems in the narrative. I don't choose to work that way.": "Sarah",
  "Sepia in particular tends to make everything look a bit romantic and almost sentimental, hence the fact that it remains such a popular choice for wedding photographs.": "Martin",
  "Essentially, I spent most of my childhood with my mother and my older sister, and I suppose I had rather a romantic vision of how things might be if there were men around; I saw myself in a country house with six children and a garden. That has never been achieved - and I still regret it.": "Claire",
  "When I first started drawing the earliest incarnation of 'Optic Nerve,' I hadn't even been on a date; I hadn't had a romantic relationship of any kind yet, so in a way, I was almost writing science fiction.": "Adrian",
  "I grew up with a very romantic, idealized vision of New York, probably because of all the books I read and the movies I watched.": "Adrian",
  "Marriage is not simply a romantic union between two people it's also a political and economic contract of the highest order. ": "Elizabeth",
  "You could argue that 'Sweeney Todd' was romantic, if you looked closely at it, but it didn't impart that to its audiences. But it's large, and it's melodramatic, and it's a style I like to work in periodically.": "Harold",
  "'Natural Born Killers' is really a misunderstood romantic comedy.": "Woody",
  "The other two things are... well, I had a huge appetite for old black and white movies on BBC 2. At the weekends they used to run matinees, and the more romantic the better.": "Ewan",
  "I wouldn't feel satisfied being on set every day doing a romantic comedy - I'd be bored to death.": "Joaquin",
  "I fell in love with many women at school who had no idea I existed. I'm a bit of a romantic.": "Eric",
  "I'm a bit of a romantic.": "Eric",
  "I can sit in front of the TV and watch an old romantic film and be transfixed.": "Amber",
  "By all but the pathologically romantic, it is now recognized that this is not the age of the small man.": "John",
  "Wave after wave of love flooded the stage and washed over me, the beginning of the one great durable romance of my life.": "Bette",
  "My granddaddy on my momma's side, he was a romantic. He loved love songs. Every Valentine's Day, I remember him buying a red carnation for my grandmomma, my momma and my sister. That was something you could count on every year.": "Josh",
  "I could never understand, when I watch romantic comedies, the notion that for some reason, unattractive or heavy people don't fall in love. If they do, it's in some odd, kooky, roundabout way - and it's not. It's exactly the same.": "James",
  "I'm not a big fan of romantic comedies, believe it or not.": "Kate",
  "I do know that I like to play characters that are sometimes a little on the outside - that's because it feels kind of romantic and sexier to me. I really think they are the people that we learn lessons from.": "Willem",
  "I had no romantic interest in Gable. I considered him an older man.": "Gene",
  "Remember, beneath every cynic there lies a romantic, and probably an injured one.": "Glenn",
  "I feel about romance the same way I do about a vocation: it's a calling. You have an inner intuition, an inner 'yes.' I don't know if it's destined or not, but certainly I couldn't imagine being the person I am today without the romantic experiences I've had.": "Alden",
  "I don't have a favourite romantic scene, but I enjoy romantic movies like 'Ghost' and 'Music and Lyrics.'": "Hansika",
  "You know, I always got offered other stuff. Not the romantic leads, obviously. But very often it's a role that's underwritten, where the character has no personality at all. And they need a character actor who can fill it in.": "Harvey",
  "A romantic date for me is sitting in pajamas and being with a guy with whom I can be myself.": "Alia",
  "I don't find these technical things like flowers and chocolates romantic at all. I think Valentine's Day makes no sense.": "Alia",
  "I always think the most romantic books or films are the ones where the romance doesn't happen, because it makes your heart ache so much watching it.": "Natalie",
  "Vision is a romantic thing. We have got into 'talent identification'. I am much more interested in passion - finding people who are really excited about doing something.": "Sebastian",
  "With the first commandment, Mohammed tried to imprison common sense. And with the second commandment, the beautiful, romantic side of mankind was enslaved.": "Ayaan",
  "I guess it's ridiculously romantic, but I wanted to be a full tilt, sink-or-swim writer.": "Daniel",
  "In grammar school I read 'Act One' by Moss Hart, and being a playwright struck me as the most magical and romantic career anyone could have... But I never did write a play.": "Alice",
  "Right away I think of two books - 'Wuthering Heights' and 'Rebecca' - and of just sinking into them as a young reader. I think they must have appealed not just to my romantic adolescent soul, but I suppose there's also an appealing darkness in both of them.": "Alice",
  "I am still a hard-core romantic.": "Divyanka",
  "My younger brother's death in Vietnam was both sobering and cause for reflection. In 'Fallen Angels' I wanted to dispel the notion of war as either romantic or simplistically heroic.": "Walter",
  "I'm a big romantic, traditional, cheesy guy.": "Josh",
  "Think back to yourself at age 18. I know I was mighty different than the Patti I am today. As we grow up, we grow out of our haircuts, our apartments and - often times - our romantic decisions.": "Patti",
  "I've done five films directed by women. I did like it. They had qualities, particularly in the romantic tenderness of scenes. I felt sometimes they were a little bit soft, but maybe they were clever to get the guys working the way they wanted them to.": "Jacqueline",
  "My goal on my bucket list is to write a romantic comedy movie.": "Lynda",
  "'Bombay Velvet' is my most romantic film, it's my 'Titanic' or 'Gone With The Wind.'": "Ranbir",
  "I would say 80% of the scripts I get are dramas and not comedies or romantic comedies, which is funny because that's what I do every week.": "Eva",
  "Anders Thomas Jensen and I had talked about making a movie which addressed the cancer issue, and we didn't want to make it heavy-handed. We wanted to do something which had a lot of hope in it. And then for some reason we came up with a romantic comedy.": "Susanne",
  "The romantic view would be that nomads are wonderful people, better than us; they care about the environment.": "Robyn",
  "NASA projects often have romantic names that link into a long history of exploration and adventure: Atlantis and Discovery, for example.": "Hanna",
  "I had a kind of romantic notion about being a Hollywood Errol Flynn type.": "Kelsey",
  "I believe that when you're in love you have to pour your heart and soul out to your partner... or why bother? So in that sense I'm an incurable romantic when it comes to men.": "Cameron",
  "There's something very romantic about self-destruction and sabotaging your life, and taking a hammer to it.": "Gerard",
  "I'm a fan of daytime drama; I totally get it. When we are doing scenes that are romantic or will get the audience riled up, I feel like I'm a fan in the room going, 'People are going to be so mad right now!'": "Alison",
  "Movies are romantic fantasies.": "Ira",
  "After a life deprived of everything from romantic love to the choice of when to wake up in the morning, after 29 years without the ability to have a career or even to be alone at toilet, the Bijani sisters are not symbols but women who have had to live a shared life of constant, quotidian sacrifice.": "Darin",
  "I'm not the most romantic guy, although I do try.": "Seth",
  "I was meant to date the captain of the football team, I was going to be on a romantic excursion every Saturday night, I was destined to be collecting corsages from every boy in town before prom, accepting such floral offerings like competing sacrifices to a Delphic goddess.": "Elizabeth",
  "My wife was the first romantic partner who understood both American and native parts of me - not so much the positive stuff, but the damage.": "Sherman",
  "Sometimes I make very selfish choices; like I did 'Once Upon A Time' for my inner 8-year-old and my hypothetical future child. I've done some movies because I would regret them if I didn't, but other projects I've done because they've scared me or if I felt I needed to do a big romantic comedy to help me professionally.": "Ginnifer",
  "I've always been sort of addicted to genre-jumping. I've never been in the mood to do the same thing I did last time. Hence, me going from 'Big Love' to romantic comedy, to period film... I can't sit still.": "Ginnifer",
  "I could go my whole life and say, 'I'm not going to do anything with a love triangle,' but whenever you have a romance, there has to be some obstacle, and even the dumbest romantic comedies have a love triangle or something.": "Catherine",
  "German accents and Hassidic accents aren't that romantic. They're more harsh. Although Hebrew, when spoken by certain people, sounds beautiful. There's this beautiful woman I know who speaks Hebrew, and when she speaks, it's so attractive. Maybe it's who's speaking it.": "Janeane",
  "I go to Saint Barth in the French West Indies for two weeks each year. That place is amazing. Amazing people, beautiful beaches, great wine, wonderful harbors... It's incredibly romantic.": "Brooke",
  "Latin men are the most passionate men in the world - they may not be the most aggressive, but they are very passionate, very romantic.": "Brooke",
  "I don't know about the romantic comedy route, although never say never.": "Kristen",
  "I don't believe in having one partner for your whole life, but I hope I get married. I want to have a husband and two kids and a nice little life baking pies. I'm quite romantic. It's definitely important to have someone make you feel special.": "Hilary",
  "I'm turned off by the groupie thing. I'm a romantic; I like finding the right woman, and if it works, it works.": "Joe",
  "I'd like to do a romantic comedy like 'Notting Hill,' which is one of my favorite movies.": "Rutina",
  "The romantic embrace can only be compared with music and with prayer.": "Havelock",
  "I have a romantic side.": "Curtis",
  "I would have loved to do 'Alice in Wonderland.' Being a 'Bond' girl would always be fun. We had a lot of action in 'Eclipse' and I'd definitely like to continue down the action road. I want to do a romantic period piece, but those are really hard to get made because they're very expensive and there's not a huge demographic.": "Ashley",
  "I would have loved to do romantic comedies. That's what I think I would be best at.": "Rene",
  "I don't ever want to be a sentimentalist. I prefer to be a realist. I'm not a romantic really.": "James",
  "Acting is not about anything romantic, not even fantasy, although you do create fantasy.": "James",
  "I'm a street photographer, but I'm interested in any ironic, whimsical images, and there's something very romantic about a circus.": "Mary",
  "When I was about 14 I remember thinking when it came to proposing to my future girlfriend, I'd make a CD with all her favourite songs and a message that said, 'Will you marry me?' Shows you what a romantic I was. No one listens to CDs any more. It's all about iTunes.": "Tinie",
  "The Romantic poets were the prototype ramblers, and I've often found myself following in their footsteps - although perhaps not all of their footsteps since a typical walk for Samuel T. Coleridge might last two days and cover 145km.": "Arthur",
  "I lived by the candlelight for two years because I couldn't afford power. It was nice and romantic at the time, but if you can't afford power you're pretty broke. You endure it.": "Jeremy",
  "The most romantic thing a guy has ever done for me is starting a family. That's as romantic as it gets.": "Isla",
  "I am a hopeless romantic, and so is my wife.": "Nick",
  "I want to do action, romantic comedy, and I love drama.": "Liya",
  "I would love to do a romantic comedy - a good one.": "Stephanie",
  "I think opera has gained a kind of glamorous appeal. It's a live performance that aligns all of the arts, and when it is represented in the media, in film in particular, it is presented as something that is really a special event, whether it's a great date or something that's just hugely romantic.": "Renee",
  "It's good to be able to be a leading lady, to be a romantic lead, to play opposite people who are talented, and charismatic and stuff.": "Heather",
  "Kim Kardashian's marriage to Kris Humphries famously lasted 72 days, and was reported in the tabloids as being all about the big bucks paid by magazines for the bridal photos: it is a spectacle of a bride-to-be as entrepreneur, not as romantic heroine; the groom, in this scenario, is nothing but a prop.": "Naomi",
  "I think that the romantic impulse is in all of us and that sometimes we live it for a short time, but it's not part of a sensible way of living. It's a heroic path and it generally ends dangerously.": "Jane",
  "It's been such a deep and amazing journey for me, getting close to John Keats, and also I love Shelley and Byron. I mean, the thing about the Romantic poets is that they've got the epitaph of romantic posthumously. They all died really young, and Keats, the youngest of them all.": "Jane",
  "There is a romantic, often misguided, misconception among the British that life in France is akin to life in Paradise.": "Janine",
  "I'm a hopeless 19th-century romantic.": "John",
  "People expect me to be dark and gloomy, then write that I'm a jolly chap, and after all, that is what I am. I think it's a case of an absolute romantic naivety that there should be a parallel between the work and the artist.": "Michael",
  "I'm not a social singer. But if one can take a social message via the romantic, that's a strong statement.": "Luis",
  "In my player, I have a Luis Miguel CD as well as a Brian McKnight CD. I'm known for my very romantic ballads as well as the fun, up-tempo pop songs.": "Luis",
  "The genre I listen to the most is salsa, so people look at me and see this guy who's done mostly romantic ballads, but there's always been this other side.": "Luis",
  "Usually, in romantic comedies, you end up sacrificing a great deal of the complexity - you know, just two attractive people and a good soundtrack.": "Timothy",
  "'Romeo And Juliet' is the classic love story. When two lovers are separated and trying to get back to one another, that's fiercely romantic and something you become glued to.": "Saoirse",
  "I have nothing against romance. I believe that we must hold on to the right to dream and to be romantic. But an Indian village is not something that I would romanticize that easily.": "Arundhati",
  "Love alone could waken love.": "Pearl",
  "It was a romantic dream to be a writer. It seemed like a calling.": "Bobbie",
  "I'm very romantic, I'm extremely romantic. I date my wife.": "Alice",
  "When I started, there was something almost romantic about the notion of paparazzi. I mean, it wasn't. They were still chasing you down the road. But that guy had to put film in his camera and work out whether it was worth pressing the button to take the shot, otherwise he's got to stop and change the film. So it was like this age of innocence.": "Kylie",
  "I sang everything - R&B slow jams, Spanish slow jams, romantic reggaeton - and I really didn't care which I got signed for.": "Prince",
  "I feel like I've done a bunch of period stuff and then a bunch of romantic comedies.": "Kate",
  "When I was pregnant, I had the romantic idea that after the baby was born I would not only take up reading in earnest again, but also write a novel while my daughter slept in her Moses basket. Of course, I barely had time to keep up with my magazines until she started sleeping properly.": "Kate",
  "I've heard stories about movies that are really maybe difficult and really dramatic and good, but they are being sold as romantic comedies. All it's going to do is just... that's hurting the work, because that just makes it impossible for anyone to see it correctly.": "Shane",
  "The only thing I can ever do is make a film that I can respond to. I could not make a romantic comedy for college girls. I wouldn't know how that works.": "Shane",
  "Romantic relationships are the least interesting thing for me to write about. I'm 45, and that's not the most interesting thing in my life anymore.": "Kelly",
  "I think of OkCupid as an online bar; a place where singles can go, have fun with each other and in the process hopefully meet new people, some of whom might turn into a romantic relationship.": "Sam",
  "Judy Garland was a different type of entertainer. She was a dancer, a singer, and an incurable romantic.": "Mickey",
  "When I was a child, the temptation to sin was always a romantic option. This romantic option led me to the cinema, a place where sin was welcome.": "Harmony",
  "I love romantic comedies, or romantic dramas - basically anything with love in it.": "Rachel",
  "If I were given a choice between two films and one was dark and explored depraved, troubled or sick aspects of our culture, I would always opt for that over the next romantic comedy.": "David",
  "I'm not really interested in doing a traditional romantic comedy where everything ties up neatly.": "Leslie",
  "I would love to play the lead in a big romantic comedy. That's definitely a dream of mine.": "Rosamund",
  "Lidia Bastianich, sorry, but kind of boring. I mean, I love Lidia, but you can fall asleep watching her. And Mario Batali? I love Mario to death... but he's not romantic or sensual. Those are the things I bring to the table.": "Giada",
  "I've never felt that I had to take a role in one of those mediocre but hugely budgeted romantic comedies because I want to wear beautiful dresses and have people think I'm pretty and that I get the guy.": "Minnie",
  "If you don't know a lot about figure skating, it's easy to fall in love with ice dancing because it's so romantic and so theatrical.": "Dorothy",
  "Dinner is a great first date. Don't believe that stuff about girls not wanting to eat on a first date - sharing a romantic meal is so sexy.": "Carmen",
  "I'm very romantic.": "Carmen",
  "Classical and romantic: private language of a family quarrel, a dead dispute over the distribution of emphasis between man and nature.": "Cyril",
  "I happen to know there is nothing sexy or romantic about love scenes. They are just awful to do.": "Keeley",

  "I was married when I was 17. I knew nothing. I was full of romance.": "Gloria",
  "I don't know if it's possible to live the rock 'n roll lifestyle and still be romantic.": "Adam",
  "I think that there is always a part of utopia in any romantic relationship.": "Pedro",
  "I did want a boy child because I had this romantic idea that a boy child when he's 16 takes his mother out for dinner.": "Jennifer",
  "Back in the mid '90s, I went to a film festival, and they were airing 'Central Park West' at the same time as this cute little romantic comedy movie called 'French Exit,' and I got to go from one theater where I was goofy, falling over myself, to this kind of evil vixen kind of character.": "Madchen",
  "There's something about marriage that is not as intensely romantic or interesting as a couple's first meeting.": "John",
  "I like all types of women. I accept them as they are when they come into my life... But I'm not a romantic. I'm just up-front. I like to be a part of something real, not make-believe. I tell women to tell me the truth, to just lay it out. Let me be the judge and decide if I want you around or not. Let me have my choice.": "Nayvadius",
  "I am very lucky. I have known wonderful romantic love in my life but to actually see this little creature and find him to be the most beautiful creature in the world. I know all mothers and fathers feel that way.": "Anne-Marie",
  "I can't remember a time when I didn't want to be a reporter. I don't know where I got the idea that it was a romantic calling.": "Charles",
  "Now that I look back on it, having retired from being a reporter, it was kind of romantic. It was a wonderful way to live one's life, just as I imagined it would be when I was 6 or 7.": "Charles",
  "A handful of older, romantic leading men, like Sean Connery, Jack Nicholson, and Robert Redford are still landing parts.": "Charles",
  "I'm a romantic.": "Tom",
  "I'm not really a believer in romantic, happily-ever-after love stories.": "Richard",
  "The romantic idea is that everybody around a writer must suffer for his talent. I think a writer is a citizen of humanity, part of his nation, part of his family. He may have to make some compromises.": "Irwin",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic.": "Lance",
  "Cooking is always very romantic!": "Matthew",
  "No highbrow literary type would ever say 'Moby Dick' is good but it's just about a whale, or a Jane Austen would be important if she wasn't just writing about romantic relationships.": "Sophie",
  "If I can be my crazy, wild self in front of a person, and he still likes me, that's romantic.": "Preity",
  "Wine writers have been around for almost as long as there has been wine, but in the past, generally speaking, most wine writing was uncritical and emphasized wine as a romantic, historic beverage. Criticism and comparative tastings were eschewed for fear of offending the trade, which most writers depended upon for survival.": "Robert",
  "I'm probably the furthest from being romantic that you've ever seen I'm not even close to being romantic in any way until I have to be. ": "Brian",
  "For the longest time, I didn't even want to admit I was serious about music. Before the Shins, I would tell myself, 'Oh, I'm going to figure something out someday.' I had this romantic vision of being this old dude maybe making guitars or something.": "James",
  "If I can do a romantic comedy with women, that's Everest to me.": "Joe",
  "I came across 'The Song of Achilles' by Madeline Miller in one of the most romantic ways one can find a story. I was digging through a pile of used books at my local library when my hand gravitated toward its brilliant teal and glistening gold cover.": "Taylor",
  "The city of Oia is the most magnificently romantic place I've ever been.": "Lisa",
  "I don't want to be Mr. Romantic Leading Man. I don't want to be the Dance Dude. I don't want to be the Action Guy. If I had to do any one of those all my life, it'd drive me crazy.": "Patrick",
  "I'm the first one who sees every romantic comedy in theaters.": "Elizabeth",
  "My music is bejewelled, it's colourful, it's romantic, it shines.": "Carly",
  "I have to be asked, I guess, but I love the idea of marriage. I think it's beautiful. I'm such a romantic, and I always have been.": "Portia",
  "I'm still a bit of a romantic and an idealist and hopelessly naive.": "Brit",
  "Well, there's just some universal truths in a way that I've just observed to be true. You read Voltaire. You read modern literature. Anywhere you go, there's these observations about romantic love and what it does people, and these rotten feelings that rarely are people meaning to do that to each other.": "Feist",
  "My personal style changes wherever I am. When I'm in Ibiza, I'm a bit girlier because there's an opportunity to be more romantic and dress up for the beach scene. Whereas in New York, I tend to go for suiting and tailoring that almost feels like weaponry for the city - but I think I'm quite playful no matter what.": "Jade",
  "We watch a romantic comedy because we want to cry, say, or an action movie so we can participate in heroics. Horror's different. It can hit you with a moment of revulsion so hard you might want to erase the last five minutes of your life, please.": "Stephen",
  "My mom had this romantic notion of her children playing classical music. The idea is you learn it when you're still learning language. It's using the same part of the brain.": "Andrew",
  "I don't want to, in any way, characterize a race or a people or get accused of racial profiling, but the Irish, as lyrical and romantic as they can be in their poetry, they can be every bit as repressed in their personal relations.": "Stephen",
  "When you have kids and get older, it goes beyond flowers and chocolate. It's about waking up with a baby, letting her sleep in, and making a coffee for her when she wakes up. To me, being romantic is putting someone else first and thinking about what makes them happy.": "James",
  "My sister's journal was the romantic one with boys, and mine was talking about my rock tumbler. We were so different and so similar.": "Paula",
  "In terms of romantic films, all-time romantic films, I really like 'Gone With the Wind.' And I realize I sound so cliched saying that, but there's something so absolutely romantic about it.": "Freida",
  "I've flown across America, I've scaled fences, I've stood under windows and gone out of my way hundreds of times. I'm a hopeless romantic. There's no hope for me.": "Joel",
  "In mainstream romantic comedies, I'm usually tearing my hair out. It's just a devastatingly difficult genre for me.": "Carter",
  "Many times an actor is stuck for the lack of choices. The same happened with me when I started my career. That was the time when mainly romantic films were being made, and that is what I was offered all the time.": "Arjun",
  "I think it's easy to hold on to this romantic hope that communities such as Niaqornat won't change, because we're in this world where progress is unstoppable, and they're a link to some idealised past.": "Sarah",
  "It was a time after 'Lady Sings the Blues' and 'Mahogany' and all those romantic movies: I became this romantic figure on the street in a very special way.": "Billy",
  "I did something that no brown-skinned man in the movie industry ever did. I made a brown-skinned man look very romantic - a matinee idol. If you think about it, what I introduced is historical because it had never happened before, and it hasn't happened since - not on that level.": "Billy",
  "Mind you, Roman Holiday - which is kind of a romantic comedy - is one of my favorite films, and I think Audrey Hepburn is absolutely phenomenal in that movie.": "Ellen",
  "I've always loved the language of flowers. I discovered Kate Greenaway's 'Language of Flowers' in a used bookstore when I was 16 and couldn't believe it was such a well-kept secret. How could something so beautiful and romantic be virtually unknown?": "Vanessa",
  "The whole romantic part of my life was a wipeout. I didn't even own a belt.": "Paul",
  "More generally, I made an effort to leave out things that weren't relevant to the main narrative themes of the book, namely that there were two sides to Steve Jobs: the romantic, poetic, countercultural rebel on one side, and the serious businessperson on the other.": "Walter",
  "I'm a really huge fan of the old romantic comedies from the '30s and '40s... Huge fan. I love all that stuff.": "Thomas",
  "I usually decide if I'm going to do a movie based on if I like the script or not. I thought 'Pulling Strings' had every single element that a classic romantic comedy needs to be a success. It's very well written. The cast was amazing. It was a decision I made based on the power of the script.": "Jaime",
  "Perhaps I've been perceived more as a romantic comedy actor, but overall, I enjoy acting in any shape or form.": "Jaime",
  "It's so interesting that the romantic side of my life comes from my father, who I really didn't even know that well.": "Sophie",
  "I have a great wife and it's very easy to be romantic because it makes her happy and then my life is so much better when she's happy.": "Nicholas",
  "The chance to play a romantic character who kisses somebody onscreen was one of the elements that made me want to do 'The Stand.' The more you can do, the better, and I've been known as a character actor.": "Gary",
  "I try to do romantic gestures all the time.": "Armie",
  "In a romantic comedy, it's usually a good idea to have people who can't stand the fact that they are attracted to each other.": "Amanda",
  "I don't live with people, that's why my relationships last. I'm not romantic. Even when I was a teenager if somebody asked if they could hold my hand I'd say, - no, it's not heavy, I can hold it myself, thank you'.": "Paul",
  "I did a film called 'Puccini for Beginners,' which was a romantic comedy, and I always wanted to do more, but I kept doing drama.": "Elizabeth",
  "Maybe I don't see enough television, but it seems there aren't many shows that are romantic comedies that are an hour long where you're not solving a crime or being a doctor.": "Elizabeth",
  "I'm probably a bit romantic about it, but I think we humans miss having contact with fire. We need it.": "Jamie",
  "In those days, boxing was very glamorous and romantic. You listened to fights on the radio, and a good announcer made it seem like a contest between gladiators.": "Joseph",
  "I'm a big old romantic.": "Colin",
  "Yeah, but there's nobody who represents romance to me like Cary Grant.": "Aaron",
  "I'm a very romantic person.": "Esai",
  "I'd like to do a romantic comedy.": "Aaron",
  "I think the best romantic comedies don't have villains.": "Nicholas",
  "I knew after 'Sarah Marshall' that my favorite genre is romantic comedy. Nothing is more satisfying than a great romantic comedy.": "Nicholas",
  "I'm a romantic you have to be to marry four times. ": "Jay",
  "To be a lone filmmaker thousands of miles from home with nobody believing in me, that seems romantic.": "Doug",
  "A good romantic comedy is my favorite movie to watch.": "Nicholas",
  "I think the best romantic comedies are hard funny - no soft jokes, but ones that make you, like, guffaw. I also think that they have to make you feel good, ideally, and make you feel warm inside at the end.": "Nicholas",
  "I don't like high concept movies very much, and the kind of scripts that I would occasionally get offered tended to be really high concept comedies or romantic comedies. I just don't like it. I like much more realistic movies with actual psychology and behavior in them.": "Greg",
  "My dad is Scottish, and he read in the newspaper about the plight of the Scottish Freshwater Mussel, which is a real thing - like, a very real, serious conservation issue. And he's a writer, and he was going to do a film about a Glaswegian gangster, and then I stole the idea and turned it into a romantic comedy.": "Talulah",
  "For a romantic comedy to be three hours long, that's longer than most marriages.": "David",
  "The most aggressive artists often hide their romantic side.": "Don",
  "I love being one half of a romantic couple.": "Julianna",
  "I'm a horrible romantic!": "Jamie",
  "I'm really not a TV junkie... OK, I kind of am a TV junkie, but I'm much more of a movie junkie - my junk food is romantic comedies I've seen a million times.": "Alison",
  "I don't think I'll ever escape the fact that I don't belong anywhere in particular. I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.": "Hugo",
  "I've often dreamed about going back to Nigeria, but that's a very romantic notion. It's a hideous country to go to in reality.": "Hugo",
  "With female-oriented movies, unless it's something like 'Bridesmaids' or a romantic comedy, you've got to really worry about your opening weekend. And I'm always telling stories about women, not younger women, and it's just a much tougher audience to get to the movie theater.": "Callie",
  "I'm more likely to give you a cuddle than a punch in the face. I have a soft side, especially with my girlfriend. I send her flowers and use my culinary skills to pull off romantic meals. I do great Thai dishes.": "Jai",
  "America to me is so varied and exciting. I always feel nostalgia for the place I'm not in, and then I get there and find myself in a traffic jam going into the Lincoln Tunnel, and I think, 'God, why was I romanticizing this part of the country?' I think it has to do with the romantic, unrealistic temperament.": "Ian",
  "I'd like to classify my life as a romantic comedy. Unfortunately I feel it's probably more like a TV reality show.": "Uma",
  "I always like to read something romantic about the place I'm visiting.": "Anouska",
  "When I'm with the wife, and we're having a romantic night, I occasionally think about a glass of red wine, but I'll order a sparkling water. I'd like the wine, but it wouldn't end with one glass, so I don't even go there.": "Dave",
  "But romantic vision can also lead one away from certain very hard, ugly truths about life that are important to know.": "Donna",
  "I'm a romantic, and I like guys to bring flowers and buy some gifts - not expensive things, just romantic things.": "Bai",
  "When you're playing a romantic version of a real person, you're playing a version of the truth.": "Andrea",
  "I wouldn't treat a romantic scene any differently than any other scene. I would really say the biggest preparation was chewing gum and breath mints! For a kissing scene, it's all about the breath mints!": "Alice",
  "I seem to be drawn to the really romantic songs.": "Vonda",
  "Love is the driver for all great stories: not just romantic love, but the love of parent for child, for family, for country.": "Jojo",
  "I don't want to be pigeonholed into doing just romantic comedies. But they're fun, and especially for women, it's nice to go to see them and enjoy that breath of fresh air.": "Kristen",
  "I think that sometimes, romantic comedies have to be really broad, and that the plot of people falling in and out of love or whatever is not enough. 'Enough Said' had that stuff, but I wanted it to be fun and funny while also grounded in reality.": "Nicole",
  "Assume everything you put on the Internet can and will be seen not only by the person you're talking about, but your future romantic partners and bosses, too.": "Mara",
  "Full-blooded romantic love I wouldn't be able to write about.": "Alan",
  "It kind of sounds pretentious, but a film I find deeply romantic is 'Buffalo '66,' which is a film by Vincent Gallo. It's about how you break down all those barriers and expose yourself and open yourself up to ultimately being hurt.": "Jim",
  "I'd always been quite wary of doing a romantic comedy. They all seem the same to me.": "Jim",
  "Yeah, romantic comedies are the hardest movies to make. Maybe one works a year.": "Dylan",
  "I think there are certain tenets set in place for all different types on genres. For thrillers, women usually die first. I can't say exactly why, and it's kind of a bummer... But I also can't explain why the wallflower girl in the romantic comedy always gets the guy in the end. That's just the way those movies go.": "Katie",
  "I'm not about to talk about what's romantic in my life - I figure if you talk about it once - then that's an open invitation for everyone to dig into your personal life even further.": "James",
  "Being in the studio is a really romantic time.": "Alison",
  "My great-grandfather was in the army in India, and we have photographs of my family there in full Victorian dress. They're incredibly romantic.": "Georgina",
  "I'm not about to talk about what's romantic in my life - I figure if you talk about it once, then that's an open invitation for everyone to dig into your personal life even further. So, I just keep my private life to myself.": "James",
  "I'd like to be the romantic lead one day, but I've got to grow my hair first.": "Vinnie",
  "There are so many romantic comedies made, but very few dramas or love stories. And with a love story, you have to take time to develop three-dimensional characters.": "Gina",
  "'Not Another Happy Ending' is a romantic comedy starring Karen Gillan and Stanley Weber. It is about these two characters and their relationships.": "Henry",
  "I like romantic comedies, as it is a fun and light thing to get involved with.": "Henry",
  "The concept of romantic love affords a means of emotional manipulation which the male is free to exploit, since love is the only circumstance in which the female is (ideologically) pardoned for sexual activity.": "Kate",
  "When you are the lead in a romantic comedy, you have to worry about people really liking you.": "Morris",
  "I am a big fan of the old Howard Hawks films from the 30s and 40s, I was a big Hepburn and Tracey fan for a while and Woody Allen films that are a very different kind of romantic comedy.": "Edward",
  "My vanity is I'm terribly romantic! But being married is lovely.": "Matthew",
  "The essence of romantic love is that wonderful beginning, after which sadness and impossibility may become the rule.": "Anita",
  "I love romantic comedy, but I think you have to have another idea that you're chasing along with romantic comedy.": "James",
  "No, actually 'The Host' was totally a palate-cleanser for me. I wanted to do something a little bit different than romantic love. Romantic love is in there, obviously, because I enjoy writing about that and living it a lot.": "Stephenie",
  "I'm in the mood for another Moonstruck experience, for another romantic comedy.": "Norman",
  "Moonstruck... was one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.": "Norman",
  "And even Moonstruck - for some reason the audience were just in the mood for a very romantic film, because it's one of the few romantic comedies to be nominated for a Best Picture Oscar.": "Norman",
  "New York has got this sort of wonderful romantic idea of the South.": "Josh",
  "I think the institute of marriage is a noble thing. The idea of a partner for life is incredibly romantic. But now we're living to 100. A hundred years ago people were dying at age 37. Til death do us part was a much different deal.": "Debra",
  "It more or less has the shape of a love song, but 'Crescent Moon' reflects more my longing for an ancient romantic context that includes wild animals, fire, danger of death, stellar navigation, and seasonal intuition.": "Frank",
  "I'm not the girl that sits at home on a Saturday night plaiting her girlfriend's hair, drinking tea and watching romantic comedies.": "Ricki-Lee",
  "I need to be more romantic. I do. I know that's something women really appreciate.": "Brody",
  "'Perfect Sense' is a film about love and catastrophe, which I hope is a powerfully romantic and emotional take on the apocalyptic sub-genre. Its aim is to be a minimalist concept movie - where seismic events occur in simple ways that ask the audience to use their imagination.": "David",
  "I was a huge fan of the bandleader Ray Noble when I was younger. He was one of the biggest musical names of his day and wrote such romantic songs as 'Goodnight Sweetheart' and 'The Touch Of Your Lips.' Wonderful stuff.": "June",
  "You're always close and you never get that big romantic lead.": "Patricia",
  "I had a lot of romantic notions about what it would mean to cross Asia by foot.": "Rory",
  "In some sense, I'm a romantic. I like the idea of organic history and tradition.": "Rory",
  "I was the female lead in a romantic comedy. It's a little indie film that we shot in China called 'America Town,' starring Daniel Henney and Bill Paxton. I actually had to speak Chinese in the film. It was funny because I found out I was doing the film and then a week later, I was in Shanghai.": "Eliza",
  "I love Billy Wilder, and I love the way that his films can be very touching and very moving and very romantic, and at the same time there's always a little cynical undertone, there's always something that undercuts things.": "David",
  "It'll be interesting to see if I ever have to play a typical, bland romantic interest. I'm quirky, and playing it kind of straight and bland doesn't interest me a whole lot.": "Matt",
  "I really love the idea of the poetically mad - the character that is imbued with the romantic madness. Like River from 'Firefly' or Drusilla from 'Buffy.' Someone dangerously unhinged, where you're really not sure they're going to be reliable minute-to-minute.": "Holly",
  "We shouldn't romanticize rejection. There's nothing romantic about rejection. It's horrible.": "Marlon",
  "A romantic is someone who believes that something is valuable even if it doesn't last. And a non-romantic is someone who says that if something doesn't endure, or can't be logically proved and pinned down, it's worthless.": "Sebastian",
  "For me, the romantic comedies I love are the ones that pay homage to the genre, but also find their ways to twist it and tweak it.": "Greg",
  "The Southern whites are in many respects a great people. Looked at from a certain point of view, they are picturesque. If one will put oneself in a romantic frame of mind, one can admire their notions of chivalry and bravery and justice.": "James",
  "I am a romantic, in a literary way, by which I mean the Romantic poets, who thought just because a sensation is fleeting doesn't mean it isn't valuable. If the only criterion of value is whether something lasts, then the whole of human life is a waste of time.": "Sebastian",
  "Then I abandoned comics for fine art because I had some romantic vision of being like Vincent Van Gogh Jr.": "Bill",
  "I was commissioned to write some romantic fiction, and I really liked doing those, and they were very instructive in terms of building characters and plots. But it never felt right for me.": "Paula",
  "When I read the script, I liked the script very much and I thought it was a marvelous part for her, because I think it is a change of pace. I mean, we know how wonderful she is in romantic comedy.": "Albert",
  "I think if you're going to be committed to doing anything, you really have to care about it, and I suppose that is a romantic idea.": "Tony",
  "Therapy was the biggest romance of my life.": "Dar",
  "I got a gymnastics scholarship to college, fell in love with my true love of my whole life - who I'm married to now - and he was a virgin too. It was very romantic.": "Victoria",
  "'I Am Number Four' is an action-packed adventure entwined with a romantic story. I play the role of John Smith. John wants to be a normal kid, but he is from a different planet and he has been given this destiny of becoming a warrior.": "Alex",
  "I don't want to do romantic roles where I have to lip sync to a song. A role that explores romance on a new level would suit me.": "Irrfan",
  "When you see a bad romantic comedy, you see the script, the director, and the actors trying to create this warmth and this pathos and this feeling that you care about them. That cannot be manufactured - it's either there or it isn't.": "Jeff",
  "I love romantic films and love drama. Any film that has romance or romantic element is my comfort.": "Rani",
  "I think that baseball as a whole, I am a huge romantic when it comes to the history and the stats and the numbers the stories behind it, so I would consider myself a pretty big fan.": "Graham",
  "Well my biggest dream is to be in a romantic comedy.": "Izabella",
  "I've been married before, but I've never had my dream wedding in Vegas. I wanted to do it there because it's casual, quick, not religious and, most of all, very romantic.": "Sinead",
  "I sail, run dogs, ride horses, play professional poker and tell stories about the stuff I've been through. And I'm still a romantic; I still want Bambi to make it out of the fire.": "Gary",
  "I'm really a romantic at heart.": "Christopher",
  "I was a very romantic, overly dramatic young lady, which served me well as a songwriter. Especially as someone who had to focus on lyrics and melody, because if you're a dramatic and romantic person, lyrics come easy, and you turn every single short-term relationship into the biggest 'Romeo-and-Juliet' story ever.": "Jane",
  "I think as a filmmaker one should make all kinds of films. It is not that one should make only one kind of film. I love to see romantic films; I loved watching 'Dilwale Dulhaniya Le Jayenge,' 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai.' If I make such films, I will make it with my yardstick, according to my parameters.": "Madhur",
  "I don't need to control anything. Even with romantic partnerships, I don't need to control anyone.": "Cass",
  "I never sat down and said, 'I'm going to write historical fiction with strong romantic elements.' It was just the way the stories went.": "Lauren",
  "Say what you will about Queen Eleanor, she was a savvy, quick-witted woman who made her mark on history. And as the founder of the Courts of Love, what better patron monarch could there be for a romantic novelist?": "Lauren",
  "Get this, kids - how a man proposes isn't what makes him romantic. It's how a man purposes to lay down his life that makes him romantic.": "Ann",
  "Being a black woman, there's so many different sides of us. We are funny, silly, romantic, professional, smart, and we have good jobs.": "Lauren",
  "The most successful marriages, gay or straight, even if they begin in romantic love, often become friendships. It's the ones that become the friendships that last.": "Andrew",
  "I watch 'The Notebook.' I love romantic movies. I love romantic comedies.": "Romeo",
  "I don't like the way recording to digital sounds. Most of the time, when I'm recording to two-inch tape, I still have a romantic vision of how songs sounded coming out of the radio when I was younger, and how they sounded coming out of my little four-track cassette player.": "M.",
  "When I watch a romantic comedy, I feel like they're selling something that doesn't exist. Two beautiful, but extremely unpleasant, people are terrible to each other for an hour, accidentally kiss, then decide to like each other during an extremely vague montage. That isn't how people fall in love.": "Rainbow",
  "It's very difficult, I think, especially on two cellphones, to have a romantic conversation.": "Rainbow",
  "Well, we all start thinking we're going to be Romantic rock stars, but then reality hits and you realize no one reads you but other poets.": "George",
  "I'm sick of playing romantic leads.": "John",
  "I get a lot of dramas, but I'd like to do a romantic comedy type of movie; that'd be a nice step for me. No more screaming or running or shooting... for one movie where I can just be in love with a boy.": "Serinda",
  "I'm looking forward to sproglets but, as I'm the main breadwinner, I feel I ought to capitalise on my career for a bit longer. Mother keeps telling me I should go and freeze some eggs. Not terribly romantic, is it?": "Honeysuckle",
  "I've written a couple of scripts. Actually, a pilot. I'm not sure I'm allowed to say, but it's a comedy about three young men in New York City, one of whom may or may not be a romantic like me.": "Andre",
  "I'm the old-school, letter-writing romantic. I know it's out of style, and not a lot of women go for that these days, but that's what I go for.": "Andre",
  "The romantic appeal of solar sailing has ensured that its advocates consistently come from the worlds of both science fiction and science fact.": "Thomas",
  "It's the pursuit of love and happiness that is the driving force of the romantic novel.": "Susanna",
  "When you say that you write romantic fiction, there are a lot of people who have an image in their mind of the 'bodice ripper.' It's the one term that most romantic fiction writers absolutely hate because it has no bearing on what people are writing.": "Susanna",
  "Romantic fiction, in the broader sense, can be any novel that has a love story somewhere in it. It can be a mystery or a historical novel, as long as it has this very strong romantic thread running through it.": "Susanna",
  "Yes, I wrote songs. I was becoming kind of an Enrique Iglesias kind of a singer, with those ballads and cheesy romantic things.": "Juan",
  "Boys have said in the past that I live my life like a movie. I love all things romantic, like kissing in the rain.": "Mollie",
  "I have never been so calculating as to sing some Barry White song to get a girl. But I do think it's very romantic to cook dinner and sit around the piano at night and sing together.": "John",
  "Romantic lovers require from each other at least the facade of reason: We desire to be what romantic love makes us appear in the other's eyes. We want to imagine we are deserving of the love we inspire.": "Maggie",
  "Well, I think first it was rare for me to do anything that had any kind of a romantic note to it.": "Tim",
  "As an actor, I've grown considerably. It's taken me years to get comfortable doing a romantic scene and dancing on stage in front of a live audience. I've really opened up a lot.": "Sanjay",
  "I bought a selection of short, romantic fiction novels, studied them, decided that I had found a formula and then wrote a book that I figured was the perfect story. Thank goodness it was rejected.": "Louise",
  "As an actor, I've grown considerably. For example, it's taken me years to get comfortable doing a romantic scene and dancing on stage in front of a live audience. I do it a lot better than I ever did. I've really opened up a lot. And I'm glad I have because I'm being appreciated for it.": "Sanjay",
  "I don't know if it's a romantic comedy but I'm in the beginning of the first of the season of 'The West Wing.' We shot it last year. I don't know. If anyone asks me to be in one, I'll jump on it.": "Jason",
  "I couldn't write a happy movie or romantic comedy to save my life. Yes, Noel Coward's an idol, but his plays are serious to me. 'Private Lives' and 'Design for Living' both have an edge. Without psychoanalyzing myself, I think I exorcise my demons in my work.": "John",
  "I'm romantic to the point of embarrassment.": "Jesse",
  "In Romanticism, the main determinant is the mood, the atmosphere. And in that regard, you could also describe Schubert as a Romantic.": "Dietrich",
  "I don't think any of the early Romantic composers knew how to write for the piano... The music of that era is full of empty theatrical gestures, full of exhibitionism, and it has a worldly, hedonistic quality that simply turns me off.": "Glenn",
  "I'm a real romantic.": "Vanity",
  "The American is wholeheartedly for love and romance at any cost.": "Leslie",
  "I'm a dreadful romantic. No matter what I go through in life, I want to fall in love with a man.": "Rachel",
  "I feel so fortunate to have been able to work so much, particularly in the horror-thriller genre, but I would love to be able to do something perhaps a little more dramatic or even a romantic comedy.": "Danielle",
  "And I think maybe all women, if they just had a chance, would be romantic and believe in love and not sex. And men believe in sex and not love.": "Beatrice",
  "I'm sorry, but I can't make a movie with the blonde from 'ER' who is starring in every single bad romantic comedy.": "Matthew",
  "The thing you can't let go of is gravity. The reality of gravity in writing. If someone says something really mean in a sitcom, and the next wave isn't a reaction to the reality of that, you start losing relatability. In a lot of romantic comedies, they throw out the rules of life.": "Michael",
  "The big stars I felt a kinship with were never the romantic leads. It wasn't Steve McQueen or Robert Redford - it was people like Walter Matthau and Anthony Quinn. My big hero was Tommy Cooper.": "Alfred",
  "It is certainly true that writers take a stance at some variance from organized religion. This has not always been true. But since the romantic movement - and I'm referring now exclusively to poetry - the emphasis has been on the individual imagination defined against, rather than in terms of, any orthodoxy.": "Eavan",
  "I don't want to adhere to any particular image. I have tried to bring in variety to my characters. But then, only a few actors have managed to earn this tag of a romantic hero. Many have aspired to get such a label. So I am not complaining.": "Nivin",
  "I have been doing a lot of romantic movies, so such roles don't excite me much now. I would like to play an out-and-out, really cruel villain once. My character in 'Da Thadiya' had such a streak, but I want a full length villainous role. It is a different kind of excitement.": "Nivin",
  "All of the songs my grandparents and parents listened to are called boleros - they're all love songs. They're about giving your heart to a person. It's a culture that is so romantic and passionate, and that's something that I'm very proud of. We grew up with nothing, so we just want to live a life full of love.": "Camila",
  "I don't want to be romantic, but one of the most important things is to have happy buildings... it's like having a family with a lot of children.": "Renzo",
  "When I start to write, words have become physical presence. It was to see if I could bring that private world to life that found its first expression through reading. I really dislike the romantic notion of the artist.": "John",
  "If I loved all the world as I do you, I shouldn't write books to it: I should only write letters to it, and that would be only a clumsy stage on the way to entire telepathy.": "Laurence",
  "I hate to sound like a romantic adolescent, but I believe artists don't generally see art as a career choice; they simply can't overcome their desire to make art, and will live on little income for as long as they have to, before they start to sell their work - or give up and get a paying job.": "Charles",
  "People want to hear about the extremes of human nature. They want things that are larger than their own lives, and more romantic, and not necessarily of their own experiences.": "Richard",
  "I think in a lot of romantic comedies it ends with a kiss, and I feel like in modern day relationships, and maybe just my own experience, it starts with a kiss and then all sort of falls apart and then comes together. You're texting. You're wondering what's going on. There's no definitions, there's no labels.": "Elizabeth",
  "Women love romance, but they're not as romantic as men.": "George",
  "I went through a stage of writing my cramped hand in tiny books. My two sisters and I did have our Bronte period. My mum is from Yorkshire, and we would go up to the Moors. It tapped into our romantic visions of ourselves.": "Rachel",
  "Nobody's life is as romantic as it is in fiction.": "Ruth",
  "Elizabeth Taylor was an incurable romantic at heart. She never gave up on the notion that a love strong enough to last a lifetime was waiting for her around the next corner.": "Teresa",
  "I'd love to continue my career in Hollywood - I'd love to do another action film, or a romantic comedy, or horror. I love horror films.": "Rain",
  "We travellers are in very hard circumstances. If we say nothing but what has been said before us, we are dull and have observed nothing. If we tell anything new, we are laughed at as fabulous and romantic.": "Mary",
  "I love to make songs out of some of those shadows - you know, some of the things you lie awake thinking about, social anxieties and romantic insecurities and all that stuff.": "Matt",
  "A lot of the scripts I read and the characters I get are 'the girl' in romantic films, and I don't know how comfortable I am, or the world is, with me being that.": "Mamie",
  "One of the pitfalls of a romantic comedy is that you know how it's going to end.": "Jason",
  "I never got the opportunity to be romantic or feel romantic with anyone.": "Gary",
  "I am a pretty emotional person. Any act of kindness or unkindness moves me. When I see a romantic couple sitting by the beach, it moves me. I don't break down or crack under pressure, but I am just sensitive.": "Nimrat",
  "Basically, I'm a romantic.": "Pia",
  "I like to see love stories: romantic comedy or romantic drama.": "Pia",
  "When I was younger, many of my romantic escapades were just a means of simply avoiding being by myself. I was afraid of feeling lonely, afraid I wouldn't know what to say to myself.": "Michael",
  "I am a romantic, I admit it.": "Keith",
  "I'm drawn to the romantic aspect of a character. It's human emotion. It's much more fun to watch. And it's much more fun to play.": "Natalie",
  "I believe I can even yet remember when I saw the stars for the first time.": "Max",
  "'Little Night' has layers of meaning. There's something enchanted about night. All those heavenly bodies, shooting stars, the crescent moon, celestial phenomenon. Owls fly at night, and first kisses happen. Night is romantic. Alternately, darkness hides the worst of human behavior.": "Luanne",
  "It seemed romantic but also tragic - people would be winning but then lose it all, or crash but fight on, break bones but get back on their bikes and try to finish. Just getting to the end was seen as an achievement in itself.": "David",
  "Clearly romantic comedy is my franchise genre, I don't mind saying that, it's true. I love doing them and hopefully always will do them.": "Meg",
  "I enjoy doing romantic stories. I've done a lot of them.": "Joe",
  "I tend to play strong characters and people just assume that I would want to play romantic comedies, which I would love to do, but there are other women that do it so great and they maybe couldn't do what I do, play the kind of characters that I play.": "Carrie-Anne",
  "I'm all about making my girl feel like she's the only woman in the world. Whether it's telling her how special she is or showing her with gifts and romantic dates, I want to make her happy.": "Justin",
  "I like to swim a lot, while Stjepan likes to take long walks with girls. He's the very romantic type. Yes, musicians are romantic.": "Luka",
  "If you want to wear long hair or wear that dress, as long as you're not hurting yourself or anybody else, I say do it. If you want to go out and have a romantic, sexy affair, do it.": "Florence",
  "I'm not really a fan of Valentine's Day. I think it can be romantic doing nothing on Valentine's Day. It's more romantic than being given a big bunch of flowers that everyone else is doing.": "Gabriella",
  "The most romantic thing someone did was surprise me at the airport, after being away for 3 months in Los Angeles. You always see people with signs, and you're like, 'Isn't that lovely?' and then you see your own name on one - that isn't a taxi driver's! I was very impressed.": "Ophelia",
  "My husband does so many romantic things for me, it's absurd.": "Jennifer",
  "I think the French have a romantic cliche that Englishmen have great style, great music, irony and sense of humour. Well, sometimes cliches are true.": "Josephine",
  "If we perform the romantic repertoire we need more musicians.": "Neville",
  "My brother has a tendency to get quite lyrical when he writes music; he gets so romantic, it's borderline. I make it slightly more aggressive. I make the round corner a bit sharper.": "Josephine",
  "There are so many people I know who could be the greatest film-maker but who will never get the chance to make a movie it's all about what somebody is going to make back. There are not a lot of romantic ideas about making movies anymore. ": "Alexandra",
  "I think of making a movie in such a romantic way.": "Alexandra",
  "Romantic Orientalism was fascinated by the color and excitement of a powerful culture, and nearly always approached its subject with love.": "Kage",
  "I do feel like guys feel pressure to be funny with me, which is kind of annoying. It's a turn-off if someone's trying hard to be funny because it feels like they're auditioning for a comedy job or something. It doesn't feel romantic to me. I get so much comedy from my life that, from a guy, I'm more looking for something sweet or romantic.": "Chelsea",
  "I'm a hopeless romantic with a dirty mind.": "Leelee",
  "My mother was a reader; my father was a reader. Not anything particularly sophisticated. My mother read fat historical or romantic novels; my father liked to read Westerns, Zane Grey, that kind of stuff. Whatever they brought in, I read.": "John",
  "There are so many different reasons as to why I love riding trains. But I think ultimately it's the romantic feeling of it. There's something about it that just transports me into old films.": "Rosario",
  "Ever since the romantic comedy-drama 'She's Gotta Have It' antagonized black women and black men in 1986, Spike Lee's films have enjoyed the outrage of various groups.": "Lee",
  "In urban America, you do not so much meet a romantic partner as inherit the product of someone else's romantic crimes.": "Lee",
  "You're an actor, are you? Well, all that means is: you are irresponsible, irrational, romantic, and incapable of handling an adult emotion or a universal concept without first reducing it to something personal, material, sensational - and probably sexual!": "George",
  "I really, really, really want to do a silly romantic comedy where I can just have a crush on the guy, trip over myself, and laugh and be goofy. I just feel like all I do is cry, sob, and fight zombies and the bad guys.": "Laurie",
  "Before I became a suspense novelist, I wrote romantic suspense as Alicia Scott.": "Lisa",
  "I got a degree in sociology, didn't read much fiction in college, and I was a pretty political, left-wing type of guy. I wanted to do some kind of work in social change and make things better for the poor man, and I was very romantic and passionate about it.": "Andre",
  "As a young woman, I had been seeking experience, knowledge, truth, the stuff writers need in their work, but when the artist actually kicked in, I came to understand that in this romantic relationship I was not free to be myself, or to find myself, in order to begin the true work I needed to do.": "Taiye",
  "I just - I like the saccharin and the gooeyness of 'Bachelor,' and how just gross and like falsely romantic it is. Whereas, like, the 'Real Housewives' is just raw, and it's just - it's the fights that get me. It's just very uncomfortable for me.": "Ken",
  "I think the only thing that I really haven't done much in, and I haven't felt too attracted to, is romantic comedies.": "Marco",
  "To me, the most romantic gesture is a quiet night with my girl. I like to cook for her. I'm a meat eater and a griller - I do steaks, I do chicken, I do fish. I have a broad palate!": "Taylor",
  "I want to be romantic, and songs are a good way to do that.": "Tobias",
  "I just like being as romantic as possible. I thrive off unrequited love. I've been in love in one way or another since I was 14. I go full-on in and get obsessive.": "Tobias",
  "I've always loved the '40s romantic comedies and the idea of those mistaken identities and lovers' misunderstandings.": "Pearl",
  "I really love writing comedy. Writing romantic comedy is even nicer because you get to write about how insane we all act when we're falling in love.": "Pearl",
  "I would like to do maybe a smaller romantic comedy.": "Linda",
  "I got married in Florence, Italy. My husband and I were in love but totally broke, so we eloped and got married in Italy, where he was going on a business trip. We had to pull a guy off the street to be our witness. It was incredibly romantic. Florence is still one of my favorite cities in the world.": "Libba",
  "Historically, the French have had a romantic attachment to their bikes. Though the first functioning two-wheeler is thought to have been invented by a German in 1817, it was the French who popularized and marketed the device in the 1860s, giving it the name 'bicycle.'": "Elaine",
  "Jung Yong-hwa and I know so much about each other, I think it would be difficult for us to start a romantic relationship.": "Park",
  "I don't think that digital photography is romantic yet. It's not sympathetic the way that film is.": "Matthew",
  "The idea of being a novelist is really romantic, but it's kind of the same as being president of the United States - it's not gonna happen.": "Richard",
  "Originally, I thought English was more my home. But Spanish is so much more romantic. I've had to learn new phrases. I've had to learn to be more secure about singing in Spanish. But I'm working on it.": "La",
  "Hip hop is the strongest form of protest there is, and it doesn't always have to be a violent protest. It can be romantic, also. When you listen to Kanye West's 'Street Lights' for example, there's romance, there's pain - you feel the essence. I get the same thing from Drake and 2 Chainz.": "Giuseppe",
  "The phrase 'off with the crack of the bat', while romantic, is really meaningless, since the outfielder should be in motion long before he hears the sound of the ball meeting the bat.": "Joe",
  "I'm a romantic at heart.": "Tyler",
  "I'm a romantic. The impressionists have always been my favorites. I like prettiness - beauty, or what I perceive as beauty.": "Paul",
  "Although some people think I am a romantic novelist I have always thought of myself as a rather gritty radical historian.": "Philippa",
  "If I were sufficiently romantic I suppose I'd have killed myself long ago just to make people talk about me. I haven't even got the conviction to make a successful drunkard.": "John",
  "Something like 'Without a Paddle' does really well at the box office and I'm like, 'Oh, here we go.' In 'Without a Paddle' I'm the romantic lead - great! A comedy and that's what America wants. Then it did nothing for me and I went into kind-of a work abyss. I just didn't get another shot.": "Matthew",
  "But other vampire stories? Well, no, I really haven't read too many, and I can't say I'm crazy about romantic vampires anyway - to me the vampire is simply an evil monster.": "Brian",
  "Maybe I'm naively romantic, but I do believe that spice and excitement doesn't stop once a couple gets together.": "Stana",
  "Many people with physical disabilities have romantic lives and good marriages to partners who see past their disabilities and recognize all of the things they can do.": "Jeanne",
  "We 'chicks' have munched our popcorn while romantic comedies became just comedies, and then each female protagonist got recast for Matthew McConaughey or Seth Rogan.": "Emma",
  "I don't like to search too much. I find it is easier when romance finds you.": "Michelle",
  "Romance like a ghost escapes touching; it is always where you are not, not where you are. The interview or conversation was prose at the time, but it is poetry in the memory.": "George",
  "My idea of a romantic night is to watch action films.": "Corey",
  "I love the romance in Kimberly Derting's 'The Body Finder.' 'Cold Kiss' by Amy Garvey is unbelievably touching - and about so much more than just romantic love.": "Claudia",
  "I think we've always been fascinated with the idea of the romantic outlaw. John Gotti could be in one instance a charismatic, kind and loving family man, and in another, deadly to his enemies. The opportunity to tell the true story of Gotti with John Travolta is a director's dream.": "Joe",
  "Words of love, are works of love.": "William",
  "Too many women throw themselves into romance because they're afraid of being single, then start making compromises and losing their identity. I won't do that.": "Julie",
  "As a kid I quite fancied the romantic, Bohemian idea of being an artist. I expect I thought I could escape from the difficulties of maths and spelling. Maybe I thought I would avoid the judgement of the establishment.": "Peter",
  "Romance is mush, stifling those who strive.": "Billy",
  "Romantic heroes and heroines are a bit different from the sort of people we run into every day.": "Leigh",
  "In real love you want the other person's good. In romantic love you want the other person.": "Margaret",
  "Middle age is when a guy keeps turning off lights for economical rather than romantic reasons.": "Lillian",
  "'The Best Man' was my first feature film, and I didn't want to be known as a director who only does romantic comedies.": "Melissa",
  "The view which regards man as a well, a reservoir full of possibilities, I call the romantic; the one which regards him as a very finite and fixed creature, I call the classical.": "T.",
  "Forget romantic fiction, a survey has found that most women would rather read a good book than go shopping, have sex, or sleep.": "Janet",
  "Romance is dead - it was acquired in a hostile takeover by Hallmark and Disney, homogenized, and sold off piece by piece.": "Yeardley",
  "I think one of the downsides of the sort of obsession with romantic love and personal fulfillment is that the plain fact of the matter is that those feelings don't last for ever and so they better be replaced and reinforced by things that do.": "Mary",
  "I was born with a romantic nature, and I'll carry it to my grave.": "Telly",
  "There are two births: the one when light, First strikes the new awakened sense; The other when two souls unite, And we must count our life from thence, When you loved me and I loved you, Then both of us were born anew.": "William",
  "How people treat you is their karma how you react is yours. ": "Wayne",
  "When a woman is talking to you, listen to what she says with her eyes.": "Victor",
  "The relationship between husband and wife should be one of closest friends.": "B.",
  "I believe that two people are connected at the heart, and it doesn't matter what you do, or who you are or where you live; there are no boundaries or barriers if two people are destined to be together.": "Julia",
  "Never above you. Never below you. Always beside you.": "Walter",
  "More than half of people who leave their jobs do so because of their relationship with their boss. Smart companies make certain their managers know how to balance being professional with being human. These are the bosses who celebrate an employee's success, empathize with those going through hard times, and challenge people, even when it hurts.": "Travis",
  "Don't wait to be successful at some future point. Have a successful relationship with the present moment and be fully present in whatever you are doing. That is success.": "Eckhart",
  "No one can live without relationship. You may withdraw into the mountains, become a monk, a sannyasi, wander off into the desert by yourself, but you are related. You cannot escape from that absolute fact. You cannot exist in isolation.": "Jiddu",
  "Treasure your relationships, not your possessions.": "Anthony",
  "He who loves 50 people has 50 woes he who loves no one has no woes. ": "Buddha",
  "Relationships are eternal. The 'separation' is another chapter in the relationship. Often, letting go of the old form of the relationship becomes a lesson in pure love much deeper than any would have learned had the couple stayed together.": "Marianne",
  "Be honest, brutally honest. That is what's going to maintain relationships.": "Lauryn",
  "It's a complicated relationship with a guitar. I love the Bullet, for sure.": "Laurent",
  "Circumstance has no value. It is how one relates to a situation that has value. All true meaning resides in the personal relationship to a phenomenon... what it means to you.": "Christopher",
  "My relationship with my body has changed. I used to consider it as a servant who should obey, function, give pleasure. In sickness, you realise that you are not the boss. It is the other way around.": "Federico",
  "My relationship to plants becomes closer and closer. They make me quiet I like to be in their company. ": "Peter",
  "Distance is a bad excuse for not having a good relationship with somebody. It's the determination to keep it going or let it fall by the wayside that's the real reason that the relationships continue. ": "James",
  "Every man sees in his relatives, and especially in his cousins, a series of grotesque caricatures of himself.": "H.",
  "The thing that I think is the most important is taking moments to express your appreciation to your partner. A thank you or a quick kiss can go a long way toward affirming your relationship and commitment to each other. That's not hard to do even when you're juggling insane careers and three kids.": "Michael",
  "Once a woman has forgiven her man, she must not reheat his sins for breakfast.": "Marlene",
  "How can a woman be expected to be happy with a man who insists on treating her as if she were a perfectly normal human being.": "Oscar",
  "You never lose by loving. You always lose by holding back.": "Barbara",
  "Spirituality is not a formula it is not a test. It is a relationship. Spirituality is not about competency it is about intimacy. Spirituality is not about perfection it is about connection. The way of the spiritual life begins where we are now in the mess of our lives. ": "Mike",
  "I believe everyone has a soul mate that they can spend the rest of their life together.": "Ryan",
  "We have a relationship with our customer, and that relationship translates into sales.": "Richard",
  "A relationship can give you a gut wrenching feeling sometimes. It's a real emotional ride.": "Drake",
  "Everything is expressed through relationship. Colour can exist only through other colours, dimension through other dimensions, position through other positions that oppose them. That is why I regard relationship as the principal thing.": "Piet",
  "Who cares about the clouds when we're together? Just sing a song and bring the sunny weather.": "Dale",
  "It takes one person to forgive, it takes two people to be reunited.": "Lewis",
  "Love comes when manipulation stops when you think more about the other person than about his or her reactions to you. When you dare to reveal yourself fully. When you dare to be vulnerable. ": "Joyce",
  "You hear about quality time a lot but I really think that quantity time with a person is really what strengthens a relationship. That's when you really get to know somebody. You get to know their strengths and their weaknesses and that brings you closer. That's what 'Time Is Love' is all about.": "Josh",
  "Any relationship should have love, and if there is no love, it is better to call off a relationship. People say that love happens only once, but I don't believe in it because for me, if one relationship doesn't work, you should move on and seek love in another relationship. Who knows; you might find love in the second relationship.": "Bipasha",
  "A people's relationship to their heritage is the same as the relationship of a child to its mother.": "John",
  "Our first scene is sort of a reunion between the X-Men characters, which establishes everyone's relationship to one another, sort of like a recap for all those who have forgotten since the last movie.": "Shawn",
  "He who lives in our mind is near though he may actually be far away but he who is not in our heart is far though he may really be nearby. ": "Chanakya",
  "Every company has two organizational structures: The formal one is written on the charts the other is the everyday relationship of the men and women in the organization. ": "Harold",
  "All true meaning resides in the personal relationship to a phenomenon, what it means to you.": "Christopher",
  "My own contentious relationship with gaming continued through high school and college: I still enjoyed playing games from time to time, but I always found myself pushed away by the sexism that permeated gaming culture. There were constant reminders that I didn't really belong.": "Anita",
  "Starbucks has a role and a meaningful relationship with people that is not only about the coffee.": "Howard",
  "It is not our purpose to become each other; it is to recognize each other, to learn to see the other and honor him for what he is.": "Hermann",
  "Don't smother each other. No one can grow in the shade.": "Leo",
  "The better you know yourself, the better your relationship with the rest of the world.": "Toni",
  "The most important things to do in the world are to get something to eat, something to drink and somebody to love you.": "Brendan",
  "Almost all of our relationships begin and most of them continue as forms of mutual exploitation, a mental or physical barter, to be terminated when one or both parties run out of goods.": "W.",
  "Relationships are like traffic lights. And I just have this theory that I can only exist in a relationship if it's a green light.": "Taylor",
  "Self-reflection is so healthy. Journaling works for me - when I record the details of what I'm going through, whether it's a relationship issue or negative thoughts, I can look back and see how far I've come. It makes me proud to see my progress and how I got through a bad situation.": "Kelly",
  "I have a love/hate relationship with jogging.": "Lisa",
  "It's better to have loved and lost than to have to do forty pounds of laundry a week.": "Laurence",
  "What love we've given, we'll have forever. What love we fail to give, will be lost for all eternity.": "Leo",
  "I'm more of an adventurous type than a relationship type.": "Bob",
  "If love means that one person absorbs the other, then no real relationship exists any more. Love evaporates; there is nothing left to love. The integrity of self is gone.": "Ann",
  "The relationship between a client must be 'we.'": "Billy",
  "It is plain indeed that in spite of later estrangement Hobbits are relatives of ours: far nearer to us than Elves, or even than Dwarves. Of old they spoke the languages of Men, after their own fashion, and liked and disliked much the same things as Men did. But what exactly our relationship is can no longer be discovered.": "J.",
  "We have had a rewarding relationship, the belly and I.": "Sherwin",
  "The heart is forever inexperienced.": "Henry",
  "Great salespeople are relationship builders who provide value and help their customers win.": "Jeffrey",
  "Looking back over the years, I realize the Bible isn't magic, but it is corrective; it isn't an answer book, it is a living book; it isn't a fix-it book, it is relationship book. When I confront God's word, I am confronted; when I read God's word, it reads me; when I seek God's presence, He seeks me.": "Mike",
  "On a serious level, I wouldn't tell the press if I was in a relationship or not. I wouldn't ever reveal that, because it takes you down a certain road... I have no desire to be courting the press with my love life.": "Kit",
  "The relationship with time changes when you're captive.": "Ingrid",
  "Yet, taught by time, my heart has learned to glow for other's good, and melt at other's woe.": "Homer",
  "Some people are your relatives but others are your ancestors, and you choose the ones you want to have as ancestors. You create yourself out of those values.": "Ralph",
  "Love is never lost. If not reciprocated, it will flow back and soften and purify the heart.": "Washington",
  "I could see myself in a relationship with a girl Olivia Wilde is so sexy she makes me want to strangle a mountain ox with my bare hands. She's mesmerizing. ": "Megan",
  "My relationship with God has gotten so much stronger. He's always had his hand on me. He always guided me. I didn't always go where he wanted me to go. But He always had me. Now that I'm actually listening and being obedient, life is so much better.": "DMX",
  "The single woman is a free woman, and being single does not mean being alone - it means being free to have a relationship or not. This can be scary, but it's also very interesting.": "Monica",
  "I think it's always natural for children to rebel against their parents and establish their own identity. And also, I think parents get invested in, you know, doing the right thing? And so their anxiety about being good parents might, in a way, affect a relationship negatively.": "Jewell",
  "It's a great relationship when you can work with the person who you consider to be your soul mate.": "Rick",
  "The essential relationship across American history between black people and white people is one of exploitation and one of plunder. This is not, you know, necessarily about, you know, whether you're a good person or not or whether you see black people, you know, on the street, and you're willing to shake their hands and be polite.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "In human relationships, kindness and lies are worth a thousand truths.": "Graham",
  "Spiritual relationship is far more precious than physical. Physical relationship divorced from spiritual is body without soul.": "Mahatma",
  "The cinema began with a passionate, physical relationship between celluloid and the artists and craftsmen and technicians who handled it, manipulated it, and came to know it the way a lover comes to know every inch of the body of the beloved. No matter where the cinema goes, we cannot afford to lose sight of its beginnings.": "Martin",
  "After the 9/11 incidents, Islam has become a big question mark among westerners, especially Americans. The mass media constantly raise the issue of relationship between Islam and terrorism.": "Abdolkarim",
  "There's a really unique relationship between a single parent and their child. Marriages so easily break up. There's kind of this temporary deal about marriages. That's one of the things that makes it stressful, and that's something that's nonexistent in a parent-child relationship.": "Jeremy",
  "People aren't defined by their relationship. The whole point is being true to yourself and not losing yourself in relationships, whether romances or friendships.": "Nina",
  "In a relationship, it's important to make each other laugh. To give each other freedom, support each other and be proud of each other.": "Caroline",
  "What is real is that adultery destroys tens of thousands of families every year across America. What is real is that adultery scars tens of thousands of children emotionally and psychologically every year. What is real is that adultery is an open wound in a relationship which more often than not overflows into domestic violence or worse.": "Mike",
  "The relationship between a Russian and a bottle of vodka is almost mystical.": "Richard",
  "There is but one way for a president to deal with Congress, and that is continuously, incessantly, and without interruption. If it is really going to work, the relationship has got to be almost incestuous.": "Lyndon",
  "The relationship between a manufacturer and his advertising agency is almost as intimate as the relationship between a patient and his doctor. Make sure that you can life happily with your prospective client before you accept his account.": "David",
  "But you know, I have a pretty good relationship with the press and the paparazzi. It's just when they step over the line that, you know, enough's enough.": "Elton",
  "Don't throw petals on the floor if they have no meaning. I would rather have a fun, casual relationship than have someone pretending they're completely in love with me.": "Ashley",
  "Memories are thoughts that arise. They're not realities. Only when you believe that they are real, then they have the power over you. But when you realize it's just another thought arising about the past, then you can have a spacious relationship with that thought. The thought no longer has you in its grip.": "Eckhart",
  "I think as humans we do want to control our relationships, and you can't. It's probably better that you can't. That wouldn't be a real relationship, and we'd never learn and grow.": "Caroline",
  "Have gratitude for the things you're discarding. By giving gratitude, you're giving closure to the relationship with that object, and by doing so, it becomes a lot easier to let go.": "Marie",

  "I wanted a good relationship with my mother, and I realized I had a choice: Either I could spend all my time angry that she didn't give me the hugs I thought I needed, or I could understand that she hugs differently. It's not a spread-open-the-arms, 'come here' hug. She hugs by sheltering me from her worries.": "Chandra",
  "We all know the personal relationship between Michel Platini and President Blatter. It was like a mentor and protege, or even father and son.": "Chung",
  "Man only becomes independent of this physical world when he learns to consider the objects around him as symbols. He must, for this reason, seek to acquire a moral relationship to them.": "Rudolf",
  "A lot of the songs are based on my previous relationship. It didn't work out. I lost him, and it ruined me. I had to learn to get back on my feet. I used that heartbreak to create something really beautiful.": "Yuna",
  "A relationship will be futile if it's based just on physicality. Intellectual stimulation is a must for me.": "Arjun",
  "The real issue is not talent as an independent element, but talent in relationship to will, desire, and persistence. Talent without these things vanishes and even modest talent with those characteristics grows.": "Milton",
  "Obviously, a long-distance relationship is hard. But, like anything worth having, you make it work.": "Leona",
  "Once you lose the honesty in a relationship, I mean, I think you don't have a relationship at all.": "Elizabeth",
  "He's my father married to my sister. That makes me his son and his brother-in-law. That is such a moral transgression... I cannot see him. I cannot have a relationship with my father and be morally consistent. I lived with all these adopted children, so they are my family. To say Soon-Yi was not my sister is an insult to all adopted children.": "Ronan",
  "I love Neil Young. And he loves me! We have a great relationship.": "Donald",
  "I think that anyone who lives in New York, who's lived here, who's spent any time here, knows that it's basically a love-hate relationship, you might say. Even though I still think it's the greatest city in the world and I wouldn't live anywhere else, there're still things about it one doesn't like. The love far outweighs the negative.": "Spike",
  "I kind of feel like we're all humans; we all live on this planet. I kind of always wish there was more of a partnership - a really healthy relationship between people, working together to do things and make it good and change.": "Robert",
  "I tend to believe, when you're in a relationship, if you don't fight, it's not a real relationship. You have to have arguments and tensions, otherwise I don't believe it.": "Richard",
  "For a man, there's a big responsibility that comes with having a boy because men are made by their fathers. If you've got a good productive man around it's better. I have such a close relationship with my dad and that responsibility to produce a good man is something I think about.": "Rafe",
  "Every relationship that we have in our lives - our contact with each person, place, and event - serves a very special, if yet to be realized purpose: They are mirrors that can serve to show us things about ourselves that can be realized in no other way.": "Guy",
  "When we enter into a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, something wonderful happens: God begins to change our desires, and we want to be more like Him.": "Joyce",
  "Like most people, I have this sort of love-hate relationship with Pittsburgh. This is my home, and at times I miss it and find it tremendously exciting, and other times I want to catch the first thing out that has wheels.": "August",
  "From a relationship perspective, givers build deeper and broader connections.": "Adam",
  "One of the things about football is, it's a relationship business.": "Peyton",
  "The only real security is not in owning or possessing, not in demanding or expecting, not in hoping, even. Security in a relationship lies neither in looking back to what it was, nor forward to what it might be, but living in the present and accepting it as it is now.": "Anne",
  "There is not love where there is no will.": "Indira",
  "Well, a girlfriend once told me never to fight with anybody you don't love.": "Jack",

  "The heart of another is a dark forest, always, no matter how close it has been to one's own.": "Willa",
  "A relationship isn't going to make me survive. It's the cherry on top.": "Jennifer",
  "People are so fearful about opening themselves up. All you want to do is to be able to connect with other people. When you connect with other people, you connect with something in yourself. It makes you feel happy. And yet it's so scary - it makes people feel vulnerable and unsafe.": "Toni",
  "What does it matter how many lovers you have if none of them gives you the universe?": "Jacques",
  "For me, every photograph is a portrait; the clothes are just a vehicle for what I want to say. You're photographing a relationship with the person you're shooting; there's an exchange, and that's what that picture is.": "Peter",
  "Whether you're keeping a journal or writing as a meditation, it's the same thing. What's important is you're having a relationship with your mind.": "Natalie",
  "When two people in an intimate-couple relationship look at their interactions as opportunities to learn about themselves instead of change each other, they are infusing their relationship with the energy of spiritual partnership.": "Gary",
  "The biggest mistake is believing there is one right way to listen, to talk, to have a conversation - or a relationship.": "Deborah",
  "Well I think if you really go out with someone for quite a long time you do get to know each other very, very well, you go through the good times, you go through the bad times. You know both personally, but also within a relationship as well.": "Kate",
  "In 'Hardflip,' you have a relationship where the father and son haven't seen each other in 18 years, but they find they're very alike: pigheaded, stubborn, passionate. It's a wonderful story of how you can't get away from how similar you and your children are.": "John",
  "Life cannot be without relationship, but we have made it so agonizing and hideous by basing it on personal and possessive love. Can one love and yet not possess? You will find the true answer not in escape, ideals, beliefs but through the understanding of the causes of dependence and possessiveness.": "Jiddu",
  "If the relationship of father to son could really be reduced to biology, the whole earth would blaze with the glory of fathers and sons.": "James",
  "I'm human. I'm a person. I would love to be in a relationship with a man. I would love to find the right man I think that's natural - that's what we all want. ": "Lara",
  "You have to knock doors, make calls, and build a relationship with voters long before Election Day.": "Keith",
  "If you've ever had anyone in your life who has been struggling with something, struggling with addiction or struggling with anything, and it's about the resilience of love and how much you're willing to struggle with somebody to preserve your relationship and to try to preserve them as a person.": "Sarah",
  "The relationship between commitment and doubt is by no means an antagonistic one. Commitment is healthiest when it's not without doubt but in spite of doubt.": "Rollo",
  "The decision to kiss for the first time is the most crucial in any love story. It changes the relationship of two people much more strongly than even the final surrender because this kiss already has within it that surrender. ": "Emil",
  "I don't remember any sibling rivalry growing up, because by the time I was really conscious, Tom was going away to college. My relationship with him, which is a very close one, really developed in more recent years.": "David",
  "Justice is never given; it is exacted and the struggle must be continuous for freedom is never a final fact, but a continuing evolving process to higher and higher levels of human, social, economic, political and religious relationship.": "A.",
  "I have a very bad relationship with mice.": "Casey",
  "Every relationship between persons causes a picture of each to take form in the mind of the other, and this picture evidently is in reciprocal relationship with that personal relationship.": "Georg",
  "American cinema tends to express a patriotic relationship to national identity on a regular basis.": "Tom",
  "I lived to play basketball. Growing up as a kid, Bill Russell and the Boston Celtics were my favorite team. The way they played, the teamwork, the sacrifice, the commitment, the joy, the camaraderie, the relationship with the fans.": "Bill",
  "I'm not a good father and they're not children any more; the eldest is in his fifties. My relationship with their mothers broke down and, because of what the law was, they went with their mothers and were imbued with their mothers' morality in life and they were not my people any more.": "Wilbur",
  "My glasses are from Cutler & Gross. They're not prescription: I just love wearing them. I used to wear Ray-Ban a lot and then I realised that a lot of the things I've started going for are a little bit more refined. I liked the fact that I was supporting a British brand, somebody I could have a relationship with and people that I could talk to.": "Tinie",
  "After my father died when I was seven and my mother entered into an abusive relationship, I shuffled between houses - staying with friends, families from church, and relying on the kindness of teachers and people throughout my community to help me grow up essentially without parents.": "Ronnie",
  "The relationship between renewable energy sources and the communities we expect to host them must be appropriate and sustainable and, above all, acceptable to local people.": "Owen",
  "When I'm training a dog, I develop a relationship with that dog. He's my buddy, and I want to make training fun.": "Ian",
  "I happen to love engineering. I love figuring things out in a spatial sense, that whole realm of working with mechanical parts, and the relationship of the parts, and things like ratios and the speeds of particular objects.": "Arthur",
  "I can encourage my daughter to love her body, but what really matters are the observations she makes about my relationship with my own body.": "Brene",
  "Everyone talks about building a relationship with your customer. I think you build one with your employees first.": "Angela",
  "I think there is a big difference between the music business and music. And my relationship is to music, not music business. I think the business will keep changing, but music won't. Music will be there.": "Yoko",
  "When I work, my first relationship with people is professional.": "Bill",
  "The relationship with my people, the Nigerian people, is very good. My relationship with the rulers has always been problematic.": "Chinua",
  "I love children and I love family and I love that interaction. Because I had a really close relationship with my mother, I understand that deep powerful love, and it's so beautiful. To be a mother to a child is the most brilliant gift; it's gorgeous.": "Alicia",
  "I think there is a poem out there for everyone, to be an entrance into the poetry and a relationship with it.": "Natasha",
  "God is the name people give to the reason we are here. But I think that reason is the laws of physics rather than someone with whom one can have a personal relationship. An impersonal God.": "Stephen",
  "The physicality of a real relationship - one that encompasses mind, body and soul - ultimately makes it more fulfilling and powerful than any virtual relationship ever could be.": "Henry",
  "Those who are truly contemporary are those who neither perfectly coincide with their time nor adapt to its demands... Contemporariness, then, is that relationship with time that adheres to it through a disconnection.": "Giorgio",
  "I want a permanent relationship, and I might feel inclined to reject anything which of its nature could not be permanent.": "Alan",
  "I am not moved by what people say or do concerning my relationship with God. I submit myself to His direct will, which is good and perfect with no evil in it.": "T.",

  "The pilot is the wedding, and the series is the relationship.": "Thomas",
  "Every garden scheme should have a backbone, a central idea beautifully phrased. Every wall, path, stone and flower should have its relationship to the central idea.": "Edwin",
  "It's strange. At some point in your career, the situation between yourself and the camera reverses. For a certain number of years, you court it and you need it, but ultimately, it needs you more, and it's a bit like a relationship. The minute that happens, it turns you off... and it does feel like it is taking something from you.": "George",
  "The relationship between you and your boss will change over time. When you just started out, that boss was your mentor and took you under their wing. As a seasoned employee, though, you no longer need your boss to guide you along. You should be able to handle tasks on your own.": "John",
  "To me, one of the big silver linings of the Simpson trial is the advances we've made in understanding domestic violence as a lethal problem. Before that trial, I think there was a widespread sense that it was a family affair, a normal part of a relationship, not really a crime. The reality is that it's very much a crime, and a very serious one.": "Marcia",
  "Enchanted partnership begins with the conscious understanding, on the part of two people, that the purpose of their relationship is not so much material as spiritual, and the internal skills demanded by it are prodigious.": "Marianne",
  "None of us can claim to be fair and square in love - and I'm definitely not a hypocrite! Humans are built to evolve with time. It depends on the nature of the relationship you share with a person. It is there today, tomorrow it may be gone; c'est la vie.": "Randeep",
  "We should never denigrate any other culture but rather help people to understand the relationship between their own culture and the dominant culture. When you understand another culture or language, it does not mean that you have to lose your own culture.": "Edward",
  "We're thrilled to expand our relationship, knowing that with the great team at the Music Group, Word, and Warner Bros., and with their proven record of excellence, we're looking ahead to an even brighter future for Curb.": "Mike",
  "There is a relationship between cartooning and people like Mir= and Picasso which may not be understood by the cartoonist, but it definitely is related even in the early Disney.": "Roy",
  "Not to sound too Dr. Phil all of a sudden, but I think the key to survival is to embrace one's past and to not run away from it. And to come to some sort of relationship with it or understanding of it.": "Anderson",
  "It's the relationship I have with the world: always trying to escape from reality. I'm a daydreamer I don't feel in harmony with my epoch or the societies I live in. ": "Amin",
  "The erosion of extended family concept and losing out on values are the two things that are primarily responsible for the growing mismatch in the parent-child relationship.": "Shiv",
  "Perhaps this is the most important thing for me to take back from beach-living: simply the memory that each cycle of the tide is valid each cycle of the wave is valid each cycle of a relationship is valid. ": "Anne",
  "When you're in a relationship, if you just break it down to regular terms, people are attracted to something, and that's what they want you to be, and that's what you should just be, and for me, it's very simple - if I meet a girl and I say, 'This is what I like about you. Just continue. Every day.'": "Marilyn",
  "People that I care about, that I consider being friends of mine, most of the things I discuss with them I wouldn't discuss in public because it's a real relationship. It's not a relationship for the public, you know?": "Common",
  "Take responsibility and make a relationship the best it can be. We're all afraid of being hurt. Get rid of that fear. Be in the moment and enjoy the relationship - or you'll ruin it.": "Moran",
  "The goal when you get into a relationship is not to be out of the relationship. It's to try to stay in the relationship. But if it doesn't work, you can't force those things.": "Kate",
  "I'm not the kind of person to jump into a relationship with a guy. I do a lot of figuring out about the person and his background, what he wants, and why he is interested in me.": "Sofia",
  "When I was younger, the idea of the bad boy was appealing, but then I grew up and realized that stable people are more fulfilling. Bad boys need more time to themselves. I want to be in a relationship with someone who knows how to take care of himself and is therefore able to take care of me. That way, we can put each other first.": "Jessica",
  "What's at the heart of my faith is a belief that there's a creator. That we're all children of the same God. And that, fundamentally, the relationship you have with your spouse is important and eternal.": "Mitt",
  "'The Story of Us' is about running into someone I had been in a relationship with at an awards show, and we were seated a few seats away from each other. I just wanted to say to him, 'Is this killing you? Because it's killing me.' But I didn't. Because I couldn't. Because we both had these silent shields up.": "Taylor",
  "I personally don't believe people really grow. They just learn stuff when they were a kid, and hold on to it, and that affects every relationship they have.": "Donald",
  "Androgyny is not trying to manage the relationship between the opposites it is simply flowing between them. ": "June",
  "There is a time for risky love. There is a time for extravagant gestures. There is a time to pour out your affections on one you love. And when the time comes - seize it, don't miss it.": "Max",
  "Many Japanese painters and calligraphers would change their names intentionally to keep their relationship to the art always fresh. This way, others' expectations can be avoided.": "Tina",
  "I've always had this interest in sibling relationships because I don't have any siblings. I'm completely a product of the one-child policy in China, so I always kind of wished that I had an older brother or a younger brother or sister just to have that bond, so I find myself constantly writing about that relationship.": "Marie",
  "The older you get, the more you start to realize that you can't win an argument in a relationship. You can't win a fight with your woman. Because if you lose, you lose. And if you win, you lose.": "Trevor",
  "I don't think any relationship responds well to pressure.": "Adam",
  "What we need to understand is that when traditions become laws, rules, obligations and expectations others put on us that we don't want to fulfill, then they lose real meaning and steal the joy from our lives. And if we're too religious, we won't be able to be led by the Holy Spirit and enjoy an intimate relationship with Him.": "Joyce",
  "I work a lot of hours, and in this business you really try to keep as busy as you possibly can. Sometimes when you really focus on kids in your free time you lose the husband and wife relationship to some degree. It's been a real focus for us to make sure we stay focused on us two.": "Cameron",
  "Relationships can be very traumatic. But being in a healthy relationship can be very empowering.": "Kangana",
  "The relationship between Israel and the United States is a bond of - it's just a very powerful bond. It was, it is, and will be and will continue to be.": "Benjamin",
  "No one can tell you what to expect or can offer a guide to grief. Because every relationship is so unique, no two people grieve the same way. And you have no idea how you are going to grieve till you are grieving.": "Alysia",
  "The man as he converses is the lover; silent, he is the husband.": "Honore",
  "There's a trick to the Graceful Exit. It begins with the vision to recognize when a job, a life stage, a relationship is over - and to let go. It means leaving what's over without denying its value.": "Ellen",
  "Love sought is good, but given unsought, is better.": "William",
  "Adultery is the ultimate deal-breaker for me. I would rather be alone than in a relationship that doesn't honor me.": "Garcelle",
  "The special relationship between twins is that, if there's anyone else in the world that's going to get or be the confidant that you need, it's an identical twin.": "Sam",
  "Just as you go to the gym regularly to keep your body fit, regular couples counseling can keep your relationship fit as well.": "Laura",
  "It is so much easier to be nice, to be respectful, to put yourself in your customers' shoes and try to understand how you might help them before they ask for help, than it is to try to mend a broken customer relationship.": "Mark",
  "We must learn to regard people less in light of what they do or omit to do, and more in the light of what they suffer.": "Dietrich",
  "Yes, I think it's really important to acknowledge that Dr. King, precisely at the moment of his assassination, was re-conceptualizing the civil rights movement and moving toward a sort of coalitional relationship with the trade union movement.": "Angela",
  "Personally, I think fidelity is important. I don't see any point in being together if you're not being honest, having fun together, and respecting one another. Why would you stay in a relationship otherwise?": "Nikolaj",
  "It is a parent's responsibility to preserve the connection with their children, to preserve the relationship, so that the children can let go and become their own selves.": "Gordon",
  "For the United States to be a global leader, we have to have a very tight relationship with Europe. And we've held that relationship since 1949 when we established the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO. NATO is the bond. It's a security bond.": "Wesley",
  "It is better to have a relationship with someone who cheats on you than with someone who does not flush the toilet.": "Uma",

  "Absence diminishes mediocre passions and increases great ones, as the wind extinguishes candles and fans fires.": "Francois",
  "You are a child of the sun, you come from the sun, and that is something true with the Earth also... your relationship with the Earth is so deep, and the Earth is in you and this is something not very difficult, much less difficult then philosophy.": "Thich",
  "I spend a great deal of time with the President. We have a very close, personal, loyal relationship. I'm not, as they say, a potted plant in these meetings.": "Dan",

  "I'm afraid the SS's relationship with the Catholic Church is something the Church still has to deal with and does not deny.": "Christopher",
  "A father-son relationship is strong, like no other teammates. You could be straightforward with one another.": "Mario",
  "I think in a way, you're doomed, once you can envision something. You're sort of doomed to make it happen. I've found that the moment I can envision leaving a relationship, that's usually the moment that the relationship starts to fall apart.": "Chuck",
  "Poetry is a form of mathematics, a highly rigorous relationship with words.": "Tahar",
  "We cannot really love anyone with with whom we never laugh.": "Agnes",
  "Caresses, expressions of one sort or another, are necessary to the life of the affections as leaves are to the life of a tree. If they are wholly restrained, love will die at the roots.": "Nathaniel",

  "In a relationship each person should support the other they should lift each other up. ": "Taylor",
  "Real relationship is gritty and earthy, the stuff that life is made of.": "Amy",
  "I've come to the conclusion that a long, personal relationship is next to impossible for me. Ultimately, music is a possessive mistress.": "Leonard",
  "When I look at relationships, my own and others, I see a wide range of reasons for people to be together and ways in which they are together. I see ways in which a relationship - which means something that exists between two or more people - for the most part reinforces people's separateness as individual entities.": "Ram",
  "I would say that I have a love-hate relationship with almost everything in my life, including stand-up.": "Chelsea",
  "The seductiveness of war derives in part from its location on this boundary of the human, the inhuman, and the superhuman. It requires us to confront the relationship among the noble, the horrible, and the infinite; the animal, the spiritual, and the divine.": "Drew",
  "'Before I Ever Met You' was the first one to come out and that just dives into the grit, and it's pretty graphic about a relationship. For my first song, it was very special the way it happened, because I didn't really hold anything back, and people responded to it.": "Jillian",
  "The first duty of a human being is to assume the right functional relationship to society - more briefly, to find your real job, and do it.": "Charlotte",
  "The relationship between parents and children, but especially between mothers and daughters, is tremendously powerful, scarcely to be comprehended in any rational way.": "Joyce",
  "My parents had us in church every Sunday, every Wednesday. It was more of a tradition at that point; I didn't have a personal relationship with the Lord until I went to the altar call one Sunday, and the youth pastor told us to make a decision for ourselves.": "Stephen",

  "Ultimately, we wish the joy of perfect union with the person we love.": "Mortimer",
  "I think you learn more about yourself in the context of a relationship than you can outside of it.": "Pink",
  "In my relationship with God, I've learned that if I follow a 'formula' for how I spend my time with Him, then I'm just accomplishing a checklist of things I feel obligated to do to please Him. This makes my spiritual life more about doing what I need to do to fulfill an obligation than something meaningful.": "Joyce",

  "I kept a very full diary of my relationship with Nixon, for some strange reason, until he became president.": "Billy",
  "Small unit autonomy, breaking the right rules, cultural influence, and relationship building has always been the heart Special Operations. Something must be done to ensure these are not lost to the big machine of SOCOM.": "Brandon",
  "My father and I have a very good relationship. We always got along. But I always scold him.": "Amy",

  "No gentleman ever discusses any relationship with a lady.": "Keith",
  "Playing a character who's dealing not only with a superpower but having a normal relationship is easy to associate with, because I feel that everyone has been through it.": "Shawn",
  "I know children regress after vaccination because it happened to my own son. Why aren't there any tests out there on the safety of how vaccines are administered in the real world, six at a time? Why have only two of the 36 shots our kids receive been looked at for their relationship to autism?": "Jenny",
  "I feel there's a power in theatre, but it's an indirect power. It's like the relationship of the sleeper to the unconscious. You discover things you can't afford to countenance in waking life. You can forget them, remember them a day later or not have any idea what they are about.": "Tony",
  "I wasn't smart enough to read relationship books when I was coming up. I learned everything the hard way.": "Michael",
  "Because I live in the countryside, I want a building which encourages me to have a fully formed relationship with the environment. It gives me an opportunity to not just be inside or outside, but in a range of contexts.": "Kevin",
  "People put so much effort into starting a relationship and so little effort into ending one.": "Marina",
  "Divorce isn't one-sided, and I am by no means perfect. Becoming accountable for my role in the relationship was very empowering.": "Garcelle",
  "That's the sign of a good relationship, when you can pick up a phone and it doesn't matter when the last time you spoke was.": "Joe",
  "I worship pianos like they are prize diamonds, and I never willfully do damage to them. But I grew up playing guitars, and you treat a guitar like a best friend or a little brother or a lover you have a tempestuous relationship with.": "Jamie",
  "I like the relationship between the master and the student. Each piece has new problems, and each is different. They're all an indentured servitude. There's that subjugation that you have to put yourself under. It's a give and take. There is work involved, and during that time, the greatest things are revealed.": "Mike",
  "I definitely consider myself a Christian. There's things that I believe in, there's things I have a self-belief on. I know I got a great relationship with God and the universe. I just believe in being a righteous person and karma. Doing unto others as you would have done unto you. I really want to help teach that.": "Big",
  "Very early in life, it seemed to me that there was a relationship between the problems of the Negro people in America and the Jewish people in Russia, and that the Jewish people's problems were worse than ours.": "Langston",

  "There is no substitute for the comfort supplied by the utterly taken-for-granted relationship.": "Iris",
  "When you think about it, we actors are kind of prostitutes. We get paid to feign attraction and love. Other people are paying to watch us kissing someone, touching someone, doing things people in a normal monogamous relationship would never do with anyone who's not their partner. It's really kind of gross.": "Megan",
  "I don't have a bad relationship. I'm 48 years old. I think life is too short for that. To me, life is... you open the shutters, you see the dogs outside, you look left, you look right, in, what, a second and a half? And that's a life.": "Jean-Claude",
  "It's easy in a novel to be completely unambiguous about the relationship between animal and daemon simply by stating it outright whereas you get very few opportunities to do this in an elegant way in a film. ": "Chris",
  "There is an interaction and action, reaction between two people. One should show honesty in a relationship. Be honest to your partner and tell him everything. How long can you do things with dishonesty and that's wrong. Don't get into a relationship if you can't be honest.": "Randeep",
  "We live in a society that celebrates familial connection above any other kind of relationship. We are shown photos of our great-grandparents and encouraged to marvel over facial similarities. We are told to take pride in our bloodlines, celebrate our ancestry.": "Lynn",
  "I think the first outfit that really kick-started my relationship with Chanel means a lot to me: it was a black, sort of Studio 54-inspired jumpsuit with gold stars all over it, and I wore that, and that's how my relationship with Chanel began, so, you know, it has sentimental value.": "Poppy",
  "Real intimacy is only possible to the degree that we can be honest about what we are doing and feeling.": "Joyce",
  "No partner in a love relationship... should feel that he has to give up an essential part of himself to make it viable.": "May",
  "The loss of young first love is so painful that it borders on the ludicrous.": "Maya",
  "Maybe the most that you can expect from a relationship that goes bad is to come out of it with a few good songs.": "Marianne",
  "I have developed a very strong partiality for the dead: they don't talk back, they don't sue, and they don't have angry relatives.": "Ron",

  "I do not think that Mulder trusts any one other than Scully. He s very solitary. She is the only one who takes him seriously. I don t know if they re in love. In a way, their relationship is deeper than that, because they cannot live without each other.": "David",
  "This is the point being missed by readers who lament Liquor's lack of hot sex scenes, probably because they aren't old enough to understand that a passionate relationship could be about anything other than sex.": "Poppy",

  "I've got a new relationship and I'm trapped in this old life.": "Moon",

  "This thing with everyone knowing you, it's weird, because people have this one-sided relationship where they look at your picture and feel they know you more than someone they actually know. I don't really know myself that well.": "Robert",
  "This 'Making Mirrors' album is far more personal, even if there's a character element to the sounds I'm working with. Every song on this album I stand behind; I feel like I have a close relationship with them. There are older songs where I can feel myself writing a story, so this is the first album where I'm proud of every lyric.'": "Gotye",
  "A lot of people over time have had this kind of pattern in their relationship with Bill Clinton. You first meet him and you're overwhelmed by his talent. He's so energetic and articulate and full of ideas and he calls himself a congenital optimist and that optimism is contagious.": "Dee",
  "While I don't often use the word, the technically precise term for my orientation is bisexual. I believe bisexuality is not a choice, it is a fact. What I have 'chosen' is to be in a gay relationship.": "Cynthia",

  "I have had a love-hate relationship with my body.": "Demi",
  "The attack on ObamaCare was that Congress does not have the power under the Commerce Clause to force a private citizen into a private contractual relationship.

  "Anyone working for a big company might be skeptical that a large business, or even a strictly online business, can form the same kind of friendly, loyal relationship with customers as a local retailer. I'm saying it's already been done because I lived it.": "Gary",
  "Contentment does not come from achievement. It comes from a relationship with the Lord.": "Paul",
  "I think the most important foundation about any relationship is just being honest. You've got to. My wife and I are honest to a fault with each other, and we're best friends on top of it, so we're very fortunate.": "Max",

  "My relationship with money is that it's a tool to be self-sufficient, but it's not something that is a part of who I am.": "Laurene",
  "In Afghan society, parents play a central role in the lives of their children; the parent-child relationship is fundamental to who you are and what you become and how you perceive yourself, and it is laden with contradictions, with tension, with anger, with love, with loathing, with angst.": "Khaled",

  "Having people I love around me - friends and family - is great, but I don't necessarily need a relationship.": "Olga",
  "Too many leaders are so caught up in the momentum of work that they lose sight of the opportunity to connect with people.

  "People love to hate. I have a love-hate relationship with the world. The world loves to hate me.": "Andy",
  "In improv, the whole thing is that it is a relationship between the two people, as a back and forth. In standup, you don't really want to be listening to what somebody is saying; you want to project your jokes into their face. And that's really not a good instinct with a 'Daily Show' field piece, where it's supposed to be an interview.": "John",
  "I'm genuine and I'm available. I want people to be at their best. I want them to love and be loved to their fullest ability. My friends call me their relationship nanny, so we have a good time working through problems. Now, I don't claim to be an expert, but I am a woman who has been through everything.": "Niecy",

  "Spiritual direction is an interpersonal relationship in which we learn how to grow, live, and love in the spiritual life.": "Richard",
  "I don't know what a person does that does not have a relationship with God. When he goes to the doctor and the doctors says, 'Hey, you've got less than two months to live and there's nothing we can do for you.' Who do they turn to when you're given something that earth shattering?": "Si",
  "I have no idea what my best material is. Different people like different things. I'll say this: The political stuff gets the press, but the relationship jokes sell all the seats.": "Chris",
  "You can't have a relationship with a device whose limits are unknown to you, because without limits, it keeps becoming something else.": "Brian",
  "Umm... I don't judge my relationship with Puff or Bad Boy according to other people or past artists. At the end of the day, you are in charge of your career, and you can't depend on no man to do anything for you.

  "The entire value of a person is subjective to your relationship with them.": "Natalia",
  "The depth of the love of parents for their children cannot be measured. It is like no other relationship. It exceeds concern for life itself. The love of a parent for a child is continuous and transcends heartbreak and disappointment.": "James",

  "I think compassion is important but love fizzles out eventually. But if there is compassion in a relationship, things can always be worked out.": "Anushka",

  "My parents divorced when I was very, very young, but they maintained an incredibly amicable relationship.

  "Think about all kinds of infectious diseases, like mumps or measles or chicken pox. When a virgin population encountered those pathogens, it ravaged the population, and now they're childhood diseases, and eventually they won't even be that. That's our relationship with bacteria, going through time.": "Bonnie",
  "The relationship with the cast has everything to do with how a performance develops, and in a sense that while you're discovering a play in the course of rehearsal with the director, you're also discovering it with your fellow actors. We're all in it together.": "Kevin",
  "I have never been in a serious relationship and never had a break-up, so I can't tug on my heartstrings that way. But whenever I experience a strong emotion in life, I definitely have to throw myself into my songwriting. It is very therapeutic.": "Ella",

  "In my relationship with a young guy I was going with in a band - his name was Sylvester, and I think he had another little girl on the side - I told him, 'If you lose me, you're going to lose a good thing.' And I went home and put that poem to music.": "Barbara",
  "Redwoods flourish in fog, but they don't like salt air. They tend to appear in valleys that are just out of sight of the sea. In their relationship with the sea, redwoods are like cats that long to be stroked but are shy to the touch.": "Richard",

  "Business colleagues who have not seen each other for a long time but who have a good relationship can always shake hands warmly and grab each other's right upper arm or shoulder with their free left hand. Men and women executives should not kiss each other in public.": "Letitia",
  "It's a very tricky relationship, the cinematographer and the director as a woman.": "Patricia",
  "The ultimate relationship between justice and law will be an eternal subject for speculation and analysis. But it may be said that in a democratic society, law is the form which free men give to justice.": "Robert",
  "I have more of a relationship with the subject than I do with my camera equipment. To me, camera equipment is like a tin of shoe polish and a brush - I use that as a tool, but my basic camera is my emotion and my eyes. It's not anything to do with the wonderful cameras I use.": "Don",
  "The relationship I have with my Hispanic fans is very deep and intricate.": "Shakira",

  "Comedy can't be done in a vacuum, and you can't do it on your own. So if you have a community of people, it's a great symbiotic relationship.": "Nick",
  "Everyone talks about new love all the time, but there's so much to draw from when you've been in a longer relationship. It makes me stick my chest out a little bit. It's like, 'I know what you've been through, but you don't know what it's like over here.'": "Dierks",
  "If you're a woman, it's almost impossible to establish a relationship. You're too much for everybody. It's too much. The woman always has to play this role of being fragile and dependent. And if you're not, they're fascinated by you, but only for a little while. And then they want to change you and crush you. And then they leave.": "Marina",
  "The customer is a remarkably selfish person: He takes the relationship to where the execution is in his favor.": "Azim",

  "A lot of people don't understand the Black Panthers Party's relationship with white mother country radicals.": "Fred",
  "I tell my kids and my grandkids, 'Never forget where you came from. Never forget your roots.' My grandkids, they didn't go through the hard times as much as other ones in our family did. One thing is to just never forget where you came from and you never forget that nothing is more important than your relationship with Jesus Christ.": "Kay",
  "I have a love-hate relationship with performing.": "Sarah",
  "There is among us a far closer relationship than the purely social one of a fraternal organization because we are bound together not only by a single interest but by a common goal. To win. Nothing else matters, and nothing else will do.": "Sandy",
  "So the American government lied to the Native Americans for many, many years, and then President Clinton lied about a relationship, and everyone was surprised! A little naive, I feel!": "Eddie",
  "My family gave me values that have sustained me through situations that would challenge any person. My personal relationship with the Lord inspires me in all I do.": "Kathy",
  "A relationship is lovely if you're happy, comfortable in it and you really like the person. I can think of nothing better. But there's nothing worse than having a relationship in which you feel no interest.": "Susannah",

  "I have a love-hate relationship with white silk.": "Alan",
  "I have a strange relationship with time. I'm not aware of it passing.": "Daniel",
  "I'm a better person in a relationship, and I'm a happier person. I need to come home at the end of the day and have it not be about me and my freaking hair and makeup and character motivations anymore. And I think my work is more inspired when home is safe and sound and solid, because what I do for a living is so bananas and so insecure.": "Ginnifer",
  "Even if you know that what you'll say will hurt a woman's feelings, I've learned that it's better to be truthful with her than it is to cover up. Ultimate honesty is what a relationship is really about.": "Stephen",
  "Every relationship has its own language. It takes a long time to evolve and read one another. Just as it's true for people, it's also true on a national or cultural level.": "David",
  "I love what I do, but it is hard to have a personal relationship when you're never home.": "Blake",
  "You've got to be in a bad relationship to really understand what a great one is.": "Steve",
  "People that spend time in a foxhole - they're never going to find that relationship anywhere else again... Everything else pales next to that. When you think about the Second World War vets - more than even the Vietnam vets - there's a brotherhood.": "Sylvester",
  "Being pregnant finally helped me understand what my true relationship was with my body - meaning that it wasn't put on this earth to look good in a swimsuit.": "Amy",
  "Whenever you're in a relationship, you have that favorite song that reminds you of when you first got together or when you first kissed, and then every time you hear that song, it reminds you of that person.": "Olly",

  "For most of us, relationship with another is based on dependence, either economic or psychological. This dependence creates fear, breeds in us possessiveness, results in friction, suspicion, frustration.": "Jiddu",
  "My father was on the Judiciary Committee all 18 years. He had a good personal relationship with Jim Eastland. They probably didn't agree on practically anything, or very little, from a public policy standpoint. But they were willing to work through that to see what they could get done just because they knew each other and liked each other.": "Evan",
  "The U.S.-China relationship is one of the most important bilateral relationships in the world.": "Max",
  "Minimalism seems closest to the sophisticated storytelling of movies. Movies have really educated contemporary audiences to be the most intelligent, sophisticated audiences in history. We don't any longer need to have the relationship between one scene and the next explained. We will figure it out ourselves.": "Chuck",
  "When people hold you in high esteem, it's very delicate relationship. When they meet you they're putting all their chips up. It's make or break.": "Henry",

  "American official policy is that Egypt is an ally of the United States. Of course, we recognize that Egypt has gone through a dramatic change in government. And what their status will be going forward in terms of the relationship with our nation is something which which I'm sure will be developing over time.": "Mitt",
  "Our relationship with Egypt is very, very important. And I would want them to remain an ally. I don't want to see that official status change.": "Mitt",
  "I don't know how to have a normal relationship because I try to act normal and love from a normal place and live a normal life, but there is sort of an abnormal magnifying glass, like telescope lens, on everything that happens.": "Taylor",
  "I can imagine it's hard to make a relationship last. I wouldn't know.": "Taylor",
  "The drama and the trauma of the relationship you have when you're 16 can mirror the one you have when you're 26. Life repeats itself.": "Taylor",

  "We can improve our relationships with others by leaps and bounds if we become encouragers instead of critics.": "Joyce",
  "Prayer is such a basic foundation of a Christian's relationship with God. It's how we communicate and fellowship with Him. But a surprising number of people, young and old, new and even long-time Christians, say they're not satisfied with their prayer life.": "Joyce",
  "People who don't know the true character of God - who don't believe He is merciful, gracious and slow to anger - can never have a close, personal, intimate relationship with Him.": "Joyce",
  "The truth is God created us to have relationship with us. He wants to love us and take care of us, and He wants us to love Him. That's where our walk with Christ has to start.": "Joyce",

  "History shows us that in times of people feeling like they are in need of some sort of rebellion or protests, the artists rise because the poetry we create about pain and its relationship to culture in the world begins to soothe and heal people who are feeling confused or afraid.": "Lady",
  "I want to be judged by who I am, not by a relationship.": "Rand",
  "God is more interested in your future and your relationships than you are.": "Billy",

  "I can see how a relationship with a writer would be an easy thing.": "Jeff",
  "Part of our tradition as black women is that we are universalists. Black children, yellow children, red children, brown children, that is the black woman's normal, day-to-day relationship. In my family alone, we are about four different colors.": "Alice",

  "I have a very healthy relationship to my work, and I find that if a scene is working, no matter how intense it is, you have the catharsis on screen, and you can let it go. I think it's, if at the end of the day you feel like you haven't cracked it, that's when you go home and it's more difficult to switch off.": "Cate",
  "In the grip of a neurological disorder, I am fast losing control of words even as my relationship with the world has been reduced to them.": "Christopher",

  "Anxiety and spiritual searching have been consistent themes with me, and that figures into my worldview. But I tend to make my songs sound like relationship songs.": "David",

  "I am well placed to know that Le Pen is not an anti-Semite. If one considers his life seriously... a man who went to fight with the Israelis in '56! Many times, he tried to better the party's relationship with the Jewish community, even though I do not like the term.": "Marine",
  "The longer I go about living, I see it's the relationship that is most meaningful.": "William",
  "When you start falling for somebody and you can't stop thinking about when you're going to see them again, I love that. Women are beautiful. They deserve to be cherished and respected.": "Orlando",

  "A relationship to me is never about the romance.": "Shia",
  "A record company used to be a very good thing, but they ended up soul-destroyingly trapping people in the accounting department.

  "My relationship with shoes has always been linked to shoes, women, women in their shoes and performance.": "Christian",

  "I think that my regrets mostly have to do with my relationship with my ex-girlfriend.

Something occurs to you, 'Oh, no, I said that.'": "Mike",

  "I suspect the real reason the N.F.L. and N.B.A. don't want high schoolers and college underclassmen to play with their ball is that they don't want to jeopardize their relationship with National Collegiate Athletic Association, which serves as a sort of free minor league and unpaid promotional department for the pros.": "David",
  "I think the core of fans' relationship is one that vacillates schizophrenically and mercurially from reverence to resentment. Fans fetishize the players' athletic genius and both deify it and demonize it witness the way awe turns into anger whenever a player holds out or flips off the offensive coordinator. ": "David",

  "Without the name, any flower is still more or less a stranger to you. The name betrays its family, its relationship to other flowers, and gives the mind something tangible to grasp. It is very difficult for persons who have had no special training to learn the names of the flowers from the botany.": "John",
  "If you're married, and you have a wife, and you really love your wife, is it good enough to only say to your wife 'I love her' the day you get married? Or should you tell her every single day when you wake up and every opportunity? And that's how I feel about my relationship with Jesus Christ is that it is the most important thing in my life.": "Tim",
  "It's pretty easy for me to say that the most important thing in my life is my relationship with Jesus Christ, followed by my relationship with family. And football's later on down the line.": "Tim",
  "I mean, we're really making a quantum change in our relationship to the plant world with genetic modification.": "Michael",
  "Before I started writing about food, my focus was really on the human relationship to plants. Not only do plants nourish us bodily - they nourish us psychologically.": "Michael",
  "Regardless of the sexual orientation behind a relationship, it is still a relationship and still love.": "Hozier",
  "When one is the type of writer who cares about the meaning of the historically specific setting, the history itself is not something that I would call backdrop. It's not window dressing for a timeless relationship about love and betrayal. For me, the setting and the specific history are active co-agents with me in trying to form the novel.": "Rachel",
  "If you look at my characters as a group, they all have a different relationship with the way that places can signify emotion in them - and the way those bonds can be shattered.": "Jhumpa",
  "In terms of pace, I think I just have to revisit my relationship with expectations. That has a little bit to do with comparing ourselves to other people and seeing other people's journey and seeing how they had a certain success at a certain age.": "Mahershala",
  "I think the hardest thing to do in a relationship is something for yourself.": "Kat",
  "The strengths and failings of a relationship depend entirely on your ability to talk about your feelings.": "Spike",
  "My entire life changed when I became a mother - my priorities, my understanding, appreciation of life, and my relationship with God.": "Kourtney",
  "I totally commit and completely give myself to a relationship. Be warned, though - I don't like being taken for granted, so I can be pretty high-maintenance sometimes!": "Priyanka",
  "I have a very close relationship with my parents.": "Caroline",
  "I'm proud of my relationship with 'Star Trek'! 'Star Trek' is a show that I am philosophically compatible with.": "George",
  "I could never give relationship advice to anybody!": "Rihanna",
  "I felt a tremendous sadness for men who can't deal with a woman of their own age.": "Michael",
  "I went through a phase when I was 13 where I would only fall in love with people over the age of 19 or 20. I never had a real relationship with any of these people, but it was definitely the guy I wanted to hang out with and wanted to go on trips with. I would be like, 'But, Daddy, he's a musician!'.": "Olivia",
  "I had a great time making the last movie, 'Eclipse.' We shot my back-story stuff from the 1930's. But I was waiting for 'Breaking Dawn' because I love the relationship Rosalie has with Jacob and the rest of her family and Bella. She also provides comic relief.": "Nikki",
  "I have a long-standing relationship with Autism Speaks. I've been supporting them for many, many years now.": "Nikki",
  "Remember, if you want to love your life and live it to the fullest, don't let the sun go down on your anger. If you don't have a solution to the issue, agree to disagree and focus on the importance of the relationship.": "Victoria",
  "There's an entry point to any relationship.": "will.i.am",
  "The relationship between critic and writer is similar to the one between the pigeon and the statue.": "Ashwin",
  "My relationship with aging is cozy. I'm not trying to play 29 and holding on with white knuckles, you know?": "Diane",
  "Dylan's relationship with Johnny Cash was the biggest influence on Nashville in my lifetime - they opened up country music.": "Kris",
  "Every relationship I've been in, I've overwhelmed the girl. They just can't handle all the love.": "Justin",
  "My family and I are so close, it's important to have a close knit relationship and to make time to spend with each other, especially at the holidays.": "Gia",
  "If you ask me to describe my relationship, I mean - words are too clumsy to accurately describe how I feel in that regard, particularly in an interview. It's a strange thing.": "Ryan",
  "Remember: You are the common denominator in all your relationship problems. Wherever you go, your pesky repeated issues go - until you shed a blazing light of insight upon them.": "Karen",
  "Some people associate red with love, but to me, red is for an earlier stage of a relationship. Black is much deeper, to me. It's certainly the sexiest color.": "Dierks",
  "When you're doing collaborative music, the relationship that forms is a very bonding kind of experience.": "Condoleezza",
  "I have fallen in love so many times. If one relationship ended, I would search for another girl. I was always madly in love with all the girls that I dated.": "Nawazuddin",
  "I have stepped off the relationship scene to come to terms with myself. I have spent most of my adult life being 'someone's girlfriend', and now I am happy being single.": "Penelope",
  "It's great working with my sister, because we are very close as a family - my brother, my sister and myself. We have a great relationship.": "Penelope",
  "If you cannot inspire a woman with love of you, fill her above the brim with love of herself; all that runs over will be yours.": "Charles",
  "Dick Clark and I had such a hysterical relationship with each other.": "Vicki",
  "In any relationship, after the first year is over, you can't help but want your own space.": "Helena",
  "Anything that has a relationship with pleasure, we reject it. Eating, they talk about cholesterol; making love, they talk about AIDS; you talk about smoking, they talk about cancer. It's a very sick society that rejects pleasure.": "Marjane",
  "There's such an extreme feeling to be in love, especially in quite an emotionally destructive relationship, where you're both kind of really bad for each other, but you love each other so much. Those extreme emotions, I think, can only be described with extreme imagery.": "Florence",
  "Never assume that the guy understands that you and he have a relationship.": "Dave",
  "Men are fair, and they have learned not to personalize anger - they can disagree with you and argue to the bone, but afterward they still consider you a nice person with whom the underlying human relationship need not be altered.": "Warren",
  "I have to say when a man lives for himself, it's hard to live with him. That's pretty much the story of all my divorces. I've been making records since I was 22 and done things my way, and it's hard for me to compromise. And of course, to have a successful relationship, one has to compromise. Sometimes I'm not good at it.": "John",
  "I love being onstage. I love the relationship with the audience. I love the letting go, the sense of discovery, the improvising.": "Stephen",
  "We all think that this relationship thing is a game out here. All I'm saying to women is, 'Okay. If it's a game, here are the rules that we play by.'": "Steve",
  "I'm 31 now. I think I'm beginning to understand what life is, what romance is, and what a relationship means.": "Adam",
  "I feel that the critic and music director should have such a good relationship they can pick up the phone and call each other any time.": "Zubin",
  "I hope that anyone I worked with wouldn't exploit our relationship.": "Laura",
  "When we have machines that are as intelligent - and then twice as intelligent - as we are, there is no reason why that relationship cannot be synergistic rather than antagonistic.": "Robert",
  "I'm in a monogamous relationship and have been for many, many years. I think it's a choice. I don't think you can generalize, though, and what works for me may not work for other people, but I don't think everybody cheats. We're all different.": "Nikolaj",
  "I have a love-hate relationship with the Grammys because I don't see the music world as a competitive sport.": "James",
  "Filming 'Eclipse' - Eclipse was my favorite book so I was really excited to start filming the movie. I just love that it's the height of the love triangle. 'Twilight' develops Edward and Bella's relationship, 'New Moon' develops Jacob and Bella's and in 'Eclipse,' the three of them are physically together.": "Taylor",
  "I'm done with men... I'm going to be alone. I have no luck with relationships. I don't think I'm made for marriage.": "Halle",
  "I always believe that it's better to be idealistic in love than be that cynic. That's the only way to survive a relationship.": "Sonam",
  "I think the most important thing for me in a relationship is honesty.": "Zac",
  "Trying to make something as tricky as 'Room' really believable is extremely hard, and it largely rests with that relationship between the actors and the director, and the director and the crew.": "Lenny",
  "The intuitive connection children feel with animals can be a tremendous source of joy. The unconditional love received from pets, and the lack of artifice in the relationship, contrast sharply with the much trickier dealings with members of their own species.": "Frans",
  "I don't need anyone to rectify my existence. The most profound relationship we will ever have is the one with ourselves.": "Shirley",
  "Legal documents have mistrust written all over them. It's unfortunate, but the human DNA is so tuned to kind of taking you for granted that we tend to protect ourselves legally. That's why I don't read them as, if I read them, I will go soft. To me, the human relationship is far more important than the professional bond I share with anyone.": "Karan",
  "Several companies have explicit policies against cronyism, with good reason. Hiring a family member simply for a relationship can be troubling and may not necessarily serve a company's interests. But by and large, financial firms in particular commonly hire people who have certain connections, whether through family or a business relationship.": "Andrew",
  "The man is meant to be the alpha in the relationship on the money and power front.": "Jamie",
  "Pop stardom is not very compelling. I'm much more interested in a relationship between performer and audience that is of equals. I came up through folk music, and there's no pomp and circumstance to the performance. There's no, like, 'I'll be the rock star, you be the adulating fan.'": "Ani",
  "If a relationship has to be a secret, you shouldn't be in it.": "Regina",
  "I've never dealt with the Russian government, I've never had a relationship with the Russian government.": "Paul",
  "Most critical histories of U.S. involvement in Iran rightly began with the joint British-U.S. coup against democratically elected Prime Minister Mohammad Mosaddegh in 1953, which installed Pahlavi on the Peacock Throne. But it was Kissinger who, in 1972, greatly deepened the relationship between Washington and Tehran.": "Greg",
  "The problem is, when I talk about heartbreak or whatever, people want to melt it down to some break-up of a relationship, but it's not about that. If you're a sensitive person, just stepping outside can be heartbreaking.": "Lykke",
  "When you're in a relationship you want it to work. My parents did, I did. But we are not taught how to make it work.": "Erykah",
  "When we look at what has the strongest statistical relationship to overall evaluation of your life, the first one is your career well-being, or the mission, purpose and meaning of what you're doing when you wake up each day.": "Tom",
  "My relationship with food is intimate. I don't eat and tell.": "CeeLo",
  "Men and women have strengths that complement each other.": "Edwin",
  "With public figures involved in a relationship it seems that there is a machine behind their love so oftentimes.": "Joaquin",
  "You have to take time and make time for each other. My current single 'Time Is Love' gives a lot of advice in that area, just spending quantity time with the one you love and the one you care about because that's when you really develop a relationship.": "Josh",
  "The producer, in effect, has to work as a translator. You form a very tight relationship with the director and writer from the beginning, and then you are constantly communicating to the various people that begin to come into the process, as you are trying to manage to hold on to a vision that needs to be communicated over a long period of time.": "Kathleen",
  "I would never put my close friends or a real relationship on a show.": "Kristin",
  "To marry unequally is to suffer equally.": "Henri",
  "I can't even find someone for a platonic relationship, much less the kind where someone wants to see me naked.": "Gilbert",
  "It's funny about men and women. Men pay in cash to get them and pay in cash to get rid of them. Women pay emotionally coming and going. Neither has it easy.": "Hedy",
  "If you love somebody, you love them. My parents had a 25-year age gap between them and my mum was the breadwinner, my dad the house husband. I'm a strong believer that a good relationship can work, whatever the situation.": "Katherine",
  "I think the fact that I'm so well known to be gay makes it very difficult to have a convincing relationship with a woman on screen. It wouldn't be at all difficult for me to kiss a woman - I'll kiss a frog if you like.": "Stephen",
  "I'd like to say that I'm a rock star, but I'm not - I'm honestly more of a relationship kind of guy. I'm a guy you could take home to meet your mum rather than a guy your mum wouldn't like.": "Ed",
  "If you're giving love and not receiving it, you're not in the right relationship. If you're receiving it and not giving it than you are taking advantage of the other person.": "Patti",
  "The relationship between God and his people was always the one having absolute primacy, the one that had basically to determine all human relationships, whether those within the covenanted community itself or those between the covenanted community and the outside world.": "David",
  "I used to define success as being able to produce any result you wanted, whether it was a relationship, weight-loss, being a millionaire, impacting the culture, changing society, whatever it might be - it might be homelessness, whatever - and lately, I've redefined success as 'fulfilling your soul's purpose.'": "Jack",
  "I don't want to have a relationship with someone if I'm not going to work with them.": "Bill",
  "I love my mom. My mom loves me. We don't have an easy relationship. I don't think we ever will, but I'd rather have a complicated, misunderstood relationship than have no relationship at all.": "Tori",
  "My husband and I have known each other since kindergarten. I had a crush on him in school, but we never dated. Then we saw each other again after high school, and there was something instantly familiar about him. I'm a very shy person and was very closed off. But he allowed me to be myself. And there's a safety in that.": "Alison",
  "My memory of my household is of one immersed in books and music. I have a very intimate relationship with Bengali literature, particularly Tagore, and my interest besides reading then was music.": "Siddhartha",
  "In any relationship, even when it came to my relationship with Usher, when it was time to make a move, I had to do that. I don't care how much my heart was hurting, sometimes you're just supposed to be with people for a reason, and it's not always a lifetime. Even if you want it to be, it just doesn't work out that way.": "Rozonda",
  "If Obama came by his liberalism in the faculty lounge, then sure, he can see it hasn't worked, and he can modify it. But if Obama got his formative ideas when he was very young, and if they are the result of his traumatic relationship with his father, then they are built into his psyche.": "Dinesh",
  "I've come to learn that what really matters is the relationship, the quality of the relationship.": "Tucker",
  "I love exploring the relationship between fathers and daughters. I think that's a special thing, especially with daughters who are dealing with being adults.": "Tim",
  "I was in New Zealand and met this girl. Her sister dared me to bungee jump, so I did! It was a spur-of-the-moment decision - I wanted to impress the girl, and it worked! We were in a relationship after that.": "Theo",
  "I believe that if you work hard at a relationship, devoting time and energy to it, being willing to grow and experiment, and never take it for granted, that you can continue to feel the initial attraction and excitement indefinitely.": "Sylvia",
  "I'm kind of a rebound junkie. So. when a relationship goes sour, I look at the sweetness in life elsewhere. So, I date a bit. The best catharsis is to write jokes and tell 4,000 people about it.": "Vir",
  "My father and I had a good relationship, it was very relaxed. He had a lot of humour. He looked a little bit like me, although he had no beard. He had the appearance of a very elegant British-looking man.": "Michael",
  "And it was a very, very fruitful and great relationship between the Stones and The Beatles. It was very, very friendly.": "Keith",
  "Whether it's a relationship or what you're wearing, or how much you weigh and what you said when you didn't mean it, like - it's hard to be totally under the microscope.": "Amy",
  "All of our great traditions, religious, contemplative and artistic, say that you must a learn how to be alone - and have a relationship with silence. It is difficult, but it can start with just the tiniest quiet moment.": "David",
  "Honesty lies in understanding our close and necessary relationship with not wanting to hear the truth.": "David",
  "Do you know that other than my father, I've never had a man take care of me?": "Dionne",
  "If money is the root of all evil, then China's manipulation of its currency, the yuan, is the tap root of everything wrong with the U.S.-China trade relationship.": "Peter",
  "I curate my life in a way. It's always playing on my mind, kind of a love-hate relationship. I'm not one of those people who's, like, 'I wish Facebook wasn't around,' because, you know, it is what it is.": "Lorde",
  "It's a very difficult thing losing a parent, but I think there's an added complication for me, because he was so well-loved and he had this very open charm that made people feel they had a personal relationship with him.": "Kate",
  "We run into some pretty tough arguments sometimes, but the idea is that at the end of the day, my wife and I realize that we'll always be holding each other's hand. This is a lifelong relationship, and after 12 years she hasn't gotten rid of me yet.": "Kyle",
  "Father's Day each year makes me grateful for what my father did for me. This has little to do with our relationship, and much to do with what he taught me.": "Karen",
  "I think there's a big difference between loving someone out of duty and dependency and loving someone because you really are able to sort of grow and be whole in the context of that relationship.": "Alexandra",
  "For the most part, that message hasn't changed a lot over the years - love is still love, and heartbreak is still heartbreak.": "Casey",
  "Care is a state in which something does matter it is the source of human tenderness. ": "Rollo",
  "Being flirty is a way of letting a guy know you're interested without making a fool out of yourself.": "Carmen",
  "I know that life is really finding the right relationship between yourself and God.": "Tom",
  "I think I learned about the relationship between books and life from Margaret Mitchell.": "Pat",

  "In a relationship you want to treat people the way you want to be treated.": "Bradley",
  "The formula for achieving a successful relationship is simple: you should treat all disasters as if they were trivialities but never treat a triviality as if it were a disaster.": "Quentin",
  "The fashion industry now has a direct relationship with its customers. Thanks to things like Twitter, ideas can be shared and circulated.": "Stefano",
  "The most important thing as a leader is your relationship with God.": "Manny",
  "Is our desire for partnership just an evolutionary remainder, a Togetherness Delusion, where millions of women only think they need a relationship to be truly happy? Maybe. But you know what? That's fine with me.": "Tracy",
  "An organization's reason for being, like that of any organism, is to help the parts that are in relationship to each other, to be able to deal with change in the environment.": "Kevin",
  "There was a whole language that I could never make function for myself in relationship to painting and that was attitudes like tortured, struggle, pain.": "Robert",
  "A relationship is hard in and of itself. And having kids is really hard work, but I think it's really meaningful, as is a relationship. But they all take work.": "Joan",
  "Royalties are not how most writers or musicians make their living. Musicians by and large make a living with a relationship with an audience that is economically harnessed through performance and ticket sales.": "John",
  "Fans believe they have a relationship with you, either through your TV character or, more reasonably, through the tweets you may have exchanged. In a way, you have gotten to know them. You learn about people's kids, families, pets.": "Gina",
  "You can't raise the aspirations of a child and then leave them hanging. Poverty can't be solved by a project. It's solved by a relationship, collaboration.": "Ann",
  "Everybody needs somebody.": "Mahalia",

  "I'm a Fritos Burrito guy. Me and Taco Bell have a love relationship on Twitter; they follow me. Out of 16 people they follow me, so I'm very loyal to my girlfriend, Taco Bell.": "Jacob",
  "It's quite a pure relationship, designer and muse. I think a beautiful dress on the wrong woman could mean nothing. It has to be the right woman and the right clothes. That's why you need that personal touch.": "Jason",
  "I think a lot of people still fantasise about that first love and what might happen if they rekindled the relationship.": "Sophie",
  "I eventually made the reunion with my father that I'd used as a default daydream throughout my childhood, but by then, we'd both outgrown the only relationship we could have had to each other. I was over 30 by the time I met him again and no longer needed a father.": "Mona",
  "I consider my relationship with acting in Hollywood as sort of a mutual breakup. Through puberty, Hollywood didn't really want me anymore, and I was like, 'Yeah, I don't really want you, either.'": "Mara",
  "I honestly believe you can never tell if a relationship is going to last. In my own marriage, which is going on 14 years, I don't think of it as 'I'm going to be with this person forever.' Instead, I think of more like, 'I'll probably be with this person for the next six weeks. Then I'll re-evaluate.'": "Michael",
  "You show your vulnerability through relationships, and those feelings are your soft spot. You need to have a soft spot.": "Victoria",
  "If you are strong enough as a couple, reality shows can be a good thing for the relationship.": "Giuliana",

  "I think to make any relationship work it just takes a tremendous amount of effort and accepting of one another.": "Rebecca",
  "Men should only believe half of what women say. But which half?": "Jean",
  "Yes, I don't believe that the inter-Korean relationship has, quote, 'deteriorated' since I assumed office. Rather I believe that the relationship between the two Koreas is entering into a new phase - a time of transition. And so I think that the North Koreans are trying to see what they can build with this, with my new administration.": "Lee",
  "I couldn't be in a relationship and behave like somebody else or pretend I felt something I didn't feel. And that includes saying things I thought might jeopardize the relationship.": "Kenny",
  "There's no shortage of orphans in 19th-century literature, but it's hard to find a single happy, communicative, functional parental relationship in the whole of 'Great Expectations,' even among the minor characters.": "David",
  "I don't know if there is a 'lack' of good black men. But when you haven't taken the time to get to know yourself, be OK with you, and articulate what it is you want in a relationship, then you can't possibly find that person for you because you don't even know what you're looking for.": "Keshia",
  "My ideal relationship with the reader is that at certain points they will have said, 'I'm finding this quite tough, but I'm going to hang in there,' then at the end they will say, 'Oh God, I'm glad I hung on, it was so worth it.'": "Sebastian",
  "We all have something about ourselves that we'd change if we could in a perfect world, be it our body image, our financial status, our relationship, whatever. I wanted to talk about how nobody's exempted from the realities of life and all those things.": "Keri",
  "I am not possessive at all. In every relationship I have had, the girl has left me. And the fundamental complaint has been that I am self-contained. I am just comfortable with myself and am always on an adventure.": "Shekhar",
  "Every relationship I've been in becomes long-distance because of work. It's never worked out. It puts an intense strain on the relationship, and at a certain point, it becomes too difficult.": "Anton",
  "If a relationship is founded on love it doesn't end.": "Rosanne",
  "I always felt sorry for the sidekick as a kid. They never got their due and it left a very bad taste in the mouth - they are defined by a subordinate relationship to someone else. I always felt like a bit of sidekick when I was a kid and it didn't feel fair.": "China",
  "The grief of losing my father has come in waves over the years, as it does with most people. His love and devotion as a father provided my closest, most intimate relationship. Dad, and our time together, is in my bones. While reflecting on him, the memories themselves seem to boil down into certain 'essences of Dad.'": "Jennifer",
  "What I learned from directing, I learned from soccer, where it's like a coach-player relationship.": "Sean",
  "The Thames could be thought of as England's longest archaeological site, and no fewer than 90,000 objects recovered from its foreshore are in the collection of the Museum of London, whose 30-year relationship with London mudlarks is both committed and highly regulated.": "Jean",
  "When I sit down to write a novel, I am exploring my own relationship with God, with the struggle between good and evil, my own purpose.": "Ted",
  "The value of government to the people it serves is in direct relationship to the interest citizens themselves display in the affairs of state.": "William",
  "The relationship with the words someone uses is more intimate and integrated than just a quick read and a blurb can ever be. This intimacy - the words on the page being sent back and forth from engaged editor to open author - is unique in my experience.": "Alice",
  "And harmony means that the relationship between all the elements used in a composition is balanced, is good.": "Karlheinz",
  "A Bush Administration will, I believe, enjoy a better relationship with the new Congress, although President-elect Bush will be faced with real challenges in getting along with the Congress.": "Richard",

  "I wish I had a great relationship with my mother.": "Chely",
  "When you're watching television, you don't want to watch a show where everything just works out. You don't want to see a relationship that's just blossoming and everyone's happy and sunshine and roses all the time. That's also not true in life.": "Candice",
  "I think that the two of them have been doing this for a really long time and it is more like sport. Yes, they would love to find a lasting relationship, but it's not likely to happen the way they are going about it.": "Jennifer",
  "I think it's healthy for couples to be away from each other for short periods.": "Liv",
  "I don't think it's necessarily healthy to go into relationships as a needy person. Better to go in with a full deck.": "Anjelica",
  "People who supported Obama felt like they formed a relationship, that they were being spoken to. The way that campaign worked and the way he's worked during his first term is to make people feel like he's grasping their hand, whether it's by tweeting or email, moments after an event, sometimes during an event. It makes people relate to him.": "James",
  "Nick and Simon had come to a natural end of their working relationship with Warren, which obviously opened the door for a reunion of the original five.": "Roger",
  "I'm attracted to how fraught the parent-child relationship is, swerving so easily between love and hostility, with almost no plausible way to end, unless someone dies.": "Ben",
  "The relationship between me and President Mandela right at the beginning was not a very well-established relationship. It was based on two meetings.": "F.",
  "Parents always stay older than you, but sibling sort of become adults together, and that complicates that relationship, I think.": "Carrie",
  "A lot of people reject the idea of God as Father if they've had a competitive relationship with their own father.": "Justin",
  "Till now I have never shot a scene without taking account of what stands behind the actors because the relationship between people and their surroundings is of prime importance.": "Michelangelo",
  "There's never been a game plan, and I suppose I've had an uneasy relationship with my ambition. Someone who had been in my year at drama school once said to me that I was terrifyingly ambitious back then. Which was not at all what I felt at the time - I felt paralysed with shyness, though that evaporated.": "Jennifer",
  "Writing a book is very personal. It's a very personal relationship. A book will start with something as simple as two men talking about work. That gets the fire going. Sustaining that fire is the hard work. It takes attention and empathy to hone the characters.": "Ron",
  "You are not alone with a guy until you are a proper age. You don't go to certain levels with men until you are married or you have a certain relationship.": "Daisy",
  "I really enjoy being single again. I spent a lot of time in a relationship and the nearer we came to the end, the more difficult it got. You don't see things clearly as long as you're still involved.": "Dido",
  "The one who loves the least, controls the relationship.": "Robert",
  "You can't stop loving or wanting to love because when its right it's the best thing in the world. When you're in a relationship and its good, even if nothing else in your life is right, you feel like your whole world is complete.": "Keith",
  "Nature is a dream state at this point, that we almost don't have a real relationship to it unless it's people living off the land and killing our own food and going for it.": "Catherine",
  "The Spirit is a kind of postmodern loner hero. He comes from nowhere he has no real relationship to anything. ": "David",

  "I am highly offended by the total lack of acknowledgement of my contribution to Laker success.": "Kareem",
  "I have no time for those who say there is no way Scotland could go it alone. I know first-hand the contribution Scotland and Scots make to Britain's success - so for me there's no question about whether Scotland could be an independent nation.": "David",
  "Success to me is having ten honeydew melons and eating only the top half of each slice.": "Barbra",
  "The common idea that success spoils people by making them vain, egotistic and self-complacent is erroneous; on the contrary it makes them, for the most part, humble, tolerant and kind.": "W.",
  "Success is survival.": "Leonard",
  "I feel like I want to take care of everyone and I also feel this terrible guilt if I am unable to. And I have felt this way ever since all this success started.": "Jim",
  "A lot of people don't have near the amount of success as I've been blessed to have, and it's all about working hard and hoping that continues.": "Luke",
  "As an actor there's a lot of scrutiny and, even when you've had success, it becomes about sustaining that success. A friend of mine described it as a peakless mountain. Even for De Niro there's Pacino and for Pacino there's De Niro.": "Eddie",
  "I'm extremely ambitious. I don't know why people are afraid to say that. I won't sell my soul to the devil, but I do want success and I don't think that's bad.": "Jada",
  "I feel lucky because I was a nerd, which I talk about in the book, but I had academic success, so through that, because that's what my parents put a great deal of value on, I had a great childhood because I sort of fulfilled the expectations of being good at school.": "Mindy",
  "I saw a lot of people have success handed to them that then exploited it. They didn't protect it or cherish it.": "Aaron",

  "It's our nature: Human beings like success but they hate successful people.": "Carrot",
  "When it comes to social consequences, they've got all different people acting in different ways, very difficult to even have a proper criterion of success. So, it's a difficult task.": "George",

  "Success is the space one occupies in the newspaper. Success is one day's insolence.": "Elias",
  "Success doesn't mean that you are healthy, success doesn't mean that you're happy, success doesn't mean that you're rested. Success really doesn't mean that you look good, or feel good, or are good.": "Victoria",
  "That's the key to success, isn't it? It has to be fun.": "Monica",
  "I'm still craving approval from my parents. It took a lot of success for me to realize it was never coming. It's just not in their nature.": "Andrew",
  "The success and the failure are not my concern, but His.": "Joseph",
  "Choose something you like to do. I know it's a cliche, and you've heard it over and over. But the reason is, you're going to have to work long and hard to achieve any success. You better like it or life is going to be terrible.": "Bill",

  "You've achieved success in your field when you don't know whether what you're doing is work or play.": "Warren",
  "People repeat behaviour that leads to flooding their brains with pleasurable chemicals. The short-term reward loop acts over hours to years, and the long-term reproductive success loop over generations.": "Keith",
  "Action leads to Attention. that in the short-term releases Rewarding brain chemicals and in the long term improves reproductive success.": "Keith",
  "I have gone from being a 21-year-old with wide eyes to a 24-year-old woman. With success comes a lot of responsibility and power.": "Vanessa",
  "My success is not due to any personal superiority over other people.": "John",
  "Every day of my life I walk with the idea that I am black, no matter how successful I am. And our success is tempered by that; you're successful in this way given the fact you are black, and most blacks don't get to that point.": "Danny",
  "Instead of this confusion, we need the unifying force of an official language, English, which is the language of success in America.": "Ernest",
  "If people ask me for the ingredients of success, I say one is talent, two is stubbornness or determination, and third is sheer luck. You have to have two out of the three. Any two will probably do.": "Fred",

  "In a balanced organization, working towards a common objective, there is success.": "Arthur",
  "But the best teams I've encountered have one important thing in common: their team structure and processes cover a full range of distinct competencies necessary for success.": "Jesse",
  "I want to make sure I don't interfere with the success of that team next year. I don't see any way I could go to practice like most of 'em do, and not hurt the team. I'd go nuts if I tried doing that.": "Bear",

  "A poet is a nightingale, who sits in darkness and sings to cheer its own solitude with sweet sounds.": "Percy",
  "As things are, and as fundamentally they must always be, poetry is not a career, but a mug's game. No honest poet can ever feel quite sure of the permanent value of what he has written: He may have wasted his time and messed up his life for nothing.": "T.",

The stranger is an archetype in epic poetry, in novels. The tension between alienation and assimilation has always been a basic theme.": "Jhumpa",
  "When it comes to atoms, language can be used only as in poetry. The poet, too, is not nearly so concerned with describing facts as with creating images.": "Niels",
  "Poetry, even when apparently most fantastic, is always a revolt against artifice, a revolt, in a sense, against actuality.": "James",

  "Poetry is the lifeblood of rebellion, revolution, and the raising of consciousness.": "Alice",
  "I'm a great believer in poetry out of the classroom, in public places, on subways, trains, on cocktail napkins. I'd rather have my poems on the subway than around the seminar table at an MFA program.": "Billy",

  "Cotton was a force of nature. There's a poetry to it, hoeing and growing cotton.": "B.",
  "Daydreaming is one of the key sources of poetry - a poem often starts as a daydream that finds its way into language - and walking seems to bring a different sort of alertness, an associative kind of thinking, a drifting state of mind.": "Edward",
  "Poetry is not a matter of feelings, it is a matter of language. It is language which creates feelings.": "Umberto",
  "Hip-hop is about the brilliance of pavement poetry.": "Michael",
  "If you have so earth-creeping a mind that it cannot lift itself up to look to the sky of poetry... thus much curse I must send you, in the behalf of all poets, that while you live, you live in love, and never get favour for lacking skill of a sonnet; and, when you die, your memory die from the earth for want of an epitaph.": "Philip",
  "Poetry should... should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.": "John",
  "Poetry is language at its most distilled and most powerful.": "Rita",
  "We go to poetry, we go to literature in general, to be forwarded within ourselves.": "Seamus",
  "Poetry is the one place where people can speak their original human mind. It is the outlet for people to say in public what is known in private.": "Allen",
  "Listen, real poetry doesn't say anything; it just ticks off the possibilities. Opens all doors. You can walk through any one that suits you.": "Jim",
  "It may be said that poems are in one way like icebergs: only about a third of their bulk appears above the surface of the page.": "Howard",
  "A poet's work is to name the unnameable, to point at frauds, to take sides, start arguments, shape the world, and stop it going to sleep.": "Salman",
  "Poetry is thoughts that breathe, and words that burn.": "Thomas",
  "Poetry is emotion, passion, love, grief - everything that is human. It is not for zombies by zombies.": "F.",
  "America's liberal arts universities have long been safe zones for leftist thinking, protected ivory towers for the pseudo-elite who earn their livings writing papers nobody reads about gender roles in the poetry of Maya Angelou.": "Ben",
  "I gave up on new poetry myself 30 years ago when most of it began to read like coded messages passing between lonely aliens in a hostile world.": "Russell",
  "Nobody, I think, ought to read poetry, or look at pictures or statues, who cannot find a great deal more in them than the poet or artist has actually expressed. Their highest merit is suggestiveness.": "Nathaniel",
  "Poetry is the art of substantiating shadows, and of lending existence to nothing.": "Edmund",
  "I know some people might think it odd - unworthy even - for me to have written a cookbook, but I make no apologies. The U.S. poet laureate Billy Collins thought I had demeaned myself by writing poetry for Hallmark Cards, but I am the people's poet so I write for the people.": "Maya",
  "There are still many tribal cultures where poetry and song, there is just one word for them. There are other cultures with literacy where poetry and song are distinguished. But poetry always remembers that it has its origins in music.": "Edward",
  "I have not the slightest pretension to call my verses poetry I write now and then for no other purpose than to relieve depression or to improve my English. ": "Alfred",
  "Sri Lanka is an island that everyone loves at some level inside themselves. A very special island that travellers, from Sinbad to Marco Polo, dreamed about. A place where the contours of the land itself forms a kind of sinewy poetry.": "Romesh",
  "If what distinguishes us from other species is speech, then poetry, which is the supreme linguistic operation, is our anthropological - indeed, genetic - goal.": "Joseph",
  "I cannot speak for more than an hour exclusively about poetry. At that point, life itself takes over again.": "Wislawa",
  "Spoken word poetry is the art of performance poetry. I tell people it involves creating poetry that doesn't just want to sit on paper, that something about it demands it be heard out loud or witnessed in person.": "Sarah",
  "Poetry is what we do to break bread with the dead.": "Seamus",
  "The poets have been mysteriously silent on the subject of cheese.": "Gilbert",

  "A poem is never finished, only abandoned.": "Paul",
  "I have been enlightened. I have fallen into poetry and it has swallowed me up.": "Keith",
  "The drama is complete poetry. The ode and the epic contain it only in germ; it contains both of them in a state of high development, and epitomizes both.": "Victor",
  "I consider myself a poet first and a musician second. I live like a poet and I'll die like a poet.": "Bob",

  "I still read Donne, particularly his love poems.": "Carol",
  "As human beings, we are the only organisms that create for the sheer stupid pleasure of doing so. Whether it's laying out a garden, composing a new tune on the piano, writing a bit of poetry, manipulating a digital photo, redecorating a room, or inventing a new chili recipe - we are happiest when we are creating.": "Gary",
  "The genesis of a poem for me is usually a cluster of words. The only good metaphor I can think of is a scientific one: dipping a thread into a supersaturated solution to induce crystal formation. I don't think I solve problems in my poetry I think I uncover the problems. ": "Margaret",
  "I've written some poetry I don't understand myself.": "Carl",
  "Poetry is a sword of lightning, ever unsheathed, which consumes the scabbard that would contain it.": "Percy",
  "Drawing is a way of coming upon the connection between things, just like metaphor in poetry reconnects what has become separated.": "John",
  "Poetry begins where language starts: in the shadows and accidents of one person's life.": "Eavan",
  "I have been writing poetry for a long time now. I started writing in my school days.": "Kapil",
  "The true spirit of delight, the exaltation, the sense of being more than Man, which is the touchstone of the highest excellence, is to be found in mathematics as surely as poetry.": "Bertrand",
  "Most people read poetry listening for echoes because the echoes are familiar to them. They wade through it the way a boy wades through water, feeling with his toes for the bottom: The echoes are the bottom.": "Wallace",
  "Poetry should help, not only to refine the language of the time, but to prevent it from changing too rapidly.": "T.",
  "The only thing that can save the world is the reclaiming of the awareness of the world. That's what poetry does.": "Allen",
  "Poetry is not an expression of the party line. It's that time of night, lying in bed, thinking what you really think, making the private world public, that's what the poet does.": "Allen",
  "We make out of the quarrel with others, rhetoric, but of the quarrel with ourselves, poetry.": "William",
  "I don't think you get to good writing unless you expose yourself and your feelings. Deep songs don't come from the surface; they come from the deep down. The poetry and the songs that you are suppose to write, I believe are in your heart.": "Judy",
  "Theater and poetry were what helped people stay alive and want to go on living.": "Vanessa",
  "Poetry involves the mysteries of the irrational perceived through rational words.": "Vladimir",
  "In poetry, you must love the words, the ideas and the images and rhythms with all your capacity to love anything at all.": "Wallace",

  "Poetry is as precise a thing as geometry.": "Gustave",
  "I'm sorry, man, but I've got magic. I've got poetry in my fingertips. Most of the time - and this includes naps - I'm an F-18, bro. And I will destroy you in the air. I will deploy my ordinance to the ground.": "Charlie",
  "In the language of poetry, where every word is weighed, nothing is usual or normal. Not a single stone and not a single cloud above it. Not a single day and not a single night after it. And above all, not a single existence, not anyone's existence in this world.": "Wislawa",
  "You know, people speak in poetry all the time. They just don't realize it.": "Sherman",
  "I don't think I've ever read poetry, ever.": "Eminem",

  "It is certain that at certain times talent entirely overcomes thought or poetry.": "John",
  "If you've ever been to a poetry slam, you know that the highest scoring emotion is self-righteous indignation: how dare you judge me. So in that way, the poem, 'What Teachers Make,' is an absolutely formulaic slam poem designed to allow me to get up on my soap box and say, 'Let me tell you what really makes me angry.'": "Taylor",
  "When I rap, I get to express myself in a way where putting words together is like poetry, and sometimes it's better to talk in certain expressions than sing, you know? So I love, I love to rhyme when I want to express certain things.": "Wyclef",
  "I don't think I've ever read poetry, ever. I'm not really book-smart.": "Eminem",
  "I think it's often assumed that the role of poetry is to comfort, but for me, poetry is the great unsettler. It questions the established order of the mind. It is radical, by which I don't mean that it is either leftwing or rightwing, but that it works at the roots of thinking.": "Alice",
  "If poetry and the arts do anything, they can fortify your inner life, your inwardness.": "Seamus",
  "Everybody interprets things differently with their own perception, and I want poetry to pull out of them their own feelings.": "John",
  "Poetry, at its best, is the language your soul would speak if you could teach your soul to speak.": "Jim",

  "Music has a poetry of its own, and that poetry is called melody.": "Joshua",
  "People wish to be poets more than they wish to write poetry, and that's a mistake. One should wish to celebrate more than one wishes to be celebrated.": "Lucille",
  "If there's no money in poetry, neither is there poetry in money.": "Robert",
  "I guess I wanted to leave America for awhile. It wasn't that I wanted to become an expatriate, or just never come back, I needed some breathing room. I'd already been translating French poetry, I'd been to Paris once before and liked it very much, and so I just went.": "Paul",
  "The music just tends to be a vehicle for that poetry.": "Mark",
  "Literature is a state of culture, poetry is a state of grace, before and after culture.": "Juan",
  "I think the first time I really heard poetry was in the schoolyard. Just the little limericks that kids say when they're jumping rope and playing games. I think that's the first time I heard rhyming words - I don't know if I'd call that the definitive poetry, but that's when I heard rhyming words said and not necessarily sung.": "Jill",
  "What are the sources of poetry? Love and death and the paradox of love and death. All poetry from the beginning is about Eros and Thanatos. Those are the only subjects. And how Eros and Thanatos interweave.": "Erica",
  "More modern poetry is written than read.": "P.",
  "Poetry at its best can do you a lot of harm.": "Sylvia",
  "Jazz and poetry both involve a structure that may be familiar and to some extent predictable. And then, you try to create as much surprise and spontaneity and feeling and variation while respecting that structure.": "Robert",
  "I was raised on songs of poetry like Simon and Garfunkel and Cat Stevens and Neil Young, etc. I love those old songs probably the most because they hit me so deep down in my core.": "Jessica",
  "When you write, it's just a much more crystalline, compressed version of the voice you think with - though not the one you speak with. I think your writing voice is your laser-guided missile. It's the poetry part of you.": "Douglas",
  "Maya Angelou was the voice of three generations. Her poetry spanned our journey, chronicled our hearts and documented our struggles as we moved from the orations of Martin Luther King to the presidency of Barack Obama.": "Donna",
  "Poetry is the universal language which the heart holds with nature and itself. He who has a contempt for poetry, cannot have much respect for himself, or for anything else.": "William",
  "In the television age, the key distinction is between the candidate who can speak poetry and the one who can only speak prose.": "Richard",
  "I recently read that it's the left brain that does all that calculating, and the right brain that does the poetry. Somehow I've veered way towards the left. I've been doing it for years. Maybe I do art to balance it out.": "Jason",
  "When I was 18, I took a trip to Thailand with a friend. We stayed for a month. Bangkok was very raw for a teenager: there were no cellphones, no Internet, and the only music I had with me was this cassette by Liz Phair. I was writing a lot of poetry, and she embodied a talky style of songwriting that I found very accessible.": "Jenny",
  "In a way, Anglo-Saxon poetry cannot be translated.": "Seamus",
  "No poetry that I'm aware of, however bad or glorious, has ever left somebody a worse person than they were before they read it.": "Felix",
  "What my character is or how many jails I have lounged in, or wards or walls or wassails, how many lonely-heart poetry readings I have dodged, is beside the point. A man's soul or lack of it will be evident with what he can carve upon a white sheet of paper.": "Charles",
  "If the object of poetry is, to make men, then poetry is the heir of prophecy.": "Muhammad",
  "Living here on Earth, we breathe the rhythms of a universe that extends infinitely above us. When resonant harmonies arise between this vast outer cosmos and the inner human cosmos, poetry is born.": "Daisaku",
  "But I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language, his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.": "Chinua",
  "Alchemy is the art of far and near, and I think poetry is alchemy in that way. It's delightful to distort size, to see something that's tiny as though it were vast.": "Robert",
  "Poetry is not only a set of words which are chosen to relate to each other it is something which goes much further than that to provide a glimpse of our vision of the world. ": "Tahar",
  "Shakespeare was a man who wrote poetry. I'm a man who writes poetry. Why not compare yourself to the best?": "Jay-Z",
  "Poetry fettered, fetters the human race. Nations are destroyed or flourish in proportion as their poetry, painting, and music are destroyed or flourish.": "William",
  "It is time to get drunk! So as not to be the martyred slaves of Time, get drunk; get drunk without stopping! On wine, on poetry, or on virtue, as you wish.": "Charles",
  "I've written poetry since I was in the first grade, and it wasn't until I was a little bit older that I realized poetry could be put to music and become a song.": "Jordin",
  "I am two fools, I know, for loving, and for saying so in whining poetry.": "John",
  "I saw the gooseflesh on my skin. I did not know what made it. I was not cold. Had a ghost passed over? No, it was the poetry.": "Sylvia",

  "Poetry should surprise by a fine excess and not by singularity, it should strike the reader as a wording of his own highest thoughts, and appear almost a remembrance.": "John",
  "The reason why we do maths is because it's like poetry. It's about patterns, and that really turned me on. It made me feel that maths was in tune with the other things I liked doing.": "Marcus",
  "Let's detox our cluttered academic brain. That's what the poet does. People call it daydreaming, detoxing our minds and taking care of that clutter. It's being able to let in call letters from the poetry universe.": "Juan",
  "A poet must be a psychologist, but a secret one: he should know and feel the roots of phenomena but present only the phenomena themselves in full bloom or as they fade away.": "Ivan",
  "The poetry you read has been written for you, each of you - black, white, Hispanic, man, woman, gay, straight.": "Maya",
  "Poetry comes alive to me through recitation.": "Natalie",
  "A theology should be like poetry, which takes us to the end of what words and thoughts can do.": "Karen",
  "Poetry carries its history within it, and it is oral in origin. Its transmission was oral.": "James",
  "I am an artist, you understand? For me, a picture is like poetry. When you make art, this is not coming from an intellectual place. It's coming from the deep side of your unconscious, your soul.": "Alejandro",
  "Wanted: a needle swift enough to sew this poem into a blanket.": "Charles",
  "I do not see how a man can work on the frontiers of physics and write poetry at the same time. They are in opposition.": "Paul",
  "The thing about great poetry is we have no defenses against it.": "David",
  "I think the poetry that came out of Belfast, and especially the Queen's University set, in the 1970s and '80s - you know, Paul Muldoon and Seamus Heaney, Derek Mahon and Ciaran Carson - that was probably the finest body of work since the Gaelic renaissance, up there with the work of Yeats and Synge and Lady Gregory.": "Adrian",
  "I'm not really a musician. I'm a performer, and I love rock n' roll. I've embraced rock n' roll because it encompasses all the things I'm interested in: poetry, revolution, sexuality, political activism - all of these things can be found in rock n' roll.": "Patti",
  "I wish our clever young poets would remember my homely definitions of prose and poetry; that is, prose = words in their best order; - poetry = the best words in the best order.": "Samuel",
  "The poetry of a people comes from the deep recesses of the unconscious, the irrational and the collective body of our ancestral memories.": "Margaret",
  "Bleak House is just the most astounding piece of work. There's huge, visionary poetry in it.": "Simon",
  "Have you ever heard a good joke? If you've ever heard someone just right, with the right pacing, then you're already on the way to poetry. It's about using words in very precise ways and using gesture.": "Rita",
  "I love Sufism as I love beautiful poetry, but it is not the answer. Sufism is like a mirage in the desert. It says to you, come and sit, relax and enjoy yourself for a while.": "Naguib",
  "Poetry is the record of the best and happiest moments of the happiest and best minds.": "Percy",
  "Written poetry is worth reading once, and then should be destroyed. Let the dead poets make way for others.": "Antonin",
  "Poetry isn't a profession, it's a way of life. It's an empty basket; you put your life into it and make something out of that.": "Mary",
  "It's not easy to define poetry.": "Bob",
  "I don't like the word 'poetry,' and I don't like poetry readings, and I usually don't like poets. I would much prefer describing myself and what I do as: I'm kind of a curator, and I'm kind of a night-owl reporter.": "Tom",
  "I began writing early - very, very early... I was already writing short stories for the radio and selling poems to poetry and art festivals; I was involved in school plays; I wrote essays, so there was no definite moment when I said, 'Now I'm a writer.' I've always been a writer.": "Wole",
  "I've always written. There's a journal which I kept from about 9 years old. The man who gave it to me lived across the street from the store and kept it when my grandmother's papers were destroyed. I'd written some essays. I loved poetry, still do. But I really, really loved it then.": "Maya",
  "For an American, there's no automatic place where people love the art of poetry. There's not a social class that considers poetry its property the way in some countries there's a snob value to the art.": "Robert",
  "If I have to make a self-portrait, I would put poetry and rebellion on the list. To be able to walk on a wire, to be able to juggle six hoops, you need focus, another word for tenacity, which is passion.": "Philippe",
  "The Victorian language of flowers began with the publication of 'Le Language des Fleurs,' written by Charlotte de Latour and printed in Paris in 1819. To create the book - which was a list of flowers and their meanings - de Latour gathered references to flower symbolism throughout poetry, ancient mythology, and even medicine.": "Vanessa",
  "I have written some poetry and two prose books about baseball, but if I had been a rich man, I probably would not have written many of the magazine essays that I have had to do. But, needing to write magazine essays to support myself, I looked to things that I cared about and wanted to write about, and certainly baseball was one of them.": "Donald",
  "Poetry is one of the ancient arts, and it began as did all the fine arts, within the original wilderness of the earth.": "Mary",
  "I came into music because I thought the presentation of poetry wasn't vibrant enough. So I merged improvised poetry with basic rock chords. That was my original mission.": "Patti",
  "Like most lit nerds, I'm a voracious reader. I never got enough poetry under my belt growing up but I do read it - some of my favorites, Gina Franco and Angela Shaw and Cornelius Eady and Kevin Young, remind me daily that unless the words sing and dance, what's the use of putting them down on paper.": "Junot",
  "Each word bears its weight, so you have to read my poems quite slowly.": "Anne",
  "Superstition is the poetry of life.": "Johann",
  "I started off in England and very few people knew I was Australian. I mean, the clues were in the poems, but they didn't read them very carefully, and so for years and years I was considered completely part of the English poetry scene.": "Peter",
  "The Bible is not just one book, but an entire library, with stories, songs, poetry, letters and history, as well as literature that might more obviously qualify as 'religious.'": "John",
  "Human beings love poetry. They don't even know it sometimes... whether they're the songs of Bono, or the songs of Justin Bieber... they're listening to poetry.": "Maya",
  "If the poetry world celebrate its female stars at the true level of their productivity and influence, poetry would wind up being a largely female world, and the men would leave.": "Eileen",
  "'Therefore' is a word the poet must not know.": "Andre",
  "Any healthy man can go without food for two days - but not without poetry.": "Charles",
  "Poetry is the art of creating imaginary gardens with real toads.": "Marianne",
  "A poet can survive everything but a misprint.": "Oscar",
  "All bad poetry springs from genuine feeling.": "Oscar",
  "Poetry is ordinary language raised to the Nth power. Poetry is boned with ideas, nerved and blooded with emotions, all held together by the delicate, tough skin of words.": "Paul",
  "The crown of literature is poetry.": "W.",
  "A poet looks at the world the way a man looks at a woman.": "Wallace",
  "A poem might be defined as thinking about feelings - about human feelings and frailties.": "Anne",
  "He could not die when trees were green, for he loved the time too well.": "John",
  "There may be more poetry than justice in poetic justice.": "George",
  "There are men who can write poetry, and there are men who can read balance sheets. The men who can read balance sheets cannot write.": "Henry",
  "The blood jet is poetry and there is no stopping it.": "Sylvia",
  "I think that the job of poetry, its political job, is to refresh the idea of justice, which is going dead in us all the time.": "Robert",
  "Poetry is a sort of homecoming.": "Paul",
  "I didn't want to deal in poetry. I got rid of that after a few months.": "Tom",
  "Of course a poem is a two-way street. No poem is any good if it doesn't suggest to the reader things from his own mind and recollection that he will read into it, and will add to what the poet has suggested. But I do think poetry readings are very important.": "James",
  "Pound's translation of Chinese poetry was maybe the most important thing I read. Eliot a little bit later.": "Robert",
  "A group of us started a community center in Santa Monica. We've tried different programs, and three have worked really well. A poetry group. Once a week we visit Venice High and talk to girls at risk.": "Lisa",
  "Slowly poetry becomes visual because it paints images, but it is also musical: it unites two arts into one.": "Eugenio",
  "What we know is that Shakespeare wrote perhaps the most remarkable body of passionate love poetry in the English language to a young man.": "Stephen",
  "So, poetry becomes a means for useful dialogue between people who are not only unknown, but mute to each other. It produces a dialogue among people that guards all of us against manipulation by our so-called leaders.": "June",
  "Writing poetry makes you intensely conscious of how words sound, both aloud and inside the head of the reader. You learn the weight of words and how they sound to the ear.": "Helen",
  "I want a fever, in poetry: a fever, and tranquillity.": "James",
  "Why should poetry have to make sense?": "Charlie",
  "The poetry of this one is called philosophical, of that one philological, of a third rhetorical, and so on. Which is then the poetic poetry?": "Karl",
  "Yet, it is true, poetry is delicious; the best prose is that which is most full of poetry.": "Virginia",
  "The musician is perhaps the most modest of animals, but he is also the proudest. It is he who invented the sublime art of ruining poetry.": "Erik",
  "I see people who talk about America, and then undermine it by not paying attention to its soul, to its poetry. I see polarization, reductionism and superficiality.": "Azar",
  "I always wrote poetry and stuff like that, so putting songs together wasn't that spectacular.": "Amy",
  "When I hit a block, regardless of what I am writing, what the subject matter is, or what's going on in the plot, I go back and I read Pablo Neruda's poetry. I don't actually speak Spanish, so I read it translation. But I always go back to Neruda. I don't know why, but it calms me, calms my brain.": "Tea",
  "The middle class is doing fine in fiction. But it's not what gets me going. I love the working class, and everyone from it I've met, and think they're incredibly witty, inventive - there's a lot of poetry there.": "Martin",
  "I read poetry to save time.": "Marilyn",
  "The poetry and transgression that was so much of surrealism's anarchic force has been recruited into mainstream culture. It has been made commonplace by television and magazine merchandising, by computer games and Internet visuals, by film and MTV, by the fashion shoot.": "Graham",
  "Modernism in other arts brought extreme difficulty. In poetry, the characteristic difficulty imported under the name of modernism was obscurity. But obscurity could just as easily be a quality of metrical as of free verse.": "James",
  "Poetry, for me, is the answer to, 'How does one stay sane when private lives are being ransacked by public events?' It's something that hangs over your head all the time.": "Lisel",
  "Poetry is my cheap means of transportation. By the end of the poem the reader should be in a different place from where he started. I would like him to be slightly disoriented at the end, like I drove him outside of town at night and dropped him off in a cornfield.": "Billy",
  "I think of something quite different from a snapshot. I know of a lot of poems, some very fine ones, that are like snapshots, but I'm more interested in poetry that is like an endless film, long stories, things that weave together many different strands, like a big piece of cloth, not like a photograph.": "Robert",
  "As far as I am concerned, poetry is a statement concerning the human condition, composed in verse.": "N.",
  "My father loved poetry and music. But deep in himself he thought teaching the finest thing a person could do.": "George",
  "One night, I lay awake for hours, just terrified. When the dawn finally came up - the comfortable blue sky, the familiar world returning - I could think of no other way to express my relief than through poetry. I made a decision there and then that it was what I wanted to do. Every time I pulled a wishbone, it was what I asked for.": "Alice",
  "Poetry, fiction as novels or short stories - these are autonomous as created by their authors. They should stand on their own, like pieces of furniture that should be judged as to their usefulness, elegance.": "F.",
  "I am for poetry that is admired by peasant and aristocrat alike.": "F.",
  "For me, I used to be shy towards journalism because it wasn't poetry. And then I realized that the events that I covered in essays that became journalism were actually great because they inspired me, and they became my muse.": "Alice",
  "In Northern Ireland, helicopters are not usually used to promote poetry.": "Seamus",
  "I admire 'Adventure Time' for being a piece of art in the way that I think art should be. If you want to see it is poetry, you can, and if you don't, you can watch a fun cartoon.": "Rebecca",
  "When I was young, I read everything I could lay my hands on, but the Scots in my storybooks spent their time fighting glorious battles, rowing across lochs, or escaping over moors of purple heather. Even those Scots were hard to find. For at school, we recited poetry according to the set texts the teachers taught us.": "Theresa",
  "Surrealism is not a poetry but a poetics, and even more, and more decisively, a world vision.": "Octavio",
  "Many great works of art, poetry, and music are inspired by astral memories. The desire to do noble, beautiful things here on Earth is also often a carryover of astral experiences between a person's earth lives.": "Paramahansa",
  "I owe my discovery of the Hot Club of Cowtown to Kinky Friedman, leader of the Texas Jewboys. When I saw that Bob Wills and his Texas Playboys were headlining the 2003 Santa Clarita Cowboy Poetry and Music Festival, I thought it my duty to check out the band that had inspired the Texas Jewboys.": "Clive",
  "I like cups of tea and reading books and poetry and old people things.": "Bindi",
  "Poetry is a call to action, and it also is action.": "Juan",
  "The muse, the beloved, and duende are three ways of thinking of what is the source of poetry, and all three seem to me different names or different ways to think about something that is not entirely reasonable, not entirely subject to the will, not entirely rational.": "Edward",
  "In poetry, I have, since very young, loved poetry in translation. The Chinese, the French, the Russians, Italians, Indians and early Celts: the formality of the translator's voice, their measured breath and anxiety moves me as it lingers over the original.": "Fanny",
  "There is a gap in my work from '84 to 2002, 18 years where I stopped writing. I was working at fiction and other things and starting a school and getting married and starting a family, but I wasn't writing poetry for the better part of 15 years.": "Philip",
  "The major poets of New Jersey have all suffered, whether it's Whitman, who lost his job for 'Leaves of Grass,' or William Carlos Williams, who was called a communist, or Ginsberg, whose 'Howl' was prosecuted, or myself. If you practise poetry the way I think it needs to be done, you're going to put yourself in jeopardy.": "Amiri",
  "I do believe that we've a responsibility to try to acknowledge the range, both geographic and graphic, of what's happening in poetry in English. I'm interested in poems that are first-rate. After that, I'm not too concerned if they come from Queens or Queensland.": "Paul",
  "When I get depressed, I try to get something for the terrible sadness that comes over me and create something in terms of poetry.": "Spike",
  "The applause of his native land is the richest reward to which the patriot ever aspires. It is this for which 'he bears to live or dares to die.' It is the high incentive to those achievements which illustrate the page of history and give to poetry its brightest charm.": "John",
  "The topics just kind of come to me. If they are relevant, it's because they're happening in the world around me, and it's affecting me. Poetry is my way of dealing with it.": "Rupi",
  "There is no Frigate like a book to take us lands away nor any coursers like a page of prancing Poetry.": "Emily",
  "Money is a kind of poetry.": "Wallace",
  "Music begins to atrophy when it departs too far from the dance... poetry begins to atrophy when it gets too far from music.": "Ezra",
  "Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graver import than history, since its statements are rather of the nature of universals, whereas those of history are singulars.": "Aristotle",
  "The Bible should be taught, but emphatically not as reality. It is fiction, myth, poetry, anything but reality. As such it needs to be taught because it underlies so much of our literature and our culture.": "Richard",
  "Every now and then I read a poem that does touch something in me, but I never turn to poetry for solace or pleasure in the way that I throw myself into prose.": "J.",
  "Verse in itself does not constitute poetry. Verse is only an elegant vestment for a beautiful form. Poetry can express itself in prose, but it does so more perfectly under the grace and majesty of verse. It is poetry of soul that inspires noble sentiments and noble actions as well as noble writings.": "Victor",
  "I want to promote poetry to the point where you got all the baldhead kids running around doing poetry, getting the music out of the way and having only words, the spoken word, and then see what happens.": "Russell",
  "Anybody serious about poetry knows how hard it is to achieve anything worthwhile in it.": "Seamus",
  "Often people, when they're confronted with a poem, it's like someone who keep saying 'what is the meaning of this? What is the meaning of this?' And that dulls us to the other pleasures poetry offers.": "Billy",
  "Radio is such a perfect medium for the transmission of poetry, primarily because there just is the voice, there's no visual distraction.": "Billy",
  "I know my voice has a limited range of motion; I don't write dramatic monologues and pretend to be other people. But so far, my voice is broad enough to accommodate most of what I want to put into my poetry. I like my persona; I often wish I were him and not me.": "Billy",
  "Making poetry with a camera - that's the essence of what I do.": "Denis",
  "Poetry must have something in it that is barbaric, vast and wild.": "Denis",
  "Stylized acting and direction is to realistic acting and direction as poetry is to prose.": "Elia",
  "Instead of trying to come up and pontificate on what literature is, you need to talk with children, to teachers, and make sure they get poetry in the curriculum early.": "Rita",
  "The experience of poetry could bring my mother back to me. Poetry offers a different kind of solace - here on earth.": "Natasha",
  "I like to borrow forms and quotes and use a lot of allusions, in both poetry and music.": "Jamila",
  "Sunday is a likely day to write a poem. Because poetry is a piece of language flying around: you'll find notebooks, something on your phone. It's about finding them and getting them off that crumpled piece of paper and onto my computer.": "Eileen",
  "Poetry can tell us about what's going on in our lives - not only our personal but our social and political lives.": "Juan",
  "For this reason poets and artists developed the doctrine of Art for Art's Sake. The community did not appear to need them, so, tit for tat, they did not need the community. This being granted, it was no longer necessary or even desirable to make one's poetry either intelligible or sympathetic to the community.": "Louis",
  "Good poets have written in order to describe something or to preach something - with their eye on the object or the end. The essence of the poetry does not lie in the thing described or in the message imparted but in the resulting concrete unity, the poem.": "Louis",
  "I liked to write from the time I was about 12 or 13. I loved to read. And since I only spoke to my brother, I would write down my thoughts. And I think I wrote some of the worst poetry west of the Rockies. But by the time I was in my 20s, I found myself writing little essays and more poetry - writing at writing.": "Maya",
  "I wrote some of the worst poetry west from the Mississippi River, but I wrote. And I finally sometimes got it right.": "Maya",
  "I find in my poetry and prose the rhythms and imagery of the best - I mean, when I'm at my best - of the good Southern black preachers. The lyricism of the spirituals and the directness of gospel songs and the mystery of blues are in my music or in my poetry and prose, or I missed everything.": "Maya",
  "I'm happy to be a writer - of prose, poetry, every kind of writing. Every person in the world who isn't a recluse, hermit or mute uses words. I know of no other art form that we always use.": "Maya",
  "I think that there is nothing, not even crime, more opposed to poetry, to philosophy, ay, to life itself than this incessant business.": "Henry",
  "There's a love of rhetorical skill in the Muslim world. Osama bin Laden doesn't just go on tape cassettes and say, 'America sucks.' He recites poetry; he finds things that 'America sucks' rhymes with.": "P.",
  "It could be that all awful dictators are frustrated artists - Mao with his poetry and Mussolini with his monuments. Stalin was once a journalistic hack, and I can personally testify to how frustrated they are. Pol Pot left a very edgy photo collection behind. And Osama seems quite interested in video.": "P.",
  "I felt like my favorite writers have almost musical hooks in their work, whether it's poetry or a hook at the end of a chapter that makes you want to read the next one. And I think that my favorite writers definitely have something musical about what they do, in saying something so relatable and universal and so simple.": "Taylor",
  "Poetry and lyrics are very similar. Making words bounce off a page.": "Taylor",
  "We explore our environment, more than we are compelled to utter poetry, when we're toddlers. We start doing that later. Before that happens, every child is a scientist.": "Neil",
  "When Auden said his poetry didn't save one Jew from the gas chamber, he'd said it all.": "Tom",
  "Science arose from poetry... when times change the two can meet again on a higher level as friends.": "Johann",
  "You don't have to be a renowned artist like Q-Tip to try your hand at poetry. You don't need any special equipment - that's the beauty of it.": "Michelle",
  "Poetry has done enough when it charms, but prose must also convince.": "H.",
  "The Bible is very resonant. It has everything: creation, betrayal, lust, poetry, prophecy, sacrifice. All great things are in the Bible, and all great writers have drawn from it and more than people realise, whether Shakespeare, Herman Melville or Bob Dylan.": "Patti",
  "What I wanted to do in rock 'n roll was merge poetry with sonic scapes, and the two people who had contributed so much to that were Jimi Hendrix and Jim Morrison.": "Patti",
  "When I was younger, I felt it was my duty to wake people up. I thought poetry was asleep. I thought rock 'n' roll was asleep.": "Patti",
  "I didn't love Jim Morrison 'cause he was self-destructive. I loved him because of his work. Because of the way he merged poetry and rock-and-roll. Because he did something new.": "Patti",
  "Rhyme, that enslaved queen, that supreme charm of our poetry, that creator of our meter.": "Victor",
  "In the French language, there is a great gulf between prose and poetry; in English, there is hardly any difference. It is a splendid privilege of the great literary languages Greek, Latin, and French that they possess a prose. English has not this privilege. There is no prose in English.": "Victor",
  "Writing criticism is to writing fiction and poetry as hugging the shore is to sailing in the open sea.": "John",
  "I must say, when I reread myself, it's the poetry I tend to look at. It's the most exciting to write, and it's over the quickest.": "John",
  "Art works because it appeals to certain faculties of the mind. Music depends on details of the auditory system, painting and sculpture on the visual system. Poetry and literature depend on language.": "Steven",
  "The fact that Newark is having poetry festivals and peace conferences - all of these things are building an undeniable thesis that our city is making incredible strides forward.": "Cory",
  "On the subject of literary genres, I've always felt that my response to poetry is inadequate. I'd love to be the kind of person that drifts off into the garden with a slim volume of Elizabethan verse or a sheaf of haikus, but my passion is story.": "J.",
  "As an actor, there is room for a certain amount of creativity, but you're always ultimately going to be saying somebody else's words. I don't think I'd have the stamina, skill or ability to write a novel, but I'd love to write short stories and poetry, because those are my two passions.": "Daniel",
  "I don't think I'd have the stamina, skill or ability to write a novel, but I'd love to write short stories and poetry, because those are my two passions.": "Daniel",
  "On a practical level, poetry isn't something anybody has really made a great living at. I might sell some books and, once in a while, someone might pay to hear me read.": "Viggo",
  "Photography, painting or poetry - those are just extensions of me, how I perceive things; they are my way of communicating.": "Viggo",
  "I have a publishing company of books by me and books of others. It drew people to poetry readings and photo exhibitions and painting exhibitions that I've been doing for years before that.": "Viggo",
  "I've been reading poetry publicly for 20 years, and this is what you do - you express, you sometimes dig a bit to get a conversation started. That's the point of poetry. You're supposed to go, 'Hmmmm,' and 'Woooh!'": "Jill",
  "I was reading poetry to my girlfriends, and they were like, 'You're really good. You should go to some poetry readings or something.' And I eventually went and got a, you know, somewhat of a name for myself and a little bit of a following.": "Jill",
  "The claims I'm making for art are simply the claims that we naturally make around music or around poetry. We're much more relaxed around those art forms. We're willing to ask, 'How could this find a place in my heart?'": "Alain",
  "Dylan captured what was on a million minds and turned it into poetry. With 'Blowin' in the Wind' or 'The Times They Are A-Changin',' he set a whole new standard.": "Jimmy",
  "Existential philosophy, poetry and art - just like sadness - were all unavoidable to a tender young man in the meat works.": "Michael",
  "When I am writing fiction, I believe I am much better organized, more methodical - one has to be when writing a novel. Writing poetry is a state of free float.": "Margaret",
  "I don't think of poetry as a 'rational' activity but as an aural one. My poems usually begin with words or phrases which appeal more because of their sound than their meaning, and the movement and phrasing of a poem are very important to me.": "Margaret",
  "Americans have been tremendously fortunate in poetry, regarding both the quantity and quality of poetry produced. Unfortunately, it remains in schools and universities; it is not widely distributed.": "Joseph",
  "Poetry is rather an approach to things, to life, than it is typographical production.": "Joseph",
  "Poetry seems to be the only weapon able to beat language, using language's own means.": "Joseph",
  "To translate poetry, one has to possess some art, at the very least the art of stylistic re-embodiment.": "Joseph",
  "The more one reads poetry, the less tolerant one becomes of any sort of verbosity, be that in political or philosophical discourse, be that in history, social studies or the art of fiction.": "Joseph",
  "My idea is simply - is very simple - is that the books of poetry should be published in far greater volume and be distributed in far greater volume, in far more substantial manner. You can sell in supermarkets very cheaply. In paperbacks. You can sell in drugstores.": "Joseph",
  "This assumption that the blue collar crowd is not supposed to read it, or a farmer in his overalls is not to read poetry, seems to be dangerous if not tragic.": "Joseph",
  "I am a patriot, but I must say that English poetry is the richest in the world.": "Joseph",
  "Poetry is not an art or a branch of art: it's something more.": "Joseph",
  "Anyone who regards poetry as an entertainment, as a 'read,' commits an anthropological crime, in the first place against himself.": "Joseph",
  "American poetry to me is a sort of relentless, nonstop sermon on human autonomy.": "Joseph",
  "Tyranny will make an entire population into readers of poetry.": "Joseph",
  "American poetry is this country's greatest patrimony. It takes a stranger to see some things clearly. This is one of them, and I am that stranger.": "Joseph",
  "Poetry isn't just different from prose, it's more important for the human species.": "Joseph",
  "The charge frequently leveled against poetry - that it is difficult, obscure, hermetic and whatnot - indicates not the state of poetry but, frankly, the rung of the evolutionary ladder on which society is stuck.": "Joseph",
  "People who buy 'The National Enquirer' would buy poetry. They should be given a choice. I'm absolutely serious.": "Joseph",
  "People compose poetry, novels, sitcoms - for love.": "Helen",
  "Being able to say something lyrically, to say something that will do more than just be words, is really hard. It's easy to do when you're writing a chapter of a book or writing poetry, but it's really hard to do when you're confined to a melody line.": "Nikki",
  "That metre itself forms an essential part of all true poetry is a principle which not even the assertions of an Aristotle or the pronouncements of a Plato can disestablish.": "H.",
  "When you are writing literary writing, you are communicating something subtextual with emotions and poetry. The prose has to have a voice; it's not just typing. It takes a while to get that voice.": "Joyce",
  "I'm moved by people who see the world differently than others. People who see the world with a longing for its poetry often can be broken people.": "Laura",
  "For awhile after you quit Keats all other poetry seems to be only whistling or humming.": "F.",
  "What is beautiful enchants me. I mean not just physical beauty but a wider concept of beauty. There is beauty in poetry and in great musical or singing performances. There is beauty everywhere if you can just see it.": "Andrea",
  "Personally I always feel like I could use a little more of poetry apothegmatic power in my own work but we're always lacking something.": "Junot",
  "I didn't start writing songs, honestly, until I started making my album. I was always doing poetry, but I never thought I could write songs. I discouraged myself and thought it was so hard. But starting this process and learning just what it is to be a songwriter and performer taught me that you don't have to feel discouraged about anything.": "Alessia",
  "In much of computer science, I can easily 'auto-grade' your work and give you an instant meaningful feedback. I can't do this when it comes to the subtlety of human thought, language, poetry, philosophy.": "Sebastian",
  "I want to branch out. I want to write. I write poetry. I want to see my children grow up well.": "Annie",
  "Poetry is all that is worth remembering in life.": "William",
  "Shakespeare is rhythmic; he is musical in the sense that he likes poetry, and he's musical because he constantly refers to settings where there's singing and dancing.": "Kenneth",
  "Maybe it is something to do with age, but I have become fonder of poetry than of prose.": "Aung",
  "I love reading poetry, and yet, at this point, the thought of writing a poem, to me, is tantamount to figuring out a trigonometry question.": "Jhumpa",
  "It's just poetry, beauty and love. How hard can that be to act?": "Robin",
  "I certainly derived my skills as a prose writer from my scrutiny of poetry and of the individual word. But schools don't do things like that anymore - tracking words down to their roots.": "Camille",
  "When the poet is in love, he is incapable of writing poetry on love. He has to write when he remembers that he was in love.": "Umberto",
  "I have felt great advances in my poetry, the main one being a growing victory over word nuances and a superfluity of adjectives.": "Sylvia",
  "Well, I still write poetry, but I wouldn't call myself a poet.": "David",
  "Well you can't teach the poetry, but you can teach the craft.": "David",
  "I went through a phase of reading lots of Urdu poetry, thanks to the great transliterated versions that have become available.": "Satya",
  "No poems can please for long or live that are written by water drinkers.": "Horace",
  "The greatest thing a human soul ever does in this world... to see clearly is poetry, prophecy and religion all in one.": "John",
  "There's poetry in being the band that can sell out Wembley but also makes a record in a garage. I don't like doing what people expect me to do.": "Dave",
  "I've read a lot of war writing, even World War I writing, the British war poetry of Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon, Robert Graves's memoir 'Goodbye to All That,' and a civilian memoir, 'Testament of Youth,' by Vera Brittain.": "George",
  "You pick up loads of baggage with your first record with reaction to it from fans and critics. So I went to Ireland by myself for a couple of weeks with my guitar. I read lots of poetry, I read Patti Smith's autobiography and started words and phrases and then songs started to take shape.": "Ellie",
  "When I was in college, I really liked poetry. I don't read much anymore.": "Steve",
  "I want to write a play. I'd like to do an original musical. I should probably put together a poetry collection.": "Neil",
  "We are supposed to write poetry to keep the gods alive.": "Jim",
  "I think poetry is able to say things in such a small, perfect way that are so hard to say. I think it's a perfect medium for expressing difficult ideas and concepts and feelings. It's one of my great loves.": "Jerry",
  "I find a lot of poetry to be narcissistic.": "Joni",
  "Poetry consists in a rhyming dictionary and things seen.": "Gertrude",
  "Poetry has, in a way, been my bridge to my acting career.": "Omari",
  "I found poetry at 12 and 13 and, lo and behold, learned that my attorney father had a background in poetry - as he wore dashikis and Afros in the '70s and named his kids Arabic names. He was a poet and a lot like The Last Poets and Gil Scott-Heron and all of these folks. He definitely was an artist.": "Omari",
  "I was trying to pay the bills with poems, and it was easy to memorize my poems, because I'd be riding my bike in California trying to memorize them before going on stage at a poetry lounge.": "Omari",
  "That's the thing with me being a former athlete: in the way I attack characters and attack poetry is from the base of being an athlete.": "Omari",
  "Poetry is almost like my foundation for everything. I almost feel I am a better actor and writer because of it.": "Omari",
  "The fact of the matter is that the most unexpected and miraculous thing in my life was the arrival in it of poetry itself - as a vocation and an elevation almost.": "Seamus",
  "Nowadays, what an award gives is a sense of solidarity with the poetry guild, as it were: sustenance coming from the assent of your peers on the judging panel.": "Seamus",
  "I credit poetry for making this space-walk possible.": "Seamus",
  "Manifesting that order of poetry where we can at last grow up to that which we stored up as we grew.": "Seamus",
  "Dylan Thomas is now as much a case history as a chapter in the history of poetry.": "Seamus",
  "A public expectation, it has to be said, not of poetry as such but of political positions variously approvable by mutually disapproving groups.": "Seamus",
  "The completely solitary self: that's where poetry comes from, and it gets isolated by crisis, and those crises are often very intimate also.": "Seamus",
  "Poetry is always slightly mysterious, and you wonder what is your relationship to it.": "Seamus",
  "The experimental poetry thing is not my thing. It's a programme of the avant-garde: basically a refusal of the kind of poetry I write.": "Seamus",
  "The experiment of poetry, as far as I am concerned, happens when the poem carries you beyond where you could have reasonably expected to go.": "Seamus",
  "In the United States, in poetry workshops, it's now quite a thing to make graduate students learn poems by heart.": "Seamus",
  "In poetry, everything can be faked but the intensity of utterance.": "Seamus",
  "Tom Sleigh's poetry is hard-earned and well founded. I great admire the way it refuses to cut emotional corners and yet achieves a sense of lyric absolution.": "Seamus",
  "Poetry is a domestic art, most itself when most at home.": "Seamus",
  "Poetry is more a threshold than a path.": "Seamus",
  "A play is basically a long, formalistic polemic. You can write it without the poetry, and if you do, you may have a pretty good play. We know this because we see plays in translation. Not many people speak Norwegian or Danish or whatever guys like Ibsen spoke, or Russian - yet we understand Chekhov and the others.": "David",
  "It's always a combination of physics and poetry that I find inspiring. It's hard to wrap your head around things like the Hubble scope.": "Tom",
  "There isn't, even now, a great tradition of novel-writing in Afghanistan. Most of the literature is in the form of poetry.": "Khaled",
  "I learn poetry, learn text, and that really keeps you alive.": "Anthony",
  "Metaphorical tone deafness is when people are unable to discern what is of value in something. I think I'm tone deaf to poetry, for instance. Despite having studied it into a second year of university, most of it just leaves me cold.": "Julian",
  "It would probably surprise people to know that I'm interested in wildlife. I read a lot of poetry, too.": "Sean",
  "Poetry and progress are like two ambitious men who hate one another with an instinctive hatred, and when they meet upon the same road, one of them has to give place.": "Charles",
  "France is not poetic; she even feels, in fact, a congenital horror of poetry. Among the writers who use verse, those whom she will always prefer are the most prosaic.": "Charles",
  "In traditional Asian arts, the word and the picture always sit next to each other. I have an aunt, a Chinese brush painter, who told me that when you do a Chinese brush painting, you have to pair the image up with some poetry.": "Gene",
  "Whether you like modern incarnations of what country radio hits are, or you like what I'm doing, or you like something really off in folk, poetry Americana land, it's all just music, man. If you like one of them, great - go buy it.": "Chris",
  "So now I have a collection of poetry by Aaron Neville and I give it to people I want to share it with. I'd like to publish it someday.": "Aaron",
  "I write poetry on my iPhone. I've got about 100 poems on there.": "Aaron",
  "It's more fun to have a name rather than a number. I think this gives our products a personality. I get the names from literature, movies, opera, traveling, nature, poetry, sometimes even the street. I keep a small book that I write in. I wake up in the middle of the night and jot down a name for a lipstick or an eyeshadow.": "Francois",
  "Magna Carta has become totemic. It is in the comedy of Tony Hancock, in the poetry of Kipling, never far from the front pages in a constitutional crisis.": "Melvyn",
  "I think poetry is a fabulous medium to encapsulate thoughts far more precisely than prose.": "Kapil",
  "I was writing poetry, and the Mountain Goats was an outgrowth of that.": "John",
  "Opera combines pretty basic theater and poetry, but the storyline itself is actually quite poetic and, after some digital research, taking that actual content and seeing it as undeniably poetic.": "John",
  "My father would tell me if I wasn't writing in meter verse, it wasn't poetry.": "John",
  "I do think digital media encourages speed-reading, which can be fine if one is simply seeking information. But a serious novel or work of history or volume of poetry is an experience one should savor, take time over.": "Michael",
  "Most lyric poetry is about love, whether yearned after, fulfilled, or wistfully regretted; what isn't tends to consist of laments and cris du coeur over this, that, and the other.": "Michael",
  "It's something we, guys, have all done. Made tapes for girls, trying to impress them, to meet them on a shared plane of aesthetics. Read them someone else's poetry because they do poetry better than you could do it, because you're too awkward to do it.": "John",
  "Muhammadan law in its relation to women, is a pattern to European law. Look back to the history of Islam, and you will find that women have often taken leading places - on the throne, in the battle-field, in politics, in literature, poetry, etc.": "Annie",
  "I never really liked poetry readings; I liked to read poetry by myself, but I liked singing, chanting my lyrics to this jazz group.": "Leonard",
  "I always thought that poetry is the verdict that others give to a certain kind of writing. So to call yourself a poet is a kind of dangerous description. It's for others it's for others to use. ": "Leonard",
  "I have written about some truly great writers - John Steinbeck, Robert Frost, and William Faulkner. Faulkner and Frost were the very peaks of American poetry and fiction in the 20th century.": "Jay",
  "I think of it this way: When you hear that people have downloaded your comic, appreciate that thousands are eager to hear what you have to say. The poetry club down the hall may not have the same problem. That's a good problem to have.": "Mark",
  "Poetry stands or falls by its music.": "John",
  "My poems tend to be more celebratory and lyrical, and the novels so far pretty dark. Poetry doesn't seem to me to be an appropriate tool for exploring that.": "John",
  "With fiction, I tend to get to my desk and start writing. Poetry I write in my head, often while walking, so that my poems have an organic quality, hopefully.": "John",
  "I realised I'd spent a lot of time in my poetry trying to find a way of talking about that whereof we cannot speak.": "John",
  "I was a 16-year-old girl at one point, so of course I wrote poetry.": "Elizabeth",
  "I was born in a world of opera, theatre, films, poetry, art, and therefore, out of the wire, I made a stage. That's why they call me a high wire artist.": "Philippe",
  "I was always interested in French poetry sort of as a sideline to my own work, I was translating contemporary French poets. That kind of spilled out into translation as a way to earn money, pay for food and put bread on the table.": "Paul",
  "I started out in life as a poet; I was only writing poetry all through my 20s. It wasn't until I was about 30 that I got serious about writing prose. While I was writing poems, I would often divert myself by reading detective novels; I liked them.": "Paul",
  "Every American poet feels that the whole responsibility for contemporary poetry has fallen upon his shoulders, that he is a literary aristocracy of one.": "W.",
  "I think when kids just see well-crafted poetry, it's just obtuse to them. It's hard to relate to.": "Jewel",
  "I've always had a love for poetry and when I got signed to a record label I thought, 'How odd that I'm doing a record before a book of poetry,'": "Jewel",
  "Poetry. I read Walt Whitman, Emily Dickinson, and Jane Hirschfield. I like to read Billy Collins out loud.": "Amy",
  "When you act, you've got to be like a poet or a musician. It's not about evidence before court. It's not a forensic subject. It's poetry; it's a completely different place.": "Rhys",
  "You know, bad poetry I wrote in high school can still be found on the Internet, and, you know, there's a Web log of our college newspaper. You know, there's so many different stages of my creative development are sort of on-record if somebody were to choose to look for them.": "Lena",
  "I have written some songs, but I would really call what I've done poetry at the end of the day, because I'll sit with my guitar for hours and hours on end for, like, a week and then I won't touch it for a month. I also just have no confidence. And you know what? I don't have time, because I'd rather be doing other things, like knitting.": "Amanda",
  "I'm moving to Rio permanently with my family. It's one of the places left in the world where people still live with a big charge of poetry on a daily basis. I feel we've kind of lost that here in Europe.": "Vincent",
  "Every single soul is a poem.": "Michael",
  "A poem is true if it hangs together. Information points to something else. A poem points to nothing but itself.": "E.",
  "The sort of poetry I seek resides in objects man can't touch.": "E.",
  "A definition of poetry can only determine what poetry should be and not what poetry actually was and is otherwise the most concise formula would be: Poetry is that which at some time and some place was thus named. ": "Karl",
  "One has only as much morality as one has philosophy and poetry.": "Karl",
  "Women are treated as unjustly in poetry as in life. The feminine ones are not idealistic, and the idealistic not feminine.": "Karl",
  "From what the moderns want, we must learn what poetry should become; from what the ancients did, what poetry must be.": "Karl",
  "Women do not have as great a need for poetry because their own essence is poetry.": "Karl",
  "Nothing truly convincing - which would possess thoroughness, vigor, and skill - has been written against the ancients as yet; especially not against their poetry.": "Karl",
  "If you want to see mankind fully, look at a family. Within the family minds become organically one, and for this reason the family is total poetry.": "Karl",
  "A connection between poetry and blindness is a classical trope.": "Justin",
  "I used to spend a lot of time dreaming and writing poetry.": "Mohit",
  "I think if a poet wanted to lead, he or she would want the message to be unequivocally clear and free of ambiguity. Whereas poetry is actually the home of ambiguity, ambivalence and uncertainty.": "Billy",
  "In the long revolt against inherited forms that has by now become the narrative of 20th-century poetry in English, no poet was more flamboyant or more recognizable in his iconoclasm than Cummings.": "Billy",
  "There are interesting forms of difficulty, and there are unprofitable forms of difficulty. I mean, I enjoy some difficult poetry, but some of it is impenetrable and I actually wouldn't want to penetrate it if I could, perhaps.": "Billy",
  "Listeners are kind of ambushed... if a poem just happens to be said when they're listening to the radio. The listener doesn't have time to deploy what I call their 'poetry deflector shields' that were installed in high school - there's little time to resist the poem.": "Billy",
  "I'm pretty much all for poetry in public places - poetry on buses, poetry on subways, on billboards, on cereal boxes.": "Billy",
  "We love, you know, children love the ingredients of poetry. And then they go into this tunnel that we call adolescence, and when they come out of it, they hate poetry.": "Billy",
  "I have my Poetry 180 project, which I've made my main project. We encourage high schools, because that's really where, for most people, poetry dies off and gets buried under other adolescent pursuits.": "Billy",
  "I don't think anybody reads a book of poetry front to back. Editors and reviewers only. I don't think anybody else does.": "Billy",
  "When I was a young man, I understood that poetry was two things - it was difficult to understand, but you could understand that the poet was miserable. So for a while there, I wrote poems that were hard to understand, even by me, but gave off whiffs of misery.": "Billy",
  "When I became poet laureate, I was in a slightly uncomfortable position because I think a lot of poetry isn't worth reading.": "Billy",
  "For most Americans, poetry plays no role in their everyday lives. But also for most Americans, contemporary painting or jazz or sculpture play no role either. I'm not saying poetry is singled out as a special thing to ignore.": "Billy",
  "People think of poetry as a school subject... Poetry is very frustrating to students because they don't have a taste for ambiguity, for one thing. That gives them a poetry hangover.": "Billy",
  "My persona is less miserable than a lot of contemporary poetry speakers are.": "Billy",
  "I'm all for poetry catching up with technology, and just as there are iTunes, I think we should have iPoems. I mean, people should be able to walk around with their earbuds in and listening to poems on their iPod.": "Billy",
  "I find a lot of poetry very disappointing, but I do have poets that I go back to. One book of poetry that I'd like to mention is 'The Exchange' by Sophie Cabot Black. Her poems are difficult without being too difficult.": "Billy",
  "Some honor Cummings as the granddaddy of all American innovators in poetry and ascribe to him a diverse progeny that includes virtually any poet who considers the page a field and allows silence to be part of poetry's expressiveness.": "Billy",
  "Few rappers realize the genre sprang from West African griots through Delta slave songs to jazz poetry and the comedic trash talk of 'the dozens.'": "Quincy",
  "I always wrote poetry as a teenager and it was always so dark, but it made me feel good to get it out.": "Pink",
  "I like poetry when I don't quite understand why I like it. Poetry isn't just a question of wrapping something up and giving it to someone else to unwrap. It just doesn't work like that.": "Mark",
  "I like to write poetry.": "Rebecca",
  "I wrote things for the school's newspaper, and - like all teenagers - I dabbled in poetry.": "Stephen",
  "You know that thing people say, 'poetry is the hardest, stories are the second hardest, novels are the easiest?' I'm here to tell you that novels are the hardest. Writing a novel is unbelievably difficult. It's nightmarish.": "Ethan",
  "I love the simple poetry of theater, where you can stand in a spotlight on a stage and wrap a coat around you, and say, 'It was 1860 and it was winter...'": "Gary",
  "You don't have to live in a garage to write great poetry.": "Felix",
  "I want to prove that if you write in strict meter and rhyme about subjects people care about, they will buy poetry.": "Felix",
  "I am absolutely convinced that my life was redeemed by poetry.": "Felix",
  "With a poetry book I can send 100 copies out to reviewers and other people, and even do it in advance and get their response. It's difficult with iPad: how do you send it out for free, and how do you even disseminate it before it goes into their store?": "Felix",
  "Poetry is one of the oldest of all art forms, and one of its powers for shamans and tribal leaders was the mnemonic.": "Felix",
  "Poetry is the experience of liberty. The poet risks himself, chances all on the poem's all with each verse he writes.": "Octavio",
  "Poetry is not a genre in harmony with the modern world; its innermost nature is hostile or indifferent to the dogmas of modern times, progress and the cult of the future.": "Octavio",
  "Poetry, whatever the manifest content of the poem, is always a violation of the rationalism and morality of bourgeois society.": "Octavio",
  "Any reflection about poetry should begin, or end, with this question: who and how many read poetry books?": "Octavio",
  "I've written for every medium except poetry, at which I suck.": "J.",
  "Poetry is not an issue of form and enjambments. Poetry, as the word is classically used, has to do with sound and sense. It can be rhyme. It can be rhythm, pace, breath.": "Tim",
  "Sufi poetry is, in a sense, self-help poetry about how to live a decent life, how to deal with your mortality.": "Mohsin",
  "Sylvia Plath, Rumi, there's a lot of spoken word poets who do a really incredible job putting their spoken work into page poetry - that's what I strive to do.": "Mary",
  "There is no real way to categorize McLean's 'American Pie' for its hybrid of modern poetry and folk ballad, beer-hall chant and high-art rock.": "Douglas",
  "That's all there was in our house: poetry and choir rehearsal and duets and so forth I listened to Dad and Mother discuss things about poetry and delivery and voice and diction - I don't think anyone could know how much it really means. ": "Chuck",
  "My dad was the cause of me being in show business. He was not only in poetry but in acting a bit. He was Mordecai in the play 'A Dream of Queen Esther.'": "Chuck",
  "I love poetry. I love rhyming. Do you know, there are poets who don't rhyme? Shakespeare did not rhyme most of the time, and that's why I do not like him.": "Chuck",
  "All I knew about Ethiopia was from a few records that I like, as well as what I read about the famine. But you get there and it's another world. It's filled with art and music and poetry and intellectuals and writers - all kinds of people.": "Flea",
  "My dad is a Jack Nicholson lookalike and a frustrated performer, my mother's into reading and poetry. I suppose the thing I owe them most is my confidence.": "Michael",
  "For thousands of years, poetry has been picturing love as a mysterious and tragic power. But when anyone says the same thing in plain prose, and adds that life would be colourless and poor without the great passions, then this is called immorality!": "Ellen",
  "When the modern movement began, starting perhaps with the paintings of Manet and the poetry of Baudelaire and Rimbaud, what distinguished the modern movement was the enormous honesty that writers, painters and playwrights displayed about themselves. The bourgeois novel flinches from such notions.": "J.",
  "Poetry is what we turn to in the most emotional moments of our life - when a beloved friend dies, when a baby is born or when we fall in love.": "Erica",
  "Poetry is the language we speak in the most terrifying or ecstatic passages of our lives. But the very word poetry scares people. They think of their grade school teachers reciting 'Hiawatha' and they groan.": "Erica",
  "I guess the thing that I'm most proud of is that I kept on writing poetry. I understand that poetry is sort of the source of everything I do. It's the source of my creativity.": "Erica",
  "I thought to spend my declining years writing poetry and teaching - but that won't pay the Bergdorf's bill. I think I'll move to somewhere life is cheaper.": "Erica",
  "Often I find that poems predict what I'm going to do later in my own writing, and often I find that poems predict my life. So I think poetry is the most intense expression of feeling that we have.": "Erica",
  "In poetry you can express almost inexpressible feelings. You can express the pain of loss, you can express love. People always turn to poetry when someone they love dies, when they fall in love.": "Erica",
  "I can't understand Urdu, Bahasa or Russian, but when the Pakistani Faiz, the Indonesian Rendra and the Russian Rosdentvensky declaim, I can feel the living throb of rhythm and music, the warmth and passion of their poetry, as do the hundreds, not a mere roomful, of poetry lovers in the audience.": "F.",
  "We read Robert Browning's poetry. Here we needed no guidance from the professor: the poems themselves were enough.": "Carl",
  "When I was writing pretty poor poetry, this girl with midnight black hair told me to go on.": "Carl",
  "Poetry is a phantom script telling how rainbows are made and why they go away.": "Carl",
  "My work should be seen as poetry.": "Robert",
  "The commitment to working at poetry is important because a poet is a maker, and a poem is a made thing. We have to honor our feelings by working to transform them into something meaningful and lasting.": "Edward",
  "I'm a poet, and I spent my life in poetry.": "Edward",
  "Someone who's awake in the middle of the night is a soul consciousness when everyone else is asleep, and that creates a feeling of solitude in poetry that I very much like.": "Edward",
  "You're shadowed by your own dream, especially as you get older, of trying to create something that will last in poetry. And so, you're working on its behalf.": "Edward",
  "There have always been great defenses of poetry, and I've tried to write mine, and I think all of my work and criticism is a defense of poetry to try and keep something alive in poetry.": "Edward",
  "When I taught at the University of Houston in the Creative Writing program, we required the poets to take workshops in fiction writing, and we required the fiction writers to take workshops in poetry.": "Edward",
  "I don't think you can read poetry while you're watching television very well.": "Edward",
  "The idea of how to read a poem is based on the idea that poetry needs you as a reader. That the experience of poetry, the meaning in poetry, is a kind of circuit that takes place between a poet, a poem and a reader, and that meaning doesn't exist or inhere in poems alone.": "Edward",
  "There's never been a culture without poetry in the history of the world.": "Edward",
  "In every culture, in every language, there is expressive play, expressive word play; there's language use to different purposes that we would call poetry.": "Edward",
  "I don't think poetry will die, but I think that poetry does demand a certain kind of attention to language. It does demand a certain space in order to read it, and I think that space is somewhat threatened by the lack of attention that people have and the amount of time that they give to things.": "Edward",
  "I had feelings that I didn't know what to do with, and I felt better when I started writing them. I thought of it as poetry. I did notice girls really liked it. Better than football. They liked the combination.": "Edward",
  "I'd say people do need some help with poetry because I think poetry just helps takes us to places that Americans aren't always accustomed to going.": "Edward",
  "I find great consolation in having a lot of poetry books around. I believe that writing poetry and reading it are deeply intertwined. I've always delighted in the company of the poets I've read.": "Edward",
  "As long as there's been poetry, there have been lamentations.": "Edward",
  "Poetry is a form of necessary speech... I have sought to restore the aura of sacred practice that accompanies true poetic creation, to honor both the rational and the irrational elements of poetry.": "Edward",
  "Poetry is meant to inspire readers and listeners, to connect them more deeply to themselves even as it links them more fully to others. But many people feel put off by the terms of poetry, its odd vocabulary, its notorious difficulty.": "Edward",
  "The terms of poetry - some simple, some complicated, some ancient, some new - should bring us closer to what we're hearing, enlarging our experience of it, enabling us to describe what we're reading, to feel and think with greater precision.": "Edward",
  "The line is a way of framing poetry. All verse is measured by lines. The poetic line immediately announces its difference from everyday speech and prose.": "Edward",
  "The sense of flowing, which is so crucial to song, is also crucial to poetry.": "Edward",
  "When poetry separates from song, then the words have to carry all the rhythm themselves; they have to do all the work. They can't rely on the singing voice.": "Edward",
  "One of the things that distinguishes poetry from ordinary speech is that in a very few number of words, poetry captures some kind of deep feeling, and rhythm is the way to get there. Rhythm is the way the poetry carries itself.": "Edward",
  "I started writing poetry as a teenager in suburban Chicago out of emotional desperation.": "Edward",
  "I grew up in a middle-class house without books, without art. No one around me wrote poetry or even read it.": "Edward",
  "Poetry itself hasn't been well served by poets who fled to the margins.": "Edward",
  "I aspire to a poetry of great formal integrity, deep passion and high intellect, and I have many models for how to do that.": "Edward",
  "I'm so happy to be an advocate for poetry.": "Edward",
  "I didn't read poetry seriously until college, when I really began to devour it in a very intense way. I also discovered that a poet is a maker. Before that, I thought a poet was someone who wrote about his own experiences.": "Edward",
  "The idea that a poem was a made thing stayed with me, and I decided then that I wanted to be an artist, not just a diarist. So I put myself through a kind of apprenticeship in writing poetry, and I understood even then that my practice as a poet was deeply related to my reading.": "Edward",
  "Poetry is a vocation. It is not a career but a calling.": "Edward",
  "Writing poetry is such an intense experience that it helps to start the process in a casual or wayward frame of mind.": "Edward",
  "Poetry takes place in time. It is a durational. Things take place in sequence.": "Edward",
  "Poetry, being supremely useless, by its very existence represents a protest against the so-called 'real world' of busy-ness and moneymaking, so we must embrace, salute and support our poets.": "Tom",
  "I didn't start off as a journalist; I started off as a poet. My ambition was to practise poetry. Then I found journalism, but that other voice never fled from me.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "One thing I do know is that poetry, to be understood, must be clear.": "Mary",
  "People want poetry. They need poetry. They get it. They don't want fancy work.": "Mary",
  "Poetry is meant to be heard.": "Mary",
  "You know, in my music career there was a moment where the irony was just so heavy. There were people in my audience that were the reason I developed neuroses. These people that tortured my life were using my art, my poetry, as fuel for them, to torture other people.": "Fred",
  "I really enjoy English and poetry and writing classes.": "Taylor",
  "All one's inventions are true, you can be sure of that. Poetry is as exact a science as geometry.": "Gustave",
  "Poetry is something to make us wiser and better, by continually revealing those types of beauty and truth, which God has set in all men's souls.": "James",
  "As the years pass, I find that writers who were once central to me aren't anymore. I revered Yeats's poetry in college. I respect it now and am still ravished by certain lines, but I don't go back to him again and again. I do go back to Emily Dickinson again and again.": "Margo",
  "Popular music is one endless love song that, I suspect, the basically solitary Ella Fitzgerald approached much as the basically solitary Marianne Moore approached poetry: reading it with a certain contempt for it, Moore said, you could find a place in it for the genuine.": "Margo",
  "Fiction is supposed to be immersive and supposed to be entertaining and narrative, so structures have to be buried a little bit. If they come foregrounded too much, it stops being fiction and starts being poetry - something more concrete and out of time.": "Eleanor",
  "Poetry was one of the things that interested me most as I was growing up. I used to write it in my head all the time. I still think the very greatest pleasure in life is to write a poem.": "Claire",
  "'Words and Music' on Radio 3 is always a treat. Actors read passages of poetry and prose interspersed with music, and nobody tells you what it is. Later you can look it up online, but at the time you can't cheat.": "Claire",
  "I read usually in the morning, in my kitchen at breakfast - a short reading time, usually poetry. I read in bed every night. I usually get in bed pretty early with a book, and I read until I can't prop my eyes open anymore - sometimes rather late.": "Sue",
  "Country music especially can get very formulaic - you know, you have to have your verses and a bridge and a chorus, and a lot of the songs are written as just plain and simple poetry on the road.": "Sturgill",
  "Poetry is the hardest thing that there is. It fascinates me, so I want to write more of it.": "Steve",
  "Gregory Corso used to get really pissed when people called Bob Dylan a 'poet.' After writing poetry for a few years, I can understand that.": "Steve",
  "Becoming interested in poetics got me interested in theater. Theater is supposed to be poetry, you know, before it's anything else. It just doesn't fly if it isn't musical.": "Steve",
  "I wrote poetry, which got me into lyrics. Stevie Wonder, Carole King, Elton John pulled me into pop. I started singing with a band - just for fun - when I was 17. And pretty soon, I was thinking I could sing pop in English as well as Spanish.": "Gloria",
  "Is there any purpose to translating poetry? A poem does not contain information of importance, like a signpost or a warning notice.": "James",
  "I used to buy scented poetry books on tour and read aloud to the band. Not what you'd expect, huh?": "Suzi",
  "There was no market for poetry about trauma, abuse, loss, love, and healing through the lens of a Punjabi-Sikh immigrant woman.": "Rupi",
  "I would give anything to sing like Beyonce or Adele. I've said many times to my friends that if I could sing like them, I would give up poetry and writing.": "Rupi",
  "Poetry and art are key influences in changing how we look at taboos.": "Rupi",
  "'Milk and Honey' was written with me being honest to myself, kind of pulling at the things that I hear the most and saying that out loud, and you know, that thing that we hear the most is most universal, and so that rings true with all folks. The language used in the poetry is extremely, extremely accessible.": "Rupi",
  "For me, the power of the poetry in 'Milk and Honey' is the feeling you get after finished reading the poem. It's the emotion you feel once you've read the last word, and that is only possible when the diction is easy, and you don't get stuck on every other word, you don't know what the word means.": "Rupi",
  "'Hamilton' is, of course, closely tied to the Obamas because Lin first performed the opening number at a White House poetry jam.": "Phillipa",
  "I was one of those dark, quiet kids that wrote poetry.": "Rick",
  "When superstition is allowed to perform the task of old age in dulling the human temperament, we can say goodbye to all excellence in poetry, in painting, and in music.": "Denis",
  "When I arrived at Columbia, I gave up acting and became interested in all things French. French poetry, French history, French literature.": "Joseph",
  "Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.": "Ed",
  "You can be intuitive when you've got a more expansive role. You can get into the poetry of telling the story rather than just pushing buttons.": "Willem",
  "As I grew older - collapsing into my seventies, glimpsing ahead the cliffs of the eighties, colliding into eighty-five - poetry abandoned me.": "Donald",
  "Prose is not so dependent on sound. The line of poetry, with the breaking of the line - to me, sound is the kind of doorway into poetry. And my sense of sound, or my ability to control it, lapsed or grew less.": "Donald",
  "After a couple of years of public high school, I went to Exeter - an insane conglomeration of adolescent males in the wilderness, all of whom claimed to hate poetry.": "Donald",
  "I loathe the trivialization of poetry that happens in creative writing classes. Teachers set exercises to stimulate subject matter: Write a poem about an imaginary landscape with real people in it. Write about a place your parents lived in before you were born. We have enough terrible poetry around without encouraging more of it.": "Donald",
  "I've always felt that poetry was particularly erotic, more than prose was... I say that you read poems not with your eyes and not with your ears, but with your mouth. You taste it.": "Donald",
  "For better or worse, poetry is my life.": "Donald",
  "Sound had always been my portal to poetry, but in the beginning, sound was imagined through the eye.": "Donald",
  "Poetry is what I've done my whole life. And every important thing in my life had found itself into poems.": "Donald",
  "In my life, I've seen enormous increase in the consumption of poetry. When I was young, there were virtually no poetry readings.": "Donald",
  "Poetry offers works of art that are beautiful, like paintings, which are my second favorite work of the art, but there are also works of art that embody emotion and that are kind of school for feeling. They teach how to feel, and they do this by the means of their beauty of language.": "Donald",
  "I was at Harvard with a whole bunch of poets, and that was very rare. They published a lot of books because there was an excitement after the war that translated into poetry.": "Donald",
  "When it comes to poetry, I think partly the numbers of people attempting to write poems is probably a result or the reaction to technology.": "Donald",
  "Every afternoon, I shut the door of my bedroom to write: Poetry was secret, dangerous, wicked and delicious.": "Donald",
  "A song is a short composition for voice and instruments. It is a piece of sung poetry set to music. It is usually only a few minutes long.": "Russell",
  "Poetry has been to me its own exceeding great reward it has given me the habit of wishing to discover the good and beautiful in all that meets and surrounds me. ": "Samuel",
  "I always loved singing and writing poetry. I always loved music, and I've loved writing my whole life. When I put them together, it was probably in my early 20s where I put words to music for the first time.": "Lisa",
  "When poetry is on the money, 12 words can slay you. I admire that greatly.": "Daniel",
  "I'm very attracted to poetry for all the reasons someone likes poetry. The notion of compression seems to fit my personality.": "Daniel",
  "I read a little bit of nonfiction and a lot of poetry. I think of poetry as my shot of whiskey when I don't have time to savor a whole bottle of wine.": "Alice",
  "The language of the Catholic Church - the liturgy, the prayer, the gospels - was in many ways my first poetry.": "Alice",
  "I believed in fictional characters as if they were a part of real life. Poetry was important, too. My parents had memorized poems from their days attending school in New York City and loved reciting them. We all enjoyed listening to these poems and to music as well.": "Alice",
  "Making love is, simply put, poetry in motion.": "Wale",
  "I always read poetry before I write, to sensitize me to the rhythms and music of language.": "Janet",
  "History gives you insight of the same quality of truth as poetry or philosophy or a novel.": "Simon",
  "Somehow, the words don't have any vitality, any life to them, unless I can feel it marking on a paper. That's how I start. Once I'm off, then I switch to the laptop. I think it would all just be prose if it started on a laptop - not that what I do is poetry.": "Simon",
  "As a schoolboy, poetry seemed defined by preciousness. It was all very rarefied.": "Simon",
  "The difficulty with poetry is that it doesn't have the life that Shakespeare or Jane Austen have beyond the page. You can't make a costume drama out of it. There's no place for it to go except trapped inside its little book.": "Simon",
  "The library was open for one hour after school let out. I hid there, looking at art books and reading poetry.": "Lynda",
  "Dancing is the poetry of the foot.": "John",
  "Poetry is so vital to us until school spoils it.": "Russell",
  "Anticipating that most poetry will be worse than carrying heavy luggage through O'Hare Airport, the public, to its loss, reads very little of it.": "Russell",
  "I think the novel is not so much a literary genre, but a literary space, like a sea that is filled by many rivers. The novel receives streams of science, philosophy, poetry and contains all of these; it's not simply telling a story.": "Jose",
  "Nothing is too small. Nothing is too, quote-unquote, ordinary or insignificant. Those are the things that make up the measure of our days, and they're the things that sustain us. And they're the things that certainly can become worthy of poetry.": "Rita",
  "I try to show what it is about language and music that enthralls, because I think those are the two elements of poetry.": "Rita",
  "There are distinct duties of a poet laureate. I plan a reading series at the Library of Congress and advise the librarian. The rest is how I want to promote poetry.": "Rita",
  "I was apprehensive. I feared every time I talked about poetry, it would be filtered through the lens of race, sex, and age.": "Rita",
  "I see a resurgence of interest in poetry. I am less optimistic about the prospects for the arts when it comes to federal funding.": "Rita",
  "The poetry that sustains me is when I feel that, for a minute, the clouds have parted and I've seen ecstasy or something.": "Rita",
  "I think one of the things that people tend to forget is that poets do write out of life. It isn't some set piece that then gets put up on the shelf, but that the impetus, the real instigation for poetry is everything that's happening around us.": "Rita",
  "Not too many people know it, but when I was in junior high, I was a pretty tough kid and was the leader of a street gang. Well, OK, it was less a street gang than an Ecology Club. We were pretty intimidating, though, and had our own meeting room until we got run out of there by a bunch of thugs from the Poetry Society.": "W.",
  "I want to be the best advocate and promoter for poetry that I can be.": "Natasha",
  "From the catbird seat, I've found poetry to be the necessary utterance it has always been in America.": "Natasha",
  "Dismissals of poetry are nothing new. It's easy to dismiss poetry if one has not read much of it.": "Natasha",
  "The first thing I tried to do in the months after losing my mother was to write a poem. I found myself turning to poetry in the way so many people do - to make sense of losses. And I wrote pretty bad poems about it. But it did feel that the poem was the only place that could hold this grief.": "Natasha",
  "I think I felt at some point that I couldn't understand poetry or that it was beyond me or it didn't speak to my experience. I think that was because I hadn't yet found the right poems to invite me in.": "Natasha",
  "My father, Eric Trethewey, is a poet, so I had one right inside the house. And on long trips, he'd tell me, if I got bored in the car, to write a poem about it. And I did find that poetry was a way for me, I think as it for a lot of people, to articulate those things that seem hardest to say.": "Natasha",
  "I think poetry's always a kind of faith. It is the kind that I have.": "Natasha",
  "Even though I am the daughter of a poet, and my stepmother is also a poet, growing up, I didn't think I could understand poetry; I didn't think that it had any relevance to my life, the feelings that I endured on a day-to-day basis, until I was introduced to the right poem.": "Natasha",
  "I think people turn to poetry more often than they think they do, or encounter it in more ways than they think that they do. I think we forget the places that we encounter it, say, in songs or in other little bits and pieces of things that we may have remembered from childhood.": "Natasha",
  "I think the biggest thing that I have to do is to remind people that poetry is there for us to turn to not only to remind us that we're not alone - for example, if we are grieving the loss of someone - but also to help us celebrate our joys. That's why so many people I know who've gotten married will have a poem read at the wedding.": "Natasha",
  "Poetry's a thing that belongs to everyone.": "Natasha",
  "'NewsHour' is very interested in poetry, but they're also interested in not just that something's cute to add on at the end of their programming, but something that actually is integrated into the news.": "Natasha",
  "I've been most happy to be an advocate for the kinds of grassroots things that people are doing who care about poetry.": "Natasha",
  "I like the beauty of Faulkner's poetry. But I don't like his themes, not at all.": "Manuel",
  "I spent many years of my life as an economist and demographer. I was finally distracted by writing my novels and poetry. I'm enormously happy that was the case. I feel that with writing I have found my metier.": "Vikram",
  "You have to learn a few things, which you do along the way, but basically, poetry is a matter of the ear. Iambic pentameters or what constitutes a stanza comes naturally - your ears will know.": "Vikram",
  "Why do writers, say, give up a job in economics and decide to write poetry? Or, why do they give up a job in a bank and decide to paint, like Krishan Khanna? They want to convey something.": "Vikram",
  "Everyone sort of sees his own life and times as being ephemeral. One thinks that everything good or important that happened, happened in the past. But I think that seeing scenes that you are used to, but with the heightening effects of poetry, perhaps makes you value your life and times more than you might otherwise do.": "Vikram",
  "Those books of mine that are remunerative - I'm not talking about poetry here - take years to write, and I am never sure they'll be successful. So writing is a risk in more senses than one.": "Vikram",
  "You know, I can imagine not writing a novel and writing poetry only.": "Vikram",
  "The Lord's Prayer is the most perfect piece of poetry. I always feel at peace and moved when I recite it.": "Mary",
  "The poet doesn't invent. He listens.": "Jean",
  "A true poet does not bother to be poetical. Nor does a nursery gardener scent his roses.": "Jean",
  "Poetry is indispensable - if I only knew what for.": "Jean",
  "The sentences I write have their roots in song and poetry, and take their bearings from music and painting, as much as from the need to impart mere information, or mirror anything. I am not a realist writer, even if I seem like one.": "Colm",
  "Thinking in its lower grades, is comparable to paper money, and in its higher forms it is a kind of poetry.": "Havelock",
  "When I was in college, I used to write little ditties and short stories and poetry for my friends. Writing a book is another thing. It is so much different from my traditional day of dirty fingernails and greasy hair and hot pans.": "Mario",
  "I actually remember celebrating National Poetry Day at school I remember having to write and read a load. ": "Tinie",
  "Most poetry in the modern age has retreated to the private sphere, turning its back on the political realm.": "Terry",
  "Poetry is the most subtle of the literary arts, and students grow more ingenious by the year at avoiding it. If they can nip around Milton, duck under Blake and collapse gratefully into the arms of Jane Austen, a lot of them will.": "Terry",
  "When I started writing poetry, it was always in very hip-hop influenced spaces: Someone would teach a Nas song side-by-side with a Gwendolyn Brooks poem, and we'd talk about the connections between those things.": "Jamila",
  "I have a band called M&O. We were working on our first album in 2011 or 2012. We were looking for people to collaborate with, and I met Chance through a Young Chicago Authors poetry slam.": "Jamila",
  "It was through poetry I learned just to appreciate my own voice and to not think of my voice in terms of what it needs to be able to do, but what it can do.": "Jamila",
  "My artistic manifesto exists in the world as poetry. So even though most of the things that I've done have been on other people's projects or could be pigeonholed in certain ways, that's not how I perceive myself.": "Jamila",
  "I really liked 'Blk Girl Art.' It's like a manifesto saying why I create, whether it's poetry or music.": "Jamila",
  "If a poem is not memorable, there's probably something wrong. One of the problems of free verse is that much of the free verse poetry is not memorable.": "Robert",
  "I think that it's more likely that in my 60s and 70s I will be writing poetry rather than fiction.": "Robert",
  "I did not have a very literary background. I came to poetry from the sciences and mathematics, and also through an interest in Japanese and Chinese poetry in translation.": "Robert",
  "You have to really dive deep back into yourself and get rid of so much modern analytical categorization. It's one of the great things poetry does.": "Robert",
  "The great watershed of modern poetry is French, more than English.": "Robert",
  "Among the American contemporaries I read with most enjoyment are several North Carolinians. I think the best poetry being written these days is being written by Southerners.": "Robert",
  "The Language Poets are writing only about language itself. The Ashbery poets are writing only about poetry itself. That seems to me a kind of dead end.": "Robert",
  "Poetry, almost by definition, calls attention to its language and form.": "Robert",
  "The decision to write in prose instead of poetry is made more by the readers than by writers. Almost no one is interested in reading narrative in verse.": "Robert",
  "Teaching writing over the years intrudes on your own writing in important ways, taking away some of the excitement of poetry.": "Robert",
  "I don't think poetry is something that can be taught. We can encourage young writers, but what you can't teach them is the very essence of poetry.": "Robert",
  "I don't think the creative writing industry has helped American poetry.": "Robert",
  "Some people swear by writing courses, but whether it really helps American poetry, I have doubts.": "Robert",
  "I don't think American poetry has gotten any better in the past 35 years. Oddly enough, creative writing programs seem to have been good for fiction, and I would not have predicted that.": "Robert",
  "I love to compare different time frames. Poetry can evoke the time of the subject. By a very careful choice of words you can evoke an era, completely throw the poem into a different time scale.": "Robert",
  "One of the most powerful devices of poetry is the use of distortions. You can go from talking about the way a minute passes to the way a century passes, or a lifetime.": "Robert",
  "A poem in form still has to have voice, gesture, a sense of discovery, a metaphoric connection, as any poetry does.": "Robert",
  "The fact that something is in a rhymed form or in blank verse will not make it good poetry.": "Robert",
  "What actually makes poetry poetry is of course impossible to define. We recognize it when we hear it, when we see it, but we can't define it.": "Robert",
  "The idea of avant-garde art is a very suspicious thing to me, the idea that poetry is new and it keeps being new the way Chevrolets every year are new.": "Robert",
  "Part of what we love about poetry is the fact that it seems ancient, that it has an authority of ancient language and ancient form, and that it's timeless, that it reaches back.": "Robert",
  "I learned to impersonate the kind of person that talks about poetry. It comes from teaching, I think.": "Robert",
  "And, I mean, I think poetry does need to be met to some extent, especially, I guess, 19th century poetry, and for me, it's just been so worth the effort. It's like I'm planting a garden in my head.": "Jane",
  "As for how criticism of Keats' poetry relates to criticism of my own work, I'll leave that for others to decide.": "Jane",
  "I have to admit that I had a lot of problems with poetry.": "Jane",
  "Poetry, especially traditional Iranian poetry, is very good at looking at things from a number of different angles simultaneously.": "Asghar",
  "My feeling is that poetry will wither on the vine if you don't regularly come back to the simplest fundamentals of the poem: rhythm, rhyme, simple subjects - love, death, war.": "James",
  "Lyric poetry is, of course, musical in origin. I do know that what happened to poetry in the twentieth century was that it began to be written for the page. When it's a question of typography, why not? Poets have done beautiful things with typography - Apollinaire's 'Calligrammes,' that sort of thing.": "James",
  "English poetry begins whenever we decide to say the modern English language begins, and it extends as far as we decide to say that the English language extends.": "James",
  "Some people think that English poetry begins with the Anglo-Saxons. I don't, because I can't accept that there is any continuity between the traditions of Anglo-Saxon poetry and those established in English poetry by the time of, say, Shakespeare. And anyway, Anglo-Saxon is a different language, which has to be learned.": "James",
  "When we study Shakespeare on the page, for academic purposes, we may require all kinds of help. Generally, we read him in modern spelling and with modern punctuation, and with notes. But any poetry that is performed - from song lyric to tragic speech - must make its point, as it were, without reference back.": "James",
  "Composers need words, but they do not necessarily need poetry. The Russian composer, Aleksandr Mossolov, who chose texts from newspaper small ads, had a good point to make. With revolutionary music, any text can be set to work.": "James",
  "A glance at the history of European poetry is enough to inform us that rhyme itself is not indispensable. Latin poetry in the classical age had no use for it, and the kind of Latin poetry that does rhyme - as for instance the medieval 'Carmina Burana' - tends to be somewhat crude stuff in comparison with the classical verse that doesn't.": "James",
  "Great poetry does not have to be technically intricate.": "James",
  "The iambic pentameter owes its pre-eminence in English poetry to its genius for variation. Good blank verse does not sound like a series of identically measured lines. It sounds like a series of subtle variations on the same theme.": "James",
  "The voice is raised, and that is where poetry begins. And even today, in the prolonged aftermath of modernism, in places where 'open form' or free verse is the orthodoxy, you will find a memory of that raising of the voice in the term 'heightened speech.'": "James",
  "One problem we face comes from the lack of any agreed sense of how we should be working to train ourselves to write poetry.": "James",
  "In the writing of poetry we never know anything for sure. We will never know if we have 'trained' or 'practised' enough. We will never be able to say that we have reached grade eight, or that we have left the grades behind and are now embarked on an advanced training.": "James",
  "In the winter of 1940, 'The Atlantic Monthly' invited Peter Viereck, a twenty-three-year-old Harvard graduate who had won the college's top essay and poetry prizes, to write about 'the meaning of young liberalism for the present age.'": "Tom",
  "Poetry always, always, always is a key piece of democracy.": "Eileen",
  "As things get worse, poetry gets better because it becomes more necessary.": "Eileen",
  "I wasn't afraid of being poor. I didn't want to live in a big house. I'm the perfect size for poetry. I can move around.": "Eileen",
  "In Arlington, people would laugh at you if you tried to get people to look at your drawings or listen to your poetry. It was like you thought you were special.": "Eileen",
  "Poetry from the bottom up is an act of selection: you kind of feel your way through the crowds of poems. The good ones came forward a long time ago, and the bad ones fell away.": "Eileen",
  "Poetry and novels are lists of our devotions. We love the feel of making the marks as the feelings are rising and falling.": "Eileen",
  "Prose, poetry, and drawings stand side by side in a very democratic way in my work.": "Gunter",
  "I'd park myself in the bookstore and read with one eye on everyone coming in. I remember reading a Robert Bly book of poetry.": "Sally",
  "I lived a pretty chaotic life. I went to England, and I moved around, and there were a lot of things that I was interested in. I wrote poetry. I took photographs. I was a musician and all sorts of things. Nothing brilliant, but I did all these different things.": "Pawel",
  "Watching and learning from the great Josette Bushell-Mingo, who was playing Cleopatra in Antony and Cleopatra at the time, and then to return to the same stage six months later playing a lead role, was incredible - I fell in love with the poetry and the breadth of the language so much that I didn't want it to end.": "Gugu",
  "I never thought I'd be doing poetry books. I never really studied poetry. But the first one I did was after my mother died, and I realized that people sort of think and talk about her style and fashion, but in fact, what made her the person she was was really her love of reading and ideas.": "Caroline",
  "Poetry is really a way of sharing feelings and ideas.": "Caroline",
  "The biggest problem is people are afraid of poetry, think they can't understand it or that it will be boring.": "Caroline",
  "The mystical poetry of William Blake's artwork also forms the basis for the album cover.": "Bruce",
  "Perhaps no person can be a poet, or even enjoy poetry, without a certain unsoundness of mind.": "Thomas",
  "As civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.": "Thomas",
  "I liked Yeats! That wild Irishman. I really loved his love of language, his flow. His chaotic ideas seemed to me just the right thing for a poet. Passion! He was always on the right side. He may be wrongheaded, but his heart was always on the right side. He wrote beautiful poetry.": "Chinua",
  "I was trained as an actress. But I wasn't a very convincing actress, so I started doing punk poetry and then fell into doing stand-up.": "Jenny",
  "When I was in college, I wrote poetry very seriously, and then once I had started writing short stories, I didn't go back to poetry, partially because I felt like I understood how incredibly difficult it was.": "Elizabeth",
  "Poetry is often the art of overhearing yourself say things you didn't know you knew. It is a learned skill to force yourself to articulate your life, your present world or your possibilities for the future.": "David",
  "There's a fierce practicality and empiricism which the whole imaginative, lyrical aspect of poetry comes from.": "David",
  "Poetry is a street fighter. It has sharp elbows. It can look after itself. Poetry can't be used for manipulation it's why you never see good poetry in advertising. ": "David",
  "By definition, poetry works with qualities and dynamics that mainstream society is reluctant to face head-on. It's an interesting phenomenon that by necessity, poetry is just below the radar.": "David",
  "It is the province of poetry to be more realistic and present than the artificial narratives of an outer discourse, and not afraid of the truthful difficulty of the average human life.": "David",
  "Poetry carries the imagery which is large enough for the kind of life we want for ourselves.": "David",
  "Unfortunately, poetry is not born in noise, in crowds, or on a bus. There have to be four walls and the certainty that the telephone will not ring. That's what writing is all about.": "Wislawa",
  "Poetic talent doesn't operate in a vacuum. There is a spirit of Polish poetry.": "Wislawa",
  "Everyone needs solitude, especially a person who is used to thinking about what she experiences. Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.": "Wislawa",
  "Solitude is very important in my work as a mode of inspiration, but isolation is not good in this respect. I am not writing poetry about isolation.": "Wislawa",
  "Thomas Davis was a great man where poetry is concerned, and a better than Thomas Moore. All over Ireland his poetry is, and he would have done other things but that he died young.": "Lady",
  "I'm not a great poetry fan.": "Rupert",
  "Colloquial poetry is to the real art as the barber's wax dummy is to sculpture.": "Ezra",
  "And New York is the most beautiful city in the world? It is not far from it. No urban night is like the night there... Squares after squares of flame, set up and cut into the aether. Here is our poetry, for we have pulled down the stars to our will.": "Ezra",
  "In my late teenage years, I developed a real passion for it, and wrote a lot of poetry.": "Danielle",
  "Reading a piece of poetry with no beat in front of 20 people is way more challenging than rocking for 10,000 people.": "Macklemore",
  "I read, read enormously on all different fields of Islamic thought, from philosophy to Islamic literature, poetry, exegeses, knowledge of the Hadith, the teachings of the prophet. That's how I trained myself. And then I was appointed imam by a Sufi master from Istanbul, Turkey.": "Feisal",
  "I think going from doing TV and straight plays to Shakespeare is weird enough because you have this heightened language, and you are telling a story through metric poetry. But I think music is that place beyond poetry.": "Tamsin"
