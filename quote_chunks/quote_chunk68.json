  "There are spiritual laws at work that most people know nothing about. So when others hurt us, our tendency is to strike back because we assume that we must defend ourselves, defend our name, our honor, our career, and so on. In reality we strike back at ourselves. ... What we consider as justifiable defense of our rights may in reality plunge us into a vicious cycle that can undermine our very spiritual foundation. By reacting to aggression with aggression we lose the opportunity to spiritually benefit from the experience. this law also explains why saints, when hit, often would literally turn the other cheek.

Indeed, if we identify tyranny as the government that is not held to give account of itself, rule by Nobody is clearly the most tyrannical of all, since there is no one left who could even be asked to answer for what is being done.

  "Other personalities are created to handle new traumas, their existence usually occurring one at a time. Each has a singular purpose and is totally focused on that task. The important aspect of the mind's extreme dissociation is that each ego state is totally without knowledge of the other. Because of this, the researchers for the CIA and the Department of Defense believed they could take a personality, train him or her to be a killer and no other ego stares would be aware of the violence that was taking place. The personality running the body would be genuinely unaware of the deaths another personality was causing. Even torture could not expose the with, because the personality experiencing the torture would have no awareness of the information being sought. Earlier, such knowledge was gained from therapists working with adults who had multiple personalities. The earliest pioneers in the field, such as Dr. Ralph Alison, a psychiatrist then living in Santa Cruz, California, were helping victims of severe early childhood trauma. Because there were no protocols for treatment, the pioneers made careful notes, publishing their discoveries so other therapists would understand how to help these rare cases. By 1965, the information was fairly extensive, including the knowledge that only unusually intelligent children become multiple personalities and that sexual trauma endured by a restrained child under the age of seven is the most common way to induce hysteric dissociation.": "Lynn",

  "Conquest occurred through violence, and over-expolitation and oppression necessitate continued violence, so the army is present. There would be no contradiction in that, if terror reigned everywhere in the world, but the colonizer enjoys, in the mother country, democratic rights that the colonialist system refuses to the colonized native. In fact, the colonialist system favors population growth to reduce the cost of labor, and it forbids assimilation of the natives, whose numerical superiority, if they had voting rights, would shatter the system. Colonialism denies human rights to human beings whom it has subdued by violence, and keeps them by force in a state of misery and ignorance that Marx would rightly call a subhuman condition. Racism is ingrained in actions, institutions, and in the nature of the colonialist methods of production and exchange. Political and social regulations reinforce one another. Since the native is subhuman, the Declaration of Human Rights does not apply to him; inversely, since he has no rights, he is abandoned without protection to inhuman forces - brought in with the colonialist praxis, engendered every moment by the colonialist apparatus, and sustained by relations of production that define two sorts of individuals - one for whom privilege and humanity are one, who becomes a human being through exercising his rights; and the other, for whom a denial of rights sanctions misery, chronic hunger, ignorance, or, in general, 'subhumanity.": "Albert",

The application of violence - of killing and a willingness to be killed - on a massive scale is responsible for a lot of solutions. The most recent mass application of violence liberated Kuwait. The most recent mass application of violence on a global scale alone cleansed the world of the Third Reich. Nonviolence and passive resistance did less than nothing to stop Hitler and his henchmen. The Atlantic slave trade wasn't stopped by 'dialogue' or 'passive resistance' or conferences, but by the opened gunports of the Royal Navy; Dachau and Chang-I weren't liberated with pamphlets.": "Markham",

Applesauce drips on her chin. \"That's the way it's going to be, huh?\" I say, hoping the scene doesn't gross Alex out. Maybe I'm testing him, to see if he can handle a glimpse of my home life. If so, he's passing. \"Wait until Alex leaves. I'll show you who the checkers champion is.\"My sister smiles that sweet, crooked smile of hers. It's like a thousand words put into one expression.

  "The Buddha's original teaching is essentially a matter of four points -- the Four Noble Truths:1. Anguish is everywhere.2. We desire permanent existence of ourselves and for our loved ones, and we desire to prove ourselves independent of others and superior to them. These desires conflict with the way things are: nothing abides, and everything and everyone depends upon everything and everyone else. This conflict causes our anguish, and we project this anguish on those we meet.3. Release from anguish comes with the personal acknowledgment and resolve: we are here together very briefly, so let us accept reality fully and take care of one another while we can.4. This acknowledgement and resolve are realized by following the Eightfold Path: Right Views, Right Thinking, Right Speech, Right Conduct, Right Livelihood, Right Effort, Right Recollection, and Right Meditation.

This stance conveys the impression that human consciousness inhabits some haven, or locker-room, independent of the collective situation -- and then trots onto the playing field when it is geared up and ready.It is my experience that the world itself has a role to play in our liberation.

When it stood, the mange would eat into its skin, so it would run. Running, it was still uncomfortable, so it would stop. Standing, it was still uncomfortable, so it would lie down. Then it would jump up again, running to the underbrush, the tree hollow, never staying still. The Buddha said, \u201cMonks, did you see that jackal this afternoon? Standing, it suffered. Running, it suffered. Sitting, it suffered. Lying down, it suffered. It blamed standing for its discomfort. It blamed sitting. It blamed running and lying down. It blamed the tree, the underbrush, and the cave. In fact, the problem was with none of those things. The problem was with his mange.\u201d We are just the same as that jackal. Our discontent is due to wrong view. Because we don\u2019t exercise sense restraint, we blame our suffering on externals. Whether we live in Thailand, America or England, we aren\u2019t satisfied. Why not? Because we still have wrong view. Just that! So wherever we go, we aren\u2019t content. But just as that jackal would be content wherever it went as soon as its mange was cured, so would we be content wherever we went once we rid ourselves of wrong view.": "Ajahn",

  "In the first movement, our infancy as a species, we felt no separation from the natural world around us. Trees, rocks, and plants surrounded us with a living presence as intimate and pulsing as our own bodies. In that primal intimacy, which anthropologists call \"participation mystique,\" we were as one with our world as a child in the mother's womb.Then self-consciousness arose and gave us distance on our world. We needed that distance in order to make decisions and strategies, in order to measure, judge and to monitor our judgments. With the emergence of free-will, the fall out of the Garden of Eden, the second movement began -- the lonely and heroic journey of the ego. Nowadays, yearning to reclaim a sense of wholeness, some of us tend to disparage that movement of separation from nature, but it brought us great gains for which we can be grateful. The distanced and observing eye brought us tools of science, and a priceless view of the vast, orderly intricacy of our world. The recognition of our individuality brought us trial by jury and the Bill of Rights.Now, harvesting these gains, we are ready to return. The third movement begins. Having gained distance and sophistication of perception, we can turn and recognize who we have been all along. Now it can dawn on us: we are our world knowing itself. We can relinquish our separateness. We can come home again -- and participate in our world in a richer, more responsible and poignantly beautiful way than before, in our infancy.": "Joanna",

For instance when we have anger or hatred towards a person, there is less likelihood of its developing to a very intense degree if we leave it unattended.However, if we think about the projected injustices done to us, the ways in which we have been unfairly treated, and we keep on thinking about them over and over, then that feeds the hatred. It makes the hatred very powerful and intense. Of course, the same can apply to when we have an attachment towards a particular person; we can feed that by thinking about how beautiful he or she is, and as we keep thinking about the projected qualities that we see in the person, the attachment becomes more and more intense.

I couldn't, for example, rectify the assertion that \"alcoholism is a disease\" with the facts of my own life.The idea that by simply attending an AA meeting, without any consultation, one is expected to take on a blanket diagnosis of \"diseased addict\" was to me, at best, patronizing. At worst, irresponsible. Irresponsible because it doesn't encourage people to turn toward and heal the actual underlying causes of their abuse of substances.I drank for thirteen years for REALLY good reasons. Among them were unprocessed grief, parental abandonment, isolation, violent trauma, anxiety and panic, social oppression, a general lack of safety, deep existential discord, and a tremendous diet and lifestyle imbalance. None of which constitute a disease, and all of which manifest as profound internal, mental, emotional and physical discomfort, which I sought to escape by taking external substances.It is only through one's own efforts to turn toward life on its own terms and to develop a wiser relationship to what's there through mindfulness and compassion that make freedom from addictive patterns possible. My sobriety has been sustained by facing life, processing grief, healing family relationships, accepting radically the fact of social oppression, working with my abandonment conditioning, coming into community, renegotiating trauma, making drastic diet and lifestyle changes, forgiving, and practicing mindfulness, to name just a few.

By identifying with a craving ('I want this,\" don't want' that\"), you tighten the clutch and intensify its resistance. Instead of being a state of mind that you have, it becomes a compulsion that has you.

Our illusions dissolved, we need no longer suffer. This is only another doctrine of salvation, subtler than that of the Christians, but no different from Christianity in its goal of leaving our animal inheritance behind.

So, if you are only concerned about feeling good, you are far better off having a full body massage or listening to some uplifting or life-affirming music than receiving dharma teachings, which were definitely not designed to cheer you up. On the contrary, the dharma was devised specifically to expose your failings and make you feel awful.": "Dzongsar",
  "In all these assaults on the senses there is a great wisdom \u2014 not only about the addictiveness of pleasures but about their ephemerality. The essence of addiction, after all, is that pleasure tends to desperate and leave the mind agitated, hungry for more. The idea that just one more dollar, one more dalliance, one more rung on the ladder will leave us feeling sated reflects a misunderstanding about human nature \u2014 a misunderstanding, moreover, that is built into human nature; we are designed to feel that the next great goal will bring bliss, and the bliss is designed to evaporate shortly after we get there. Natural selection has a malicious sense of humor; it leads us along with a series of promises and then keeps saying \u2018Just kidding.\u2019 As the Bible puts it, \u2018All the labour of man is for his mouth, and yet the appetite is not filled.\u2019 Remarkably, we go our whole lives without ever really catching on.The advice of the sages \u2014 that we refuse to play this game \u2014 is nothing less than an incitement to mutiny, to rebel against our creator. Sensual pleasures are the whip natural selection uses to control us to keep us in the thrall of its warped value system. To cultivate some indifference to them is one plausible route to liberation.

And they live their lives and when it ends they are back in the place outside the universe until the big ugly cosmic dude decides he wants them back again to fuck with their heads some more, so the next time they might be a boy instead of a girl, and better looking, not so athletic, more quick tempered, less optimistic, whatever, whatever and so it goes on until they learn so much stuff that the big ugly cosmic dude can\u2019t fuck with them any more and the proto-human dudes don\u2019t get beamed into the universe any more.

As the man hangs there, a mouse crawls from a crevice just beyond his reach and begins to gnaw the vine. Death above, death below, and death in between. He sees a big ripe strawberry near his mouth. It is delicious.In this moment, flying miles above the strawberry fields of California's San Joachin Valley, I think that I would change the ending of this story.

  "What is personal death?Asking this question and pausing to look inward - isn't personal death a concept? Isn't there a thought-and-picture series going on in the brain? These scenes of personal ending take place solely in the imagination, and yet they trigger great mental ad physical distress - thinking of one's cherished attachments an their sudden, irreversible termination.Similarly, if there is 'pain when I let some of the beauty of life in' - isn't this pain the result of thinking, 'I won't be here any longer to enjoy this beauty?' Or, 'No one will be around and no beauty left to be enjoyed if there is total nuclear devastation.'Apart from the horrendous tragedy of human warfare - why is there this fear of 'me' not continuing? Is it because I don't realize that all my fear and trembling is for an image? Because I really believe that this image is myself?In the midst of this vast, unfathomable, ever-changing, dying, and renewing flow of life, the human brain is ceaselessly engaged in trying to fix for itself a state of permanency and certainty. Having the capacity to think and form pictures of ourselves, to remember them and become deeply attached to them, we take this world of pictures and ideas for real. We thoroughly believe in the reality of the picture story of our personal life. We are totally identified with it and want it to go on forever. The idea of \"forever\" is itself an invention of the human brain. Forever is a dream.Questioning beyond all thoughts, images, memories, and beliefs, questioning profoundly into the utter darkness of not-knowing, the realization may suddenly dawn that one is nothing at all - nothing - that all one has been holding on to are pictures and dreams. Being nothing is being everything. It is wholeness. Compassion. It is the ending of separation, fear, and sorrow.Is there pain when no one is there to hold on?There is beauty where there is no \"me\".": "Toni",

It stands majestic, atop the rolling hills behind the house where I grew up.Kuan Yin is at the tree looking very luminous. I see the bark of the tree, which looks very real, very three-dimensional. For some reason, Kuan Yin is touching the trunk of the tree.She suddenly seems very small next to me and she wants me to touch the tree. I\u2019m not sure why. There is a tiny bird, with pretty feathers in its nest. It is about the size of a wren. I see the texture of the tree. I think it might be a birch. I\u2019m not sure. \u2019Why should I touch the tree,\u2019 I ask.

You create your whole world with thoughts,\u201d assures Kuan Yin.\u201cEvery time I try to touch the tree, Kuan Yin wants to help me touch it. There\u2019s something different about this conversation. Usually we work on something about the earth. Because we\u2019re revisiting my childhood, I get the impression Kuan Yin\u2019s trying to show me something that maybe I created in my childhood.\u201d\u201cWell, do we all create our reality?\u201d Kuan Yin asks of Lena.\u201cI think she\u2019s going to answer her own question,\u201d comments Lena, from her trance.\u201cYes, you can create your reality.

Our way of thinking is completely dominated by these eight concerns, which the world proclaims to be of utmost importance.

Whenever we see a clock, we label it a clock, but if we were to separate the component pieces, then the \"clock\" would cease to exist, because no basis of imputation would remain.

Of course, at the time when we are looking at something, we are generally not aware of the way our feelings are being protected into the situation.Seen in this way, our so-called cognition, or the action of discerning the meaning of things as they are perceived by us, is never in any case a perception of the external world exactly as it is, but rather a world that can only be apprehended via its interface with our present mental state. In other words, it is nothing other than our own mind that constructs things and determines their content.

One first understands the root emotions as the basis for samsara, then studies the workings of the associated emotions and how each one manifests a distinctive character. Gradually, the manner in which the self supports emotion and emotion supports the sense of self becomes clear. Self and emotion are seen as relying on and reinforcing each other's existence.

  "We tend to be unaware that stars rise and set at all. This is not entirelydue to our living in cities ablaze with electric lights which reflect back at us from our fumes, smoke, and artificial haze. When I discussed the stars with a well-known naturalist, I was surprised to learn that even a man such as he, who has spent his entire lifetime observing wildlife and nature, was totally unaware of the movements of the stars. And he is no prisoner of smog-bound cities. He had no inkling, for instance, that the Little Bear could serve as a reliable night clock as it revolves in tight circles around the Pole Star (and acts as a celestial hour-hand at half speed - that is, it takes 24 hours rather than 12 for a single revolution).I wondered what could be wrong. Our modern civilization does not ignorethe stars only because most of us can no longer see them. There are definitely deeper reasons. For even if we leave the sulphurous vapours of our Gomorrahs to venture into a natural landscape, the stars do not enter into any of our back-to-nature schemes. They simply have no place in our outlook any more. We look at them, our heads flung back in awe and wonder that they can existin such profusion. But that is as far as it goes, except for the poets. This is simply a 'gee whiz' reaction. The rise in interest in astrology today does not result in much actual star-gazing. And as for the space programme's impact on our view of the sky, many people will attentively follow the motions of a visible satellite against a backdrop of stars whose positions are absolutely meaningless to them. The ancient mythological figures sketched in the sky were taught us as children to be quaint 'shepherds' fantasies' unworthy of the attention of adult minds. We are interested in the satellite because we made it, but the stars are alien and untouched by human hands - therefore vapid. To such a level has our technological mania, like a bacterial solution in which we have been stewed from birth, reduced us.It is only the integral part of the landscape which can relate to the stars.Man has ceased to be that. He inhabits a world which is more and more his own fantasy. Farmers relate to the skies, as well as sailors, camel caravans,and aerial navigators. For theirs are all integral functions involving the fundamental principle - now all but forgotten - of orientation. But in analmost totally secular and artificial world, orientation is thought to be un- necessary. And the numbers of people in insane asylums or living at home doped on tranquilizers testifies to our aimless, drifting metaphysic. And to our having forgotten orientation either to seasons (except to turn on the air- conditioning if we sweat or the heating system if we shiver) or to direction (our one token acceptance of cosmic direction being the wearing of sun-glasses because the sun is 'over there').We have debased what was once the integral nature of life channelled by cosmic orientations - a wholeness - to the ennervated tepidity of skin sensations and retinal discomfort. Our interior body clocks, known as circadian rhythms, continue to operate inside us, but find no contact with the outside world.They therefore become ingrown and frustrated cycles which never interlock with our environment. We are causing ourselves to become meaningless body machines programmed to what looks, in its isolation, to be an arbitrary set of cycles. But by tearing ourselves from our context, like the still-beating heart ripped out of the body of an Aztec victim, we inevitably do violence to our psyches. I would call the new disease, with its side effect of 'alienation of the young', dementia temporalis.": "Robert",

  "I don't think I'm from this galaxy at all. I believe I came from the Andromeda galaxy, not so far, but far enough. Maybe that's why I'm an outcast.' He drew the spiral of Andromeda close to the Milky Way, almost touching. Then he pointed to Andromeda in the night sky above us.'Maybe that's where I'm from too,' my father said. We could still see the stars.": "Hannah",

  "I rocketed a commanding finger to the heavens and it rained stardust upon our young heads.": "K.B.",
  "I wrapped my fingers around the first light I saw and felt all at once so happy and so sad and so free. My hand was cold somehow as I lifted the tiny star out of the water and brought its trembling, burning form to my face. I kissed it gently and laughed like a child as my face seemed to become angelic for a few moments. The star laughed back at me in little sweet notes, and I released it back to the sea. I can still feel the star in my hands to this day. You can have your noctiluca scintillans, your petty protists in the sea. I prefer to sail among the stars.": "K.B.",
  "They forget that love is not a science but an inherent state of mind; they forget that sex is practiced by animals without textbooks and that it is not such a secret that requires a complete science, courses and special training. And so impotent, with artificial stars on the ceilings of their rooms, they become the main teachers on the way to the stars.": "Dejan",
  "Everything is alive, everything is in motion, everything corresponds; the magnetic rays that emanate from me or from others flow directly through the infinite chain of creation whose transparent network is in continuous communication with the planets and the stars. A captive here on earth for the moment, I commune with the chorus of stars and they join in my sorrows and joys.": "G\u00e9rard",
  "If you had stars inside your brain cells, you'd probably understand what I am talking about.": "Ernest",

  "Good strategy, keep the conversation going until a guard notices the bodies outside the door. Maybe bursts in to save you. Not a bad idea.": "C.M.",
  "We walk up the beach under the stars. We feel stretched, expanded to take in their compass. They pour into us until we are filled with stars, up to the brim.This is what one thirsts for, I realize, after the smallness of the day, of work, of details, of intimacy\u2014even of communication, one thirsts for the magnitude and universality of a night full of stars, pouring into one like a fresh tide.": "Anne",
  "There seemed to be handfuls of stars tossed right above the rooftops in Haddan, keeping the town still alight at midnight.": "Alice",

  "When the stars imploded billions of years ago, iron and silver, gold and carbon came raining down. And the iron from that stardust is in us today-in our mitochondria. Mothers pass on the stars and their iron to their children. Who knows, Jean, you and I might be made of the dust from one and the same star, and maybe we recognized each other by its light. We were searching for each other. We are star seekers.": "Nina",
  "If this were an indie movie, we'd start talking about the constellations,\" Solomon said, looking up at the stars.": "John",
  "Above and behind them the Dipper turned on its great handle as if to pour night itself out onto the dreaming continent and each of its seven stars gleamed from between the fitful clouds.": "Paulette",
  "Your sky is full of stars and my arms too short to reach a piece to call my own": "Robert",
  "I think I would make a very good astronaut.To be a good astronaut you have to be intelligent and I\u2019m intelligent. You also have to understand how machines work and I\u2019m good at understanding how machines work. You also have to be someone who would like being on their own in a tiny spacecraft thousands and thousands of miles away from the surface of the earth and not panic or get claustrophobia or homesick or insane. And I really like little spaces, so long as there is no one else in them with me. Sometimes when I want to be on my own I get into the airing cupboard outside the bathroom and slide in beside the boiler and pull the door closed behind me and sit there and think for hours and it makes me feel very calm.So I would have to be an astronaut on my own, or have my own part of the space craft which no one else could come into.And also there are no yellow things or brown things in a space craft, so that would be okay too.And I would have to talk to other people from Mission Control, but we would do that through a radio linkup and a TV monitor, so they wouldn\u2019t be like real people who are strangers, but it would be like playing a computer game.Also I wouldn\u2019t be homesick at all because I\u2019d be surrounded by things I like, which are machines and computers and outer space. And I would be able to look out of a little window in the spacecraft and know that there was no one near me for thousands and thousands of miles, which is what I sometimes pretend at night in the summer when I go and lie on the lawn and look up at the sky and I put my hands round the sides of my face so that I can\u2019t see the fence and the chimney and the washing line and I can pretend I\u2019m in space.And all I could see would be stars. And stars are the places where molecules that life is made of were constructed billions of years ago. For example, all the iron in your blood which keeps you from being anemic was made in a star.And I would like it if I could take Toby with me into space, and that might be allowed because they sometimes do take animals into space for experiments, so if I could think of a good experiment you could do with a rat that didn\u2019t hurt the rat, I could make them let me take Toby.But if they didn\u2019t let me I would still go because it would be a Dream Come True.": "Mark",
  "As time passes in Heaven, the stars do not change places, not till the day when Zig changes the complete backdrop. I tell my students this is a metaphor for life; we go along thinking nothing will be different, till the day everything suddenly changes at once.": "Neil",
  ", And you, ye stars,Who slowly begin to marshal,As of old, the fields of heaven,Your distant, melancholy lines!Have you, too, survived yourselves?Are you, too, what I fear to become?You, too, once lived;You, too, moved joyfullyAmong august companions,In an older world, peopled by Gods,In a mightier order,The radiant, rejoicing, intelligent Sons of Heaven.But now, ye kindleYour lonely, cold-shining lights,Unwilling lingerersIn the heavenly wilderness,For a younger, ignoble world;And renew, by necessity,Night after night your courses,In echoing, unneared silence,Above a race you know not\u2014Uncaring and undelighted,Without friend and without home;Weary like us, though notWeary with our weariness.": "Matthew",

  "The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,They are all fire and every one doth shine": "William",
  "That's why I like the blackest nights-the darkest, obsidian skies of winter. When the world is coldest and darkest, the stars shine brightest.": "Julie",
  "...the stars are fixed in rooftops like ink.": "Jack",
  "The truth is that he wanted to draw a little comfort from gazing at the stars. There were still one or two up there, at the zenith. As always, seeing them revived him; they were distant, they were omnipotent and at the same time they were docile to his calculations; just the contrary to humans, always too near, so weak and yet so quarrelsome.": "Giuseppe",
  "I tilted my head back, breathing deeply. It was a clear, moonless night, and after those long months underground, the sight of all that sky was dizzying. And so many stars\u2014a glittering, tangled mass that seemed close enough to touch. I let their light fall over me like a balm, grateful for the air in my lungs, the night all around me.": "Leigh",
  "The night had a nearly liquid quality, was like sliding into a warm swimming pool, a pool filled with buoyant darkenss instead of water.": "Joe",
  "The stars were extra bright tonight, and they shone and glimmered as if each one had something it wanted to say.": "Chris",
  "You are no star, Gabby. You're the sky. The rest of us are just circling your orbit.": "Kelly",
  "Looking up at that starry sky gave him the creeps: it was too big, too black. It was all too possible to imagine it turning blood-red, all too possible to imagine a Face forming in lines of fire.": "Stephen",
  "People are like stars in the Milky Way. There are millions of them. There are big, small, dead, and dying stars out there. Hindi ikaw ang nag-iisang bituin d'yan sa langit, kaya hindi sa'yo umiikot ang mundo. Puweding makinang ka ngayon, pero asahan mong parating may darating na mas makinang pa sa'yo. Malaki ang posibilidad na mawala sa'yo ang atensiyon ng iba, pero tandaan mo ang isang bagay.\"Whatever happens, you're still a star. There will still be people looking at you, admiring your beauty, and wishing for great things to happen to them with your help. You can't let them down, so you have to continue shining for them. You have to show them directions. That's what stars are for.": "Luna",
  "Have you ever imagined walking with me? A long walk on an empty road, on a cold night. Where there is no one around, except us. My hand touches yours, in the name of sweet accidents. The stars decide to shine and the galaxies decide to burst inside me, instead of the sky. And all of a sudden, my hands try to play with your fingers. Until my fingers fill the gaps between yours.": "Akshay",

  "Enthusiasm is the yeast that makes your hopes shine to the stars.": "Henry",
  "All summers take me back to the sea. There in the long eelgrass, like birds' eggs waiting to be hatched, my brothers and sister and I sit, grasses higher than our heads, arms and legs like thicker versions of the grass waving in the wind, looking up at the blue sky. My mother is gathering food for dinner: clams and mussels and the sharply salty greens that grow by the shore. It is warm enough to lie here in the little silty puddles like bathwater left in the tub after the plug has been pulled. It is the beginning of July and we have two months to live out the long, nurturing days, watching the geese and the saltwater swans and the tides as they are today, slipping out, out, out as the moon pulls the other three seasons far away wherever it takes things. Out past the planets, far away from Uranus and the edge of our solar system, into the brilliantly lit dark where the things we don't know about yet reside. Out past my childhood, out past the ghosts, out past the breakwater of the stars. Like the silvery lace curtains of my bedroom being drawn from my window, letting in light, so the moon gently pulls back the layers of the year, leaving the best part open and free. So summer comes to me.": "Polly",
  "I leaned back and glimpsed the stars, the same stories again but written in the sky.": "Wesley",
  "When Compasia took pity on me, she reached down into the Underworld, touched the shoulder of Moritas, and asked her forgiveness. Then Compasia took my sister in her arms and placed her in the sky, where she, too, turned to stardust.Magiano looks at me, his eyes wide. It seems as if he already, somehow, understands.\u201cMy goddess made me a promise,\u201d I whisper.Only now do I realize that I have never seen him cry before.In the stories, Compasia and her human lover would descend each night from the stars to walk the mortal world, before vanishing with the dawn. So, together, we stare at the sky, waiting.": "Marie",
  "I will howl with the wolves, soar above the eagles and roam wild with the Mustang.

  "Tonight I feel like a shooting star, but I hope my shine will last much longer.": "Bernard",
  "When she was little, she'd liked to pretend that stars were really lights anchoring distant islands, as if she wasn't looking up but only out across a dark sea. She knew the truth now but still found stars comforting, especially in their sameness. A sky full of burning replicas.": "Lauren",
  "Perhaps stars were supposed to be viewed from the ground.": "Becky",
  "And strange-eyed constellations reignHis stars eternally.": "Thomas",

  "And he will never know what it is to look up at the night sky and wish.": "Sarah",
  "And it sucks, because I want to kiss her. It's infuriating how perfect it would be to kiss her right now, perched on a cannon on a pirate ship under the stars. That sounds like something off the pages of an adventure novel. But my life isn't one of those stories. My story is a hurricane, and here with Swift is just the eye.": "Emily",

Perseus, flying by, fell in love with Andromeda and saved her. In the sky, she's pictured with her arms outstretched and her hands chained.": "Jodi",
  "Stars are fires that burn for thousands of years. Some of them burn slow and long, like red dwarfs. Others-blue giants-burn their due so fast they shine across great distances, and are easy to see. As they Starr to run out of fuel,they burn helium, grow even hotter, and explode in a supernova. Supernovas, they're brighter than the brightest galaxies. They die, but everyone watches them go.": "Jodi",

  "The night embraces me, cool and endless, and above me the stars are tiny holes in the darkness through which the light of eternity is pouring out.

  "The new father finally hangs up the phone, laughing at absolutely nothing. \"Congratulations,\" I say, when what I really want to tell him is to pick up that baby of his and hold her tight, to set the moon on the edge of her crib and to hang her name up in stars so that she never, ever does to him what I have done to my parents.": "Jodi",

  "Star-watching: at night the stars of Alastor Cluster blaze in profusion. The atmosphere refracts their light; the sky quivers with beams, glitters, and errant flashes.

  "How strange it was, I thought, that when the tiny though thousandfold beauties of the Earth disappeared and the immeasurable beauty of outer space rose in the distant quiet splendor of light, man and the greatest number of other creatures were supposed to be asleep! Was it because we were only permitted to catch a fleeting glimpse of those great bodies and then only in the mysterious time of a dream world, those great bodies about which man had only the slightest knowledge but perhaps one day would be permitted to examine more closely?

What causes its rapid descent from heaven?''Do you then put faith in stars, Amine?''In Araby we do; and why not? They were not spread over the sky to give light\u2014for what then?''To beautify the world. They have their uses, too.''Then you agree with me\u2014they have their uses, and the destinies of men are there concealed. My mother was one of those who could read them well. Alas! For me they are a sealed book.''Is it not better so, Amine?''Better!\u2014say better to grovel on this earth with our selfish, humbled race, wandering in mystery and awe, and doubt, when we can communicate with the intelligences above! Does not the soul leap at her admission to confer with superior powers? Does not the proud heart bound at the feeling that its owner is one of those more gifted than the usual race of mortals?

  "She herself, as she had said, was oddly enjoying the snowy night. She had seldom had reason to be abroad in such weather at night, and she had forgotten, or never noticed, how clear the sky was or how brightly the stars twinkled down. They might have been the only ones alive in the whole world, for it was deadly still, the eerie light giving the night almost a magical quality. Everyday items were rendered mysterious and beautiful by their layer of white, and the only sounds were those they made, of creaking leather and the crisp squeak of snow underfoot.": "Dawn",
  "Courtesy, not control, that was His means.

  "Smiling now, Michael Dawn sat on his rooftop, gazing at the stars above him, just like men had done for thousands of years. Out there lay secrets and mysteries that an eternity could never unravel, worlds he could only imagine. Yet looking at them then, it all seemed so surreal. As if the only purpose the stars had in this world was to shine their tiny points of light down on him that evening. To give him something beautiful and breathtaking to admire. Maybe that was their only purpose. Maybe trying to get more out of them, trying to travel among them and shed light on things that were better left unexposed, had been the trouble all along.": "John",
  "In cities it is useless to look at the stars or to describe them, worship them, or seek direction from them. When lost, one should follow the tracks of the camels.": "Rawi",
  "I put back my head, looking up at the deep black sky swimming with hot stars. If you knew they were really balls of flaming gas, you could imagine them as Van Gogh saw them, without difficulty . . . and looking into that illuminated void, you understood why people have always looked up into the sky when talking to God.

  "But if a man be alone, let him look at the stars. The rays that come from those heavenly worlds, will separate between him and vulgar things. One might think the atmosphere was made transparent with this design, to give man, in the heavenly bodies, the perpetual presence of the sublime. Seen in the streets of cities, how great they are! If the stars should appear one night in a thousand years, how would men believe and adore; and preserve for many generations the remembrance of the city of God which had been shown! But every night come out these envoys of beauty, and light the universe with their admonishing smile.": "Ralph",

  "Consider now the Milky Way. Here also we see an innumerable dust, only the grains of this dust are no longer atoms but stars; these grains also move with great velocities, they act at a distance one upon another, but this action is so slight at great distances that their trajectories are rectilineal; nevertheless, from time to time, two of them may come near enough together to be deviated from their course, like a comet that passed too close to Jupiter. In a word, in the eyes of a giant, to whom our Suns were what our atoms are to us, the Milky Way would only look like a bubble of gas.": "Henri",
  "And what is I was only supposed to burn for a certain amount of time?\" I whispered. \"What if I was only meant to shine for a while?\"\"Then you truly don't know what stars are meant to do.\"I looked at him in wonder.\"They are meant to give us hope in the face of infinity\".": "Karina",

  "Ralph Waldo Emerson once asked what we would do if the stars only came out once every thousand years. No one would sleep that night, of course. The world would create new religions overnight.

  "Bette Davis lived long enough to hear the Kim Carnes song, 'Bette Davis Eyes'. The lyrics to that song were not very interesting. But the fact of the song was the proof of an acknowledgement that in the twentieth century we lived through an age of immense romantic personalities larger than life, yet models for it, too - for good or ill. Like twin moons, promising a struggle and an embrace, the Davis eyes would survive her - and us. Kim Carnes has hardly had a consistent career, but that one song - sluggish yet surging, druggy and dreamy - became an instant classic. It's like the sigh of the islanders when they behold their Kong. And I suspect it made the real eyes smile, whatever else was on their mind.": "David",

  "I went outside. Tried taking in the billions of stars above, lingering long enough to allow each point of light the chance to scratch a deep hole in the back of my retina, so that when I finally did turn to face the dark surrounding forest I thought I saw the billion eyes of a billion cats blinking out, in the math of the living, the sum of the universe, the stories of history , a life older than anyone could have ever imagined. And even after they were gone--fading away together, as if they really were one--something still lingered in those sweet folds of black pine , sitting quietly, almost as if it too were waiting for something to wake.": "Mark",
  "And now, I needed the stars. Not the explosive ones that hurled out tongues of gas and, along with gravity, hammered out the planets.

By now there's not a constellation I can't name. Orion. Lupus. Serpens. Hercules. Draco. My father taught me all of their stories. So when I look up I see a galaxy of adventures and heroes and villains, all jostling together and trying to outdo one another, and I sometimes want to tell them to hush up and not distract me with their chatter.

  "I had travelled from Spain into Morocco and from there south to the Atlas Mountains, at the edge of the Sahara Desert\u2026one night, in a youth hostel that was more like a stable, I woke and walked out into a snowstorm. But it wasn\u2019t the snow I was used to in Minnesota, or anywhere else I had been. Standing bare chest to cool night, wearing flip-flops and shorts, I let a storm of stars swirl around me. I remember no light pollution, heck, I remember no lights. But I remember the light around me-the sense of being lit by starlight- and that I could see the ground to which the stars seemed to be floating down. I saw the sky that night in three dimensions- the sky had depth, some stars seemingly close and some much farther away, the Milky Way so well defined it had what astronomers call \u201cstructure\u201d, that sense of its twisting depths. I remember stars from one horizon to another, making a night sky so plush it still seems like a dream.It was a time in my life when I was every day experiencing something new. I felt open to everything, as though I was made of clay, and the world was imprinting on me its breathtaking beauty (and terrible reality.)

If indeed the numbers and distances of the night sky are so large that they become nearly meaningless, then let us find the meaning under our feet.": "Paul",
  "When I lie back and close my eyes, this farthest lip of beach right next to the end of the ocean feels like being up close to an enormous breathing being, the bass drum surf thump reverberating through the sand. Living out here with no lights, alone, you would indeed become sensitive to seasons, rhythms, weather, sounds- right up next to the sea, right up under the sky, like lying close to a lover\u2019s skin to hear blood and breath and heartbeat.": "Paul",
  "I compared what was really known about the stars with the account of creation as told in Genesis. I found that the writer of the inspired book had no knowledge of astronomy -- that he was as ignorant as a Choctaw chief -- as an Eskimo driver of dogs. Does any one imagine that the author of Genesis knew anything about the sun -- its size? that he was acquainted with Sirius, the North Star, with Capella, or that he knew anything of the clusters of stars so far away that their light, now visiting our eyes, has been traveling for two million years?If he had known these facts would he have said that Jehovah worked nearly six days to make this world, and only a part of the afternoon of the fourth day to make the sun and moon and all the stars?Yet millions of people insist that the writer of Genesis was inspired by the Creator of all worlds.Now, intelligent men, who are not frightened, whose brains have not been paralyzed by fear, know that the sacred story of creation was written by an ignorant savage. The story is inconsistent with all known facts, and every star shining in the heavens testifies that its author was an uninspired barbarian.I admit that this unknown writer was sincere, that he wrote what he believed to be true -- that he did the best he could. He did not claim to be inspired -- did not pretend that the story had been told to him by Jehovah. He simply stated the \"facts\" as he understood them.After I had learned a little about the stars I concluded that this writer, this \"inspired\" scribe, had been misled by myth and legend, and that he knew no more about creation than the average theologian of my day. In other words, that he knew absolutely nothing.And here, allow me to say that the ministers who are answering me are turning their guns in the wrong direction. These reverend gentlemen should attack the astronomers. They should malign and vilify Kepler, Copernicus, Newton, Herschel and Laplace. These men were the real destroyers of the sacred story. Then, after having disposed of them, they can wage a war against the stars, and against Jehovah himself for having furnished evidence against the truthfulness of his book.": "Robert",

  "My feeling is that an observer needs to see four hundred and fifty stars to get that feeling of infinitude, and be swept away\u2026and I didn\u2019t make that number up arbitrarily, that\u2019s the number of stars that are available once you get dimmer than third magnitude. So in the city, you see a dozen stars, a handful, and it\u2019s attractive to no one. And if there\u2019s a hundred stars in the sky it still doesn\u2019t do it. There\u2019s a certain tipping point where people will look and there will be that planetarium view.

  "I realized I still had my eyes shut. I had shut them when I put my face to the screen, like I was scared to look outside. Now I had to open them. I looked out the window and saw for the first time how the hospital was out in the country. The moon was low in the sky over the pastureland; the face of it was scarred and scuffed where it had just torn up out of the snarl of scrub oak and madrone trees on the horizon. The stars up close to the moon were pale; they got brighter and braver the farther they got out of the circle of light ruled by the giant moon. I was off on a hunt with Papa and the uncles and I lay rolled in blankets Grandma had woven, lying off a piece from where the men hunkered around the fire as they passed a quart jar of cactus liquor in a silent circle. I watched that big Oregon prairie moon above me put all the stars around it to shame.

  "The moon went slowly down in loveliness; she departed into the depth of the horizon, and long veil-like shadows crept up the sky through which the stars appeared. Soon, however, they too began to pale before a splendour in the east, and the advent of the dawn declared itself in the newborn blue of heaven. Quieter and yet more quiet grew the sea, quiet as the soft mist that brooded on her bosom, and covered up her troubling, as in our tempestuous life the transitory wreaths of sleep brook upon a pain-racked soul, causing it to forget its sorrow. From the east to the west sped those angels of the Dawn, from sea to sea, from mountain-top to mountain-top, scattering light from breast and wing. On they sped out of the darkness, perfect, glorious; on, over the quiet sea, over the low coast-line, and the swamps beyond, and the mountains above them; over those who slept in peace and those who woke in sorrow; over the evil and the good; over the living and the dead; over the wide world and all that breathes or as breathed thereon.": "H.",

  "Sometimes the novel is not ready to be written because you haven't met the inspiration for your main character yet. Sometimes you need two more years of life experience before you can make your masterpiece into something that will feel real and true and raw to other people. Sometimes you're not falling in love because whatever you need to know about yourself is only knowable through solitude. Sometimes you haven't met your next collaborator. Sometimes your sadness encircles you because, one day, it will be the opus upon which you build your life.We all know this: Our experience cannot always be manipulated. Yet, we don't act as though we know this truth. We try so hard to manipulate and control our lives, to make creativity into a game to win, to shortcut success because others say they have, to process emotions and uncertainty as if these are linear journeys.You don't get to game the system of your life. You just don't. You don't get to control every outcome and aspect as a way to never give in to the uncertainty and unpredictability of something that's beyond what you understand.

  "I was exhausted and had to rely on Herr Schreiner to help me and knew in my soul that God had sent him to my aid. As tired as I was, I couldn\u2019t have handled my luggage alone. Finally another train did pull into the station but in stark contrast to the empty platform we were standing on, the train was completely full of people. Although he wasn\u2019t that big of a man, Herr Schreiner pushed my suitcases up the two steps into the railway car, and I climbed up behind them. As the train left the station, he hung onto the two entrance handles right behind me and I pushed for space, trying to make enough room for him to get into the carriage. With every surge of the train I expected him to lose his grip but with what I am certain was superhuman strength, he hung on as the train picked up speed. Several of the people made snide remarks but I turned a deaf ear to this and pushed as hard as I could, so that he could also get in. With the help of another man pulling on his coat, Herr Schreiner finally managed to squeeze in far enough so that we could close the door behind him. Once safely on the train, someone from his school in Mannheim recognized him. Herr Schreiner had been a very popular, much admired school principal and seeing how tired and bedraggled we now looked, the passenger offered us his window seats and helped to make room so that we could store our suitcases in the luggage rack above our heads. The train didn\u2019t make any more stops and continued east crossing the Rhine River Bridge, which miraculously was still there.

  "In life,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are no essentially major or minor characters. To that extent, all fiction and biography, and most historiography, are a lie. Everyone is necessarily the hero of his own life story. Hamlet could be told from Polonius\u2019s point of view and called The Tragedy of Polonius, Lord Chamberlain of Denmark. He didn\u2019t think he was a minor character in anything, I daresay. Or suppose you\u2019re an usher in a wedding. From the groom\u2019s viewpoint he\u2019s the major character; the others play supporting parts, even the bride. From your viewpoint, though, the wedding is a minor episode in the very interesting history of your life, and the bridge and groom both are minor figures. What you\u2019ve done is choose to play the part of a minor character: it can be pleasant for you to pretend to be less important you know you are, as Odysseus does when he disguises as a swineherd. And every member of the congregation at the wedding sees himself as the major character, condescending to witness the spectacle. So in this sense fiction isn\u2019t a lie at all, but a true representation of the distortion that everyone makes of life.\t\u201cNow, not only are we the heroes of our own life stories\u2013we\u2019re the ones who conceive the story, and give other people the essences of minor characters. But since no man\u2019s life story as a rule is ever one story with a coherent plot, we\u2019re always reconceiving just the sort of hero we are, and consequently just the sort of minor roles that other people are supposed to play. This is generally true. If any man displays almost the same character day in and day out, all day long, it\u2019s either because he has no imagination, like an actor who can play only one role, or because he has an imagination so comprehensive that he sees each particular situation of his life as an episode in some grand over-all plot, and can so distort the situations that the same type of hero can deal with them all. But this is most unusual.\t\u201cThis kind of role-assigning is myth-making, and when it\u2019s done consciously or unconsciously for the purpose of aggrandizing or protecting your ego\u2013and it\u2019s probably done for this purpose all the time\u2013it becomes Mythotherapy. Here\u2019s the point: an immobility such as you experienced that time in Penn Station is possible only to a person who for some reason or other has ceased to participate in Mythotherapy. At that time on the bench you were neither a major nor a minor character: you were no character at all. It\u2019s because this has happened once that it\u2019s necessary for me to explain to you something that comes quite naturally to everyone else. It\u2019s like teaching a paralytic how to walk again.": "John",

This happens to parents, for instance, when their children grow older, and to lovers when one of them begins to dislike the other.

Perhaps\u2013I\u2019m just suggesting an offhand possibility\u2013you could change to thinking of me as The Sagacious Old Mentor, a kind of Machiavellian Nestor, say, and yourself as The Ingenuous But Promising Young Prot\u00e9g\u00e9, a young Alexander, who someday will put all these teachings into practice and far outshine the master. Do you get the idea? Or\u2013this is repugnant, but it could be used as a last resort\u2013The Silently Indignant Young Man, who tolerates the ravings of a Senile Crank but who will leave this house unsullied by them. I call this repugnant because if you ever used it you\u2019d cut yourself off from much that you haven\u2019t learned yet.\t\u201cIt\u2019s extremely important that you learn to assume these masks wholeheartedly. Don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything behind them: ego means I, and I means ego, and the ego by definition is a mask. Where there\u2019s no ego\u2013this is you on the bench\u2013there\u2019s no I. If you sometimes have the feeling that your mask is insincere\u2013impossible word!\u2013it\u2019s only because one of your masks is incompatible with another. You mustn\u2019t put on two at a time. There\u2019s a source of conflict, and conflict between masks, like absence of masks, is a source of immobility. The more sharply you can dramatize your situation, and define your own role and everybody else\u2019s role, the safer you\u2019ll be.

[C]ognitive neuroscientists have not only exorcised the ghost but have shown that the brain does not even have a part that does exactly what the ghost is supposed to do: review all the facts and make a decision for the rest of the brain to carry out.

Christ comes not in the form of those who visit the imprisoned but in the imprisoned being cared for. And to be clear, Christ does not come to us as the poor and hungry. Because, as anyone for whom the poor are not an abstraction but actual flesh-and-blood people knows, the poor and hungry and imprisoned are not a romantic special class of \u2009Christlike people. And those who meet their needs are not a romantic special class of \u2009Christlike people. We all are equally as sinful and saintly as the other. No, Christ comes to us in the needs of the poor and hungry, needs that are met by another so that the gleaming redemption of \u2009God might be known. ... No one gets to play Jesus.

I turned 21. There\u2019s no getting around it. I\u2019m an adult now. Navigating the world has proved harder than I expected. There were times I was reckless.

  "The history of the own that is grasped on too small a scale and the foreign that is treated too badly reaches an end at the moment when a global co-immunity structure is born, with a respectful inclusion of individual cultures, particular interests and local solidarities. This structure would take on planetary dimensions at the moment when the earth spanned by networks and built over by foams, was conceived as the own, and the previously dominant exploitative excess as the foreign. With this turn, the concretely universal would become operational. The helpless whole is transformed into a unity capable of being protected. A romanticism of brotherliness is replaced by a cooperative logic. Humanity becomes a political concept. Its members are no longer travellers on the ship of fools that is abstract universalism, but workers on the consistently concrete and discrete project of a global immune design. Although communism was a conglomeration of a few correct ideas and many wrong ones, its reasonable part - the understanding that shared life interests of the highest order can only be realized within a horizon of universal co-operative asceticisms - will have to assert itself anew sooner or later. It presses for a macrostructure of global immunizations : co-immunism.": "Peter",

Did the New York strip steak you attacked at dinner suddenly show a mouth filled with needle-sharp teeth, and did it snap off the end of your fork, the last solid-gold fork from the set Anastasia pressed into your hands as they took her away to be shot? Is the slab under your apartment building moaning that it cannot stand the weight on its back a moment longer, and is the building stretching and creaking? Did a good friend betray you today, or did that good friend merely keep silent and fail to come to your aid? Are you holding the razor at your throat this very instant?

  "Fear and anxiety affect decision making in the direction of more caution and risk aversion... Traumatized individuals pay more attention to cues of threat than other experiences, and they interpret ambiguous stimuli and situations as threatening (Eyesenck, 1992), leading to more fear-driven decisions. In people with a dissociative disorder, certain parts are compelled to focus on the perception of danger. Living in trauma-time, these dissociative parts immediately perceive the present as being \"just like\" the past and \"emergency\" emotions such as fear, rage, or terror are immediately evoked, which compel impulsive decisions to engage in defensive behaviors (freeze, flight, fight, or collapse). When parts of you are triggered, more rational and grounded parts may be overwhelmed and unable to make effective decisions.": "Suzette",

Then, when she refused to believe it, after the second, and the third, agreed, she thought again, what a pity I wasted all those years worrying about the worst.

It\u2019s a pity that nothing can be solved in this world. Yet there never was and here never will be anyone who would commit suicide for this reason. So much for the power that intellectual anxiety has over the total anxiety of our being! That is why I prefer the dramatic life, consumed by inner fires and tortured by destiny, to the intellectual, caught up in abstractions which do not engage the essence of our subjectivity. I despise the absence of risks, madness and passion in abstract thinking. How fertile live, passionate thinking is! Lyricism feeds it like blood pumped into the heart!": "Emil",

It would happen so fast, his body shaking to release the tension that built up from all the thoughts swirling through his mind and all the air he was having trouble breathing and all the loud beating of his own heart ringing in his ears.

If, on the other hand, he is aware that horrors may be in store for him and is praying for the virtues, wherewith to meet them, and meanwhile concerning himself with the Present because there, and there alone, all duty, all grace, all knowledge, and all pleasure dwell, his state is very undesirable and should be attacked at once.": "C.S.",

  "anxiety, with its concomitant feelings of helplessness, isolation, and conflict, is an exceedingly painful experience. One tends to be angry and resentful toward those responsible for placing him in such a situation of pain. Clinical experience yields many examples like the following: A dependent person, finding himself in a situation of responsibility with which he feels he cannot cope, reacts with hostility both toward those who have placed him in the situation and toward those (usually parents) who caused him to be unable to cope with it. Or he feels hostility toward his therapist, whom he believes should bail him out": "Rollo",
  "I'm the problem of anxiety we must, therefore, always ask the question of what vital value is being threatened": "Rollo",

The person may very often state himself that the occasion of his anxiety is a relatively minor event, that his apprehension is 'silly,' and he may be angry with himself for letting such a minor thing bother him; but he still feels it.": "Rollo",
  "Our feelings of anxiety are genuine but confused signals that something is amiss, and so need to be listened to and patiently interpreted -- processes which are unlikely to be completed when we have to hand, in the computer, one of the most powerful tools of distraction ever invented.

  "Neurotic anxiety, therefore, is that which occurs when the incapacity for coping adequately with threats is not objective but subjective - I.e., is due not to objective weakness but to inner psychological patterns and conflicts which prevent the individual from using his powers.": "Rollo",
  "The threat, thus, in anxiety is not necessarily more intense than fear. Rather, it attacks us on a deeper level. The threat must be to something in the 'core' or 'essence' of the personality. My self-esteem, my experience of myself as a person, my feeling of being of worth - all of these are imperfect descriptions of what is threatened.": "Rollo",
  "One means of allaying anxiety is frantic activity. The anxiety arising out of the dilemma of powerlessness in the face of suprapersonal economic forces on one hand, but theoretical belief in the efficacy of individual effort on the other, was symptomized partly by excessive activism.": "Rollo",

  "A phobia is an excessive or unreasonable fear of an object, situation or place. Phobias are quite common and often take root in childhood for no apparent reason. Other times they spring from traumatic events or develop from an attempt to make sense of unexpected and intense feelings of anxiety or panic.Simple phobias are fears of specific things such as insects, infections, or even flying. Agoraphobia is a fear of being in places where one feels trapped or unable to get help, such as in crowds, on a bus or in a car, or standing in a line. It is basically an anxiety that ignites from being in places or situations from which escape might be difficult (or embarrassing). A social phobia is a marked fear of social or performance situations.When the phobic person actually encounters, or even anticipates, being in the presence of the feared object or situation, immediate anxiety can be triggered. The physical symptoms of anxiety may include shortness of breath, sweating, a racing heart, chest or abdominal discomfort, trembling, and similar reactions. The emotional component involves an intense fear and may include feelings of losing control, embarrassing oneself, or passing out.Most people who experience phobias try to escape or avoid the feared situation wherever possible. This may be fairly easy if the feared object is rarely encountered (such as snakes) and avoidance will not greatly restrict the person\u2019s life. At other times, avoiding the feared situation (in the case of agoraphobia, social phobia) is not easily done. After all, we live in a world filled with people and places. Having a fear of such things can limit anyone\u2019s life significantly, and trying to escape or avoid a feared object or situation because of feelings of fear about that object or situation can escalate and make the feelings of dread and terror even more pronounced.In some situations of phobias, the person may have specific thoughts that contribute some threat to the feared situation. This is particularly true for social phobia, in which there is often a fear of being negatively evaluated by others, and for agoraphobia, in which there may be a fear of passing out or dying with no one around to help, and of having a panic attack where one fears making a fool of oneself in the presence of other people.Upon recognizing their problem for what it is, men should take heart in knowing that eighty percent of people who seek help can experience improvement of symptoms or, in male-speak, the illness can be \u201cfixed.": "Sahar",

Eternal life is realized when the last trace of difference between \"I\" and \"now\" has vanished - when there is just this \"now\" and nothing else.By contrast, hell or \"everlasting damnation\" is not the everlastingness of time going on forever, but of the unbroken circle, the continuity and frustration of going round and round in pursuit of something which can never be attained. Hell is the fatuity, the everlasting impossibility, of self-love, self-consciousness, and self-possession. It is trying to see one\u00b4s own eyes, hear one\u00b4s own ears, and kiss one\u00b4s own lips.": "Alan",

Never has anything been achieved by scolding. If there are losses, let me bear them. I am very pleased with this journey I made the acquaintance of many different people, a Brahmin befriended me, children rode on my knees, peasants showed me their fields, and no one took me for a tradesman.\"\"How very lovely!\" Kamaswami cried out indignantly. \"But in fact a tradesman is just what you are! Or did you undertake this journey solely for your own pleasure?\"\"Certainly.\" Siddhartha laughed. \"Certainly I undertook the journey for my pleasure. Why else? I got to know new people and regions, enjoyed kindness and trust, found friendship. You see, dear friend, had I been Kamaswami, I'd have hurried home in bad spirits the moment I saw my purchase foiled, and indeed money and time would have been lost. But by staying on as I did, I had some agreeable days, learned things, and enjoyed pleasures, harming neither myself nor others with haste and bad spirits. And if ever I should return to this place, perhaps to buy some future harvest or for whatever other purpose, I shall be greeted happily and in friendship by friendly people and I shall praise myself for not having displayed haste and displeasure on my first visit.

Fuck you! I am sick and fucking tired of this bullshit. I refuse to let you win. I am not going to take it anymore. You are ruining my fucking life and you MUST FUCKING DIE!\u201d Unfortunately, this approach rarely solves the problem. Anxiety doesn\u2019t bend to absolutism. You have to take a subtler, more reasoned approach. But that doesn\u2019t mean anger is totally unhelpful. Being pissed off is a strong cocktail for the will. It stiffens the spine. It strengthens resolve. It makes a person less willing to run away from the anxiety and more willing to walk into it, which you\u2019re going to have to do, ultimately, if you don\u2019t want to end up a complete agoraphobic.

When we disempower ourselves in our mommy selves, we experience this weakness as anxiety. When we desexualize ourselves in our mommy selves, it leads us to feel dead in our skin. All this places an undue burden upon our children. By making them the be-all-and-end-all of our lives, by breaking down the boundaries between ourselves and them so thoroughly, by giving them so much power within the family when they're very small, we risk overwhelming them psychologically and ill-preparing them, socially, for the world of other children and, eventually, other adults.

This was her one free night, and she said it seemed to be helping her. She would breathe in, imagining that she was finding ways to deal with her debts. She would breathe out, telling herself that her money problems would one day be behind her.It went on like this, Tuesday after Tuesday.Finally, one day I looked through her finances with her. I figured out that if she spent four or five months working a part-time job on Tuesday nights, she could actually pay off all the money she owed.I told her I had nothing against yoga or meditation. But I did think its always best to try to treat the disease first. Her symptoms were stress and anxiety.

  "Design is not limited to fancy new gadgets. Our family just bought a new washing machine and dryer. We didn\u2019t have a very good one so we spent a little time looking at them. It turns out that the Americans make washers and dryers all wrong. The Europeans make them much better \u2013 but they take twice as long to do clothes! It turns out that they wash them with about a quarter as much water and your clothes end up with a lot less detergent on them. Most important, they don\u2019t trash your clothes. They use a lot less soap, a lot less water, but they come out much cleaner, much softer, and they last a lot longer. We spent some time in our family talking about what\u2019s the trade-off we want to make. We ended up talking a lot about design, but also about the values of our family. Did we care most about getting our wash done in an hour versus an hour and a half? Or did we care most about our clothes feeling really soft and lasting longer? Did we care about using a quarter of the water? We spent about two weeks talking about this every night at the dinner table. We\u2019d get around to that old washer-dryer discussion. And the talk was about design. We ended up opting for these Miele appliances, made in Germany. They\u2019re too expensive, but that\u2019s just because nobody buys them in this country. They are really wonderfully made and one of the few products we\u2019ve bought over the last few years that we\u2019re all really happy about. These guys really thought the process through.

  "The intentions of the cybernetic totalist tribe are good. They are simply following a path that was blazed in earlier times by well-meaning Freudians and Marxists - and I don't mean that in a pejorative way. I'm thinking of the earliest incarnations of Marxism, for instance, before Stalinism and Maoism killed millions.Movements associated with Freud and Marx both claimed foundations in rationality and the scientific understanding of the world. Both perceived themselves to be at war with the weird, manipulative fantasies of religions. And yet both invented their own fantasies that were just as weird.The same thing is happening again. A self-proclaimed materialist movement that attempts to base itself on science starts to look like a religion rather quickly. It soon presents its own eschatology and its own revelations about what is really going on - portentous events that no one but the initiated can appreciate. The Singularity and the noosphere, the idea that a collective consciousness emerges from all the users on the web, echo Marxist social determinism and Freud's calculus of perversions.

  "To begin with, there is the frightful debauchery of taste that has already been effected by a century of mechanisation. This is almost too obvious and too generally admitted to need pointing out. But as a single instance, take taste in its narrowest sense - the taste for decent food. In the highly mechanical countries, thanks to tinned food, cold storage, synthetic flavouring matters, etc., the palate it almost a dead organ. As you can see by looking at any greengrocer\u2019s shop, what the majority of English people mean by an apple is a lump of highly-coloured cotton wool from America or Australia; they will devour these things, apparently with pleasure, and let the English apples rot under the trees. It is the shiny, standardized, machine-made look of the American apple that appeals to them; the superior taste of the English apple is something they simply do not notice. Or look at the factory-made, foil wrapped cheeses and \u2018blended\u2019 butter in an grocer\u2019s; look at the hideous rows of tins which usurp more and more of the space in any food-shop, even a dairy; look at a sixpenny Swiss roll or a twopenny ice-cream; look at the filthy chemical by-product that people will pour down their throats under the name of beer. Wherever you look you will see some slick machine-made article triumphing over the old-fashioned article that still tastes of something other than sawdust. And what applies to food applies also to furniture, houses, clothes, books, amusements and everything else that makes up our environment. These are now millions of people, and they are increasing every year, to whom the blaring of a radio is not only a more acceptable but a more normal background to their thoughts than the lowing of cattle or the song of birds. The mechanisation of the world could never proceed very far while taste, even the taste-buds of the tongue, remained uncorrupted, because in that case most of the products of the machine would be simply unwanted. In a healthy world there would be no demand for tinned food, aspirins, gramophones, gas-pipe chairs, machine guns, daily newspapers, telephones, motor-cars, etc. etc.; and on the other hand there would be a constant demand for the things the machine cannot produce. But meanwhile the machine is here, and its corrupting effects are almost irresistible. One inveighs against it, but one goes on using it. Even a bare-arse savage, given the change, will learn the vices of civilisation within a few months. Mechanisation leads to the decay of taste, the decay of taste leads to demand for machine-made articles and hence to more mechanisation, and so a vicious circle is established.": "George",

  "But the Turing test cuts both ways. You can't tell if a machine has gotten smarter or if you've just lowered your own standards of intelligence to such a degree that the machine seems smart. If you can have a conversation with a simulated person presented by an AI program, can you tell how far you've let your sense of personhood degrade in order to make the illusion work for you?People degrade themselves in order to make machines seem smart all the time. Before the crash, bankers believed in supposedly intelligent algorithms that could calculate credit risks before making bad loans. We ask teachers to teach to standardized tests so a student will look good to an algorithm. We have repeatedly demonstrated our species' bottomless ability to lower our standards to make information technology look good. Every instance of intelligence in a machine is ambiguous. The same ambiguity that motivated dubious academic AI projects in the past has been repackaged as mass culture today. Did that search engine really know what you want, or are you playing along, lowering your standards to make it seem clever?

When that happens, a commonality of culture is enacted between the storer and the retriever of the bits. Experience is the only process that can de-alienate information.Information of the kind that purportedly wants to be free is nothing but a shadow of our own minds, and wants nothing on its own. It will not suffer if it doesn't get what it wants.But if you want to make the transition from the old religion, where you hope God will give you an afterlife, to the new religion, where you hope to become immortal by getting uploaded into a computer, then you have to believe information is real and alive.

  "Some people believe labor-saving technological change is bad for the workers because it throws them out of work. This is the Luddite fallacy, one of the silliest ideas to ever come along in the long tradition of silly ideas in economics. Seeing why it's silly is a good way to illustrate further Solow's logic.The original Luddites were hosiery and lace workers in Nottingham, England, in 1811. They smashed knitting machines that embodied new labor-saving technology as a protest against unemployment (theirs), publicizing their actions in circulars mysteriously signed \"King Ludd.\" Smashing machines was understandable protection of self-interest for the hosiery workers. They had skills specific to the old technology and knew their skills would not be worth much with the new technology. English government officials, after careful study, addressed the Luddites' concern by hanging fourteen of them in January 1813.The intellectual silliness came later, when some thinkers generalized the Luddites' plight into the Luddite fallacy: that an economy-wide technical breakthrough enabling production of the same amount of goods with fewer workers will result in an economy with - fewer workers. Somehow it never occurs to believers in Luddism that there's another alternative: produce more goods with the same number of workers. Labor-saving technology is another term for output-per-worker-increasing technology. All of the incentives of a market economy point toward increasing investment and output rather than decreasing employment; otherwise some extremely dumb factory owners are foregoing profit opportunities. With more output for the same number of workers, there is more income for each worker.Of course, there could very well be some unemployment of workers who know only the old technology - like the original Luddites - and this unemployment will be excruciating to its victims. But workers as a whole are better off with more powerful output-producing technology available to them. Luddites confuse the shift of employment from old to new technologies with an overall decline in employment. The former happens; the latter doesn't. Economies experiencing technical progress, like Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, do not show any long-run trend toward increasing unemployment; they do show a long-run trend toward increasing income per worker.Solow's logic had made clear that labor-saving technical advance was the only way that output per worker could keep increasing in the long run. The neo-Luddites, with unintentional irony, denigrate the only way that workers' incomes can keep increasing in the long-run: labor-saving technological progress.The Luddite fallacy is very much alive today. Just check out such a respectable document as the annual Human Development Report of the United Nations Development Program. The 1996 Human Development Report frets about \"jobless growth\" in many countries. The authors say \"jobless growth\" happens whenever the rate of employment growth is not as high as the rate of output growth, which leads to \"very low incomes\" for millions of workers. The 1993 Human Development Report expressed the same concern about this \"problem\" of jobless growth, which was especially severe in developing countries between 1960 and 1973: \"GDP growth rates were fairly high, but employment growth rates were less than half this.\" Similarly, a study of Vietnam in 2000 lamented the slow growth of manufacturing employment relative to manufacturing output. The authors of all these reports forget that having GDP rise faster than employment is called growth of income per worker, which happens to be the only way that workers \"very low incomes\" can increase.": "William",

  "When scientists underestimate complexity, they fall prey to the perils of unintended consequences. The parables of such scientific overreach are well-known: foreign animals, introduced to control pests, become pests in their own right; the raising of smokestacks, meant to alleviate urban pollution, releases particulate effluents higher in the air and exacerbates pollution; stimulating blood formation, meant to prevent heart attacks, thickens the blood and results in an increased risk of blood clots in the heart. But when nonscientists overestimate [italicized, sic] complexity- 'No one can possibly crack this [italicized, sic] code\" - they fall into the trap of unanticipated consequences. In the early 1950s , a common trope among some biologists was that the genetic code would be so context dependent- so utterly determined by a particular cell in a particular organism and so horribly convoluted- that deciphering it would be impossible. The truth turned out to be quite the opposite: just one molecule carries the code, and just one code pervades the biological world. If we know the code, we can intentionally alter it in organisms, and ultimately in humans. Similarly, in the 1960s, many doubted that gene-cloning technologies could so easily shuttle genes between species. by 1980, making a mammalian protein in a bacterial cell, or a bacterial protein in a mammalian cell, was not just feasible, it was in Berg's words, rather \"ridiculously simple.\" Species were specious. \"Being natural\" was often \"just a pose.": "Siddhartha",

  "To measure market needs, I would watch carefully what customers do, not simply listen to what they say. Watching how customers actually use a product provides much more reliable information than can be gleaned from a verbal interview or a focus group. Thus, observations indicate that auto users today require a minimum cruising range (that is, the distance that can be driven without refueling) of about 125 to 150 miles; most electric vehicles only offer a minimum cruising range of 50 to 80 miles. Similarly, drivers seem to require cars that accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour in less than 10 seconds (necessary primarily to merge safely into highspeed traffic from freeway entrance ramps); most electric vehicles take nearly 20 seconds to get there. And, finally, buyers in the mainstream market demand a wide array of options, but it would be impossible for electric vehicle manufacturers to offer a similar variety within the small initial unit volumes that will characterize that business. According to almost any definition of functionality used for the vertical axis of our proposed chart, the electric vehicle will be deficient compared to a gasolinepowered car.This information is not sufficient to characterize electric vehicles as disruptive, however. They will only be disruptive if we find that they are also on a trajectory of improvement that might someday make them competitive in parts of the mainstream market. The trajectories of performance improvement demanded in the market\u2014whether measured in terms of required acceleration, cruising range, or top cruising speed\u2014are relatively flat. This is because traffic laws impose a limit on the usefulness of ever-more-powerful cars, and demographic, economic, and geographic considerations limit the increase in commuting miles for the average driver to less than 1 percent per year. At the same time, the performance of electric vehicles is improving at a faster rate\u2014between 2 and 4 percent per year\u2014suggesting that sustaining technological advances might indeed carry electric vehicles from their position today, where they cannot compete in mainstream markets, to a position in the future where they might.": "Clayton",

  "The Pirates' most advanced and widely discussed technological innovation is an online system called LiquidFeedback, which allows the party to better understand what its members think about issues of the day. Here is how it works: Any member of the party can register (with the optino of using a pseudonym) with LiquidFeedback and propose that the Pirates should do x. If more than 10 percent of other members find this proposal intriguing, it passes to the next stage, in which party members can vote for or against it.After the proposal has been submitted, and before it has moved to the voting stage, other party members can launch counterproposals on a similar subject or make suggestions about how to improve the original one. What's interesting is that party members can transfer their votes to those they consider more knowledgeable about a given subject; thus, someone recognized as an expert on transportation policy might end up casting ten votes rather than one. To prevent some such experts from accumulating and abusing power, transferred votes can be recalled to their original \"ownders.\" The votes cast in LiquidFeedback are not bniding; they simply inform party officials about the views of the grass roots. Big policy proposals are still discussed and voted upon at the party congress. LiquidFeedback thus aims to provide the intellectual inputs to the Pirates' work; the outputs are still determined by rather conventional means.This all sounds great in theory...but the reality is much grimmer. In one German region, reports Der Spiegel, the Pirates used LiquidFeedback to gather general opinions on only two issues, while only twenty votes were cast in the controversial law on circumcision.": "Evgeny",

  "Conceive a world-society developed materially far beyond the wildest dreams of America. Unlimited power, derived partly from the artificial disintegration of atoms, partly from the actual annihilation of matter through the union of electrons and protons to form radiation, completely abolished the whole grotesque burden of drudgery which hitherto had seemed the inescapable price of civilization, nay of life itself. The vast economic routine of the world-community was carried on by the mere touching of appropriate buttons. Transport, mining, manufacture, and even agriculture were performed in this manner. And indeed in most cases the systematic co-ordination of these activities was itself the work of self-regulating machinery. Thus, not only was there no longer need for any human beings to spend their lives in unskilled monotonous labour, but further, much that earlier races would have regarded as highly skilled though stereotyped work, was now carried on by machinery. Only the pioneering of industry, the endless exhilarating research, invention, design and reorganization, which is incurred by an ever-changing society, still engaged the minds of men and women. And though this work was of course immense, it could not occupy the whole attention of a great world-community. Thus very much of the energy of the race was free to occupy itself with other no less difficult and exacting matters, or to seek recreation in its many admirable sports and arts. Materially every individual was a multi-millionaire, in that he had at his beck and call a great diversity of powerful mechanisms; but also he was a penniless friar, for he had no vestige of economic control over any other human being. He could fly through the upper air to the ends of the earth in an hour, or hang idle among the clouds all day long. His flying machine was no cumbersome aeroplane, but either a wingless aerial boat, or a mere suit of overalls in which he could disport himself with the freedom of a bird. Not only in the air, but in the sea also, he was free. He could stroll about the ocean bed, or gambol with the deep-sea fishes. And for habitation he could make his home, as he willed, either in a shack in the wilderness or in one of the great pylons which dwarfed the architecture even of the American age. He could possess this huge palace in loneliness and fill it with his possessions, to be automatically cared for without human service; or he could join with others and create a hive of social life. All these amenities he took for granted as the savage takes for granted the air which he breathes. And because they were as universally available as air, no one craved them in excess, and no one grudged another the use of them.": "Olaf",

  "There is no doubt that 'force multipliers' - squad automatic weapons - have changed the character of warfare once again, just as their predecessors did during the First World War, if perhaps not to quite the same degree. In the immediate future it seems that most armies will be using some form of 5.56mm machine-gun at squad level, be it a box-fed LSW or belt-fed SAW. If there is a cloud on the horizon where modern light machine-guns are concerned it is that they are not powerful enough for long-range work, or for penetrating cover and light armour. Nevertheless, the new generation of light machine-guns will remain in use well into the next century, not least because they are popular with the soldiers who operate them, the machine-gunners. Likewise, there will still be a place for the heavier GPMG, which does have the 'punch' that the LSW lacks.Machine-guns themselves have become lighter, and their operating principles both more secure and more efficient; the ammunition they use has shrunk to a quarter of its original size and become almost 100 percent reliable. The one important thing which has not changed dramatically is the human component; the attitude with which man faces the prospect of death in battle, and how he prepares himself to face that possibility quite deliberately, for it was the original invention of the machine-gun which reformed that. More than any other single 'advance' in weapons technology, the machine-gun allowed an individual (or actually, a small team of men) to dominate a sector of the battlefield. They had an inhuman advantage which simply had to be exploited if they were to be on the winning side, whether their opponents were Zulus, Sioux, or Dervishes, or other industrialized nations to be beaten into last place in the race toward economic supremacy. Whether the machine-gun has been as important, in any sense at all of the word, as it near-contemporary, the internal combustion engine - or even, date one say it, the bicycle or sewing machine - is still to be decided, but there is one clear, irrefutable fact connected with its short history: it has killed tens of millions of men, women and children and blighted the lives of tens of millions more.": "Roger",

Those involved in decisions about new military technologies for the U.S. Army and Air Force simply do not appear to have had access to good intelligence about the Soviet military technological developments. How, then, were decisions made as to technologies to develop?Military research and development decisions are made amid great uncertainties. In an ideal world, such decisions would be managed by estimating the future costs of alternative programs and their prospective military values, and then pursuing the program with the best ratio of cost to value. But...there are tremendous difficulties in forecasting the real value and costs of weapons development programs. These uncertainties, combined with the empirical difficulty American technology managers had in collecting intelligence on the Soviet Union, meant that research and development strategies in the real world tended to become strategies for managing uncertainties. At least two such strategies are conceivable. One of the most politically important can be called, for want of a better phrase, \"let the scientists choose.\" [This approach should be] compared with the theoretical and practical arguments for a strategy that concentrates on low-cot hedges against various forms of uncertainty.": "Stephen",

  "Here we introduce the nation's first great communications monopolist, whose reign provides history's first lesson in the power and peril of concentrated control over the flow of information. Western Union's man was one Rutherford B. Hates, an obscure Ohio politician described by a contemporary journalist as \"a third rate nonentity.\" But the firm and its partner newswire, the Associated Press, wanted Hayes in office, for several reasons. Hayes was a close friend of William Henry Smith, a former politician who was now the key political operator at the Associated Press. More generally, since the Civil War, the Republican Party and the telegraph industry had enjoyed a special relationship, in part because much of what were eventually Western Union's lines were built by the Union Army.So making Hayes president was the goal, but how was the telegram in Reid's hand key to achieving it?The media and communications industries are regularly accused of trying to influence politics, but what went on in the 1870s was of a wholly different order from anything we could imagine today. At the time, Western Union was the exclusive owner of the nationwide telegraph network, and the sizable Associated Press was the unique source for \"instant\" national or European news. (It's later competitor, the United Press, which would be founded on the U.S. Post Office's new telegraph lines, did not yet exist.) The Associated Press took advantage of its economies of scale to produce millions of lines of copy a year and, apart from local news, its product was the mainstay of many American newspapers.With the common law notion of \"common carriage\" deemed inapplicable, and the latter day concept of \"net neutrality\" not yet imagined, Western Union carried Associated Press reports exclusively. Working closely with the Republican Party and avowedly Republican papers like The New York Times (the ideal of an unbiased press would not be established for some time, and the minting of the Time's liberal bona fides would take longer still), they did what they could to throw the election to Hayes. It was easy: the AP ran story after story about what an honest man Hayes was, what a good governor he had been, or just whatever he happened to be doing that day. It omitted any scandals related to Hayes, and it declined to run positive stories about his rivals (James Blaine in the primary, Samuel Tilden in the general). But beyond routine favoritism, late that Election Day Western Union offered the Hayes campaign a secret weapon that would come to light only much later.Hayes, far from being the front-runner, had gained the Republican nomination only on the seventh ballot. But as the polls closed his persistence appeared a waste of time, for Tilden, the Democrat, held a clear advantage in the popular vote (by a margin of over 250,000) and seemed headed for victory according to most early returns; by some accounts Hayes privately conceded defeat. But late that night, Reid, the New York Times editor, alerted the Republican Party that the Democrats, despite extensive intimidation of Republican supporters, remained unsure of their victory in the South. The GOP sent some telegrams of its own to the Republican governors in the South with special instructions for manipulating state electoral commissions. As a result the Hayes campaign abruptly claimed victory, resulting in an electoral dispute that would make Bush v. Gore seem a garden party. After a few brutal months, the Democrats relented, allowing Hayes the presidency \u2014 in exchange, most historians believe, for the removal of federal troops from the South, effectively ending Reconstruction.The full history of the 1876 election is complex, and the power of th": "Timothy",

Now imagine you wished to increase the pleasure you were feeling, feel it more intensely. What might you do? Well one of the things you'd probably do is close your eyes. What this does of course is shut out other stimuli. The visual quiet increases your sensual enjoyment and you concentrate more fully on the pleasure. The same is true for the removal of auditory noise as well. Well my feeling is that the average person has a much harder time doing this today than they would have decades ago. Today you close your eyes and shut off Television but the noise persists. It's part of our fabric now, our biology, and all other pleasures including sex are diminished as a result.

I take his chin and kiss his lips, hard. I'm reminded, all of a sudden, of that first day on the beach, when I pulled his head from the water. \"For luck,\" I say to his startled face.": "Maggie",
  "Earthquakes just happen. Tornadoes just happen. Your tongue does not just happen to fall into some other girls mouth!": "Gemma",
  "Well, it's either kiss me or kill me, that's how I see it.": "Tom",
  "Then come here,\" he said, a bit redundantly, as he had already pulled her with him into an armchair and curled her up in his arms. \"Tell me what I can do to help you feel be": "Kristin",
  "Magnus reached for Alec, but instead of rising to his feet, he pulled Alec against him, his hand sliding up Alec\u2019s back to knot in his hair. Magnus pulled Alec down and against him, and kissed him,hard and awkward and determined, and Alec froze for a moment and then abandoned himself to it, to kissing Magnus, something he\u2019d thought he\u2019d never get to do again. Alec ran his hands up Magnus\u2019sshoulders to the sides of his neck and cupped his hands there, holding Magnus in place while he kissed him thoroughly breathless.": "Cassandra",
  "I touch her cheek to slow the kiss down, holding her mouth on mine so I can feel every place where our lips touch and every place where they pull away. I savor the air we share in the second afterwards and the slip of her nose across mine. I think of something to say, but it is too intimate, so I swallow it. A moment later I decide I don't care. \"I wish we were alone,\" I say as I back out of the cell. She smiles. \"I almost always wish that.": "Veronica",
  "Teasing's part of the fun that comes before kissing": "Lois",
  "One day, Liesel.' he said, 'you'll be dying to kiss me.": "Markus",
  "Now a soft kiss - Aye, by that kiss, I vow an endless bliss.": "John",
  "It was the best first kiss in the history of first kisses. It was as sweet as sugar. And it was warm, as warm as pie. The whole world opened up and I fell inside. I don't know where I was, but I didn't care. I didn't care because the only person who mattered was there with me.": "Sarah",
  "He kisses me like he's giving me every kiss he wishes he could have given me the past, and every kiss he'll wish he could give me in the future.All at once.": "Colleen",
  "They meet in the girls' bathroom. The last time they were forced to meet in a place like this, they took separate, isolated stalls. Now they share one. They hold each other in the tight space, making no excuses for it. There's no time left in their lives for games, or for awkwardness, or for pretending they don't care about each others, and so they kiss as if they've done it forever. As if it is as crucial as the need for oxygen.": "Neal",
  "Then he kissed her. At his lips' touch she blossomed for him like a flower and the incarnation was complete.": "F.",
  "Her fingertips reached to trace the damage, but he grasped her hand with his own. He leaned down, far enough that the dark ends of his hair brushed feather-light against her face, caught in her lashes.": "Kelly",
  "It was exactly as he\u2019d thought it would be, like the first time and the millionth time all at once, like being wide awake, like losing his balance. Only this time, it wasn\u2019t just him; this time, they were losing their balance together.": "Jennifer",
  "What was a kiss without a kiss?\" It was a tablecloth tugged from beneath a party service, everything jumbled against everything else in just a few chaotic moments. Fingers in hair. Hands cupping necks. Mouths dragged on cheeks and chins in dangerous proximity.": "Maggie",
  "Shut up and kiss me, Duchess.\u201d\u201cMax!\u201d\u201cAll right, I\u2019ll kiss you.": "Kristen",
  "I'm going to kiss you now, and I don't know if I'll ever stop.": "Jamie",
  "Kiss me until I forget how terrified I am of everything wrong with my life.": "Beau",
  "You should be kissed and by someone who knows how.": "Margaret",
  "One day you may kiss a man you can\u2019t breathe without, and find breath is of little consequence.\u201d\u201cRight, and one day my prince might come.\u201d\u201cI doubt he\u2019ll be a prince, Ms. Lane. Men rarely are.": "Karen",
  "The kiss itself is immortal. It travels from lip to lip, century to century, from age to age. Men and women garner these kisses, offer them to others and then die in turn.": "Guy",
  "Cole sat back up, slowly, and I opened my eyes. His expression, as ever, was blank, the face he wore when something mattered. He said, \"That's how I would kiss you, if I loved you.": "Maggie",
  "Impulsively, I lean forward and kiss him, stopping his word. This is probably overdue anyway since he\u2019s right, we are supposed to be madly in love.": "Suzanne",
  "Try it again,\" I said. \"Kiss me.\"\"No,\" he said.\"Kis": "Benjamin",
  "Besides, if one little kiss makes her a slut, I'd hate to know what that makes you.": "Kelly",
  "She could not bear to look at him just now. If she did, she might well slap him again. Or cry. Or kiss him. And never know which was right and which was wrong and which was madness.": "George",
  "A sunset is the sun\u2019s fiery kiss to the night.": "Crystal",
  "It\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve ever kissed a boy, which should make some sort of impression I guess, but all I can register is how unnaturally hot his lips are from the fever.": "Suzanne",
  "I should\u2019ve been very cross with Anubis. Kissing me without permission\u2014the nerve!": "Rick",
  "She is so lovely she could kill you without you even noticing it. A monster girl who knows when to kiss and when to kill.": "Cameron",
  "What are you doing?\"\"What I've wanted to do for a long time.\"She couldn't move, couldn't think. She was lost in his dark eyes, and as he slowly lowered his head toward hers, she whispered, \"Are you going to throttle me, then?\"He was laughing when he kissed her.": "Julie",
  "What you should really be sorry for,\" he continued, \"is that for the rest of my life, I'll have to avoid wine cellars to keep from thinking about you.\"\"Why? Was kissing me that bad?\"A devil-solf whisper. \"No sweetheart. It was that good.": "Lisa",
  "Don't you want me to kiss you goodbye, sweetie?\"\"Kiss a cow farm boy": "Nora",
  "I'll stay away from you and you'll stay away from me. I'm already over this insignificant, puny, inconsequential attraction. I don't even remember kissing you.\"They had reached the cluster of trees in front of the courtyard leading to Frances Catherine's cottage when she told him that outrageous lie.\"The hell you have forgotten,\" he muttered. He grabbed hold of her shoulders and forced her to turn around. Then he took hold of her chin and pushed her face up.\"What do you think you're doing?\" she demanded.\"Reminding you.": "Julie",
  "I want to touch with my mouth. His mouth, with my mouth. Maybe his neck, too. But first things first: Make him aware I exist.It\u2019s possible that he is already aware, if only in a \u2018don't step on the small girl\u2019 kind of way.": "Laini",
  "And yes, when he kisses you, the rest of the world disappears and your brain shuts off and all you can feel are his lips and nothing else matters.": "Jess",
  "I guess it\u2019s time.\u201dWhile Cress\u2019s thoughts continued to churn through the horrible things that could happen to her, she felt herself being suddenly spun around and dipped backward, a supportive arm scooping beneath her back. She yelped and caught herself on Thorne\u2019s shoulder.Then he was kissing her.": "Marissa",
  "We kissed for aboutthe thousandth time,No promises,no demands,Just solid rebuildingof shattered trust.": "Ellen",
  "I wished it was raining,\" he said.\"I don't need the rain,\" I said. \"I need you.": "Benjamin",
  "Suddenly, I was just sure he was going to kiss me. He was there, I could feel his breath, the ground solid beneath us. But then something crossed his face, a thought, a hesitation, and he shifted slightly. Not now. Not yet. It was something I'd done so often - weighing what I could afford to risk, right at that moment - that I recognized it instantly. It was like looking in a mirror.": "Sarah",
  "She turned suddenly, and before I could react, framed my face with her hands and pressed her lips to mine.I froze, mostly in shock, but after a moment my body uncoiled and I closed my eyes, relaxing into her. I remembered this; the feel of her lips on mine,cool and soft, the touch of her fingers on my skin. I remembered her scent, those long nights when we would lie under the cold, frozen stars,dreaming in each other\u2019s arms.For a second, my body reacted instinctively. I started to pull us closer, to wrap my arms around her and return the kiss with equal passion\u2026but, thenI stopped.I remembered this perfectly; every shining moment with Ariella was forever etched into my mind. What we\u2019d had, what we\u2019d shared, everything. I\u2019dbuilt a shrine to her in my memories, carefully tended with grief and anger and regret. I knew every inch of our relationship, the passion, the feelingof emptiness when we weren\u2019t together, the longing and, yes, the love. I had been in love with Ariella. I remembered what she\u2019d meant to me once,what I\u2019d felt for her then\u2026\u2026and what I didn\u2019t feel for her now.": "Julie",
  "Can I try something?\" I said. \"If you dont' like it, I'll stop.": "Aimee",
  "There was no time for kissing but she wanted him to know that in the future there would be. A kiss in so much loneliness was like a hand pulling you up out of the water, scooping you up from a place of drowning and into the reckless abundance of air. A kiss, another kiss.": "Ann",
  "I wanted more of those sweltering kisses. I felt terrible about that. But the warm sunny fragrance of him...he smelled better than any human being I'd ever met. \"Okay\" I said unsteadily, \"forget what I said about not exchanging names. Who are you?\"\"For you, honey...I'm trouble.\" -Haven & Hardy": "Lisa",
  "Kiss me\"\u201cYou\u2019re a fucking nightmare.\u201d\u201cKiss me.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re ruining my life.\u201d\u201cKiss me, Jethro. Kiss me.": "Pepper",
  "O Mistress mine, where are you roaming?O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,That can sing both high and low:Trip no further, pretty sweeting;Journeys end in lovers meeting,Every wise man's son doth know.What is love? 'Tis not hereafter;Present mirth hath present laughter;What's to come is still unsure:In delay there lies not plenty;Then, come kiss me, sweet and twenty,Youth's a stuff will not endure.": "William",
  "A kiss, when all is told, what is it? An oath taken a little closer, a promise more exact. A wish that longs to be confirmed, a rosy circle drawn around the verb 'to love'. A kiss is a secret which takes the lips for the ear, a moment of infinity humming like a bee, a communion tasting of flowers, a way of breathing in a little of the heart and tasting a little of the soul with the edge of the lips!": "Edmond",
  "Believe this,\" he whispered, and kissed her with the sharp, sleek kiss, the silver kiss, so swift and true, and razor sharp, and her warmth was flowing into him.": "Annette",
  "How she felt when he kissed her- like a tub of roses swimming in honey, cologne, nutmeg and blackberries.": "Samuel",
  "I won\u2019t touch you,\u201d I assured him, knowing I could throw a burst of energy that would undoubtedly drop the curtain on the moment. \u201cI have it under control.\u201dHe traced the line of my clavicle with this finger and kissed the corners of my mouth. \u201cNot even if I ask? I want your fingerprints all over me like a crime scene.": "Dannika",
  "When you meet someoneso different from yourself,in a good way,you don\u2019t even have to kissto have fireworks go off.": "Lisa",
  "Of course one kiss changes things. If it's done right, a kiss changes everything.": "Tessa",
  "See the mountains kiss high HeavenAnd the waves clasp one another;No sister-flower would be forgivenIf it disdained its brother;And the sunlight clasps the earth,And the moonbeams kiss the sea -What is all this sweet work worthIf thou kiss not me? ": "Percy",
  "If you wanted to play with fire, milady, you could have simply asked me for a kiss or three.": "Lisa",
  "It was at first almost as if he hadn't wanted to kiss her. His mouth was hard on hers, unyielding; then he put both arms around her and pulled her against him. His lips softened. She could feel the rapid beat of his heart, taste the sweetness of apples still on his mouth. She wound her hands into his hair, as she'd wanted to do since the first time she'd seen him. His hair curled around her fingers, silky and fine. Her heart was hammering, and there was a rushing sound in her ears, like beating wings": "Cassandra",
  "I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t do more. But happy birthday, Sadie.\u201d He leaned forward and kissed me on the lips.": "Rick",
  "I\u2019ve been kissed by men who did a very good job. But they don\u2019t give kissing their whole attention. They can\u2019t. No matter how hard they try parts of their minds are on something else. Missing the last bus\u2014or their chances of making the gal\u2014or their own techniques in kissing\u2014or maybe worry about jobs, or money, or will husband or papa or the neighbors catch on. Mike doesn\u2019t have technique . . . but when Mike kisses you he isn\u2019t doing anything else. You\u2019re his whole universe . . . and the moment is eternal because he doesn\u2019t have any plans and isn\u2019t going anywhere. Just kissing you.": "Robert",
  "As I kissed her the heat of her body increased, and it exhaled a wild, untamed fragrance.": "Gabriel",
  "He nodded and leaned down to kiss me. I let him, Dad be damned.": "S.C.",
  "And when it comes, her kiss is like something not so much felt as found.": "Libba",
  "Just a kiss on your lips in the moonlight just a touch in the fire burning so bright no I don't wanna mess this thing up I don't wanna push too far just a shot in the dark that you just might be the one I've been waiting for my whole life but baby I'm alright with just a kiss goodnight": "Lady",
  "As to my mouth, of all my features, I wish I could possess my mouth again, just as it had been before the fire. I had my mother\u2019s lips, generous below and above; and what kissing I had practiced, mainly on my hand or on a lonely pig, had convinced me that my lips would be the source of my good fortune. I would kiss with them, and lie with them, I would make victims and willing slaves of anyone my eyes desired, simply by talking a little, and following the talk with kisses, and the kisses with demands. And they\u2019d melt into compliance, everyone of them, happy to perform the most demeaning acts as long as I was there to reward them with a long, tongue-tied kiss when they were done. But the fire didn\u2019t spare my lips; it took them too, erasing them utterly.": "Clive",
  "He put the box in Kahlan's lap. As she picked it up, she gave him the biggest smile he had ever seen. Before he even knew what he had done, he had leaned over and given Kahlan a quick kiss. Her eyes went wide, and she didn't kiss him back, but the feel of her lips shocked him into realizing what he had done.Oh. Sorry,\" he said.She laughed. \"Forgiven.": "Terry",
  "I cupped her chin and tilted it back, deepening the kiss, wanting to somehow claim her very soul. Funny thing was, it was my soul that was being claimed, my breath that was being stolen, and my heart that was pounding crazy fast in my chest.": "Jennifer",
  "For one entire day I let his kiss burn on my cheek and into my blood and I don't push the memory away... This kiss, these words, they feel like beginning.": "Ally",
  "It seems that I have been held in some dreaming stateA tourist in the waking world world, never quite awake.No kiss, no gentle word could wake me from this slumber,Until I realised that it was you who held me under.": "Florence",
  "It seared her senses; it made her feel alive, even as it sucked that life away - and she kept coming back to it, again and again. Waves of sensation pulled her under - drowning her. But Blue made drowning feel like the loveliest thing. Like she was losing her breath, but she didn't need it, didn't want it, only wanted him.": "Sarah",
  "It's like this,\" Nana says. \"All your life you're yellow. Then one day you brush up against something blue, the barest touch, and voila, the rest of your life you're green.": "Tess",
  "What's wrong?\" His voice was loud, so sharp that he sounded angry.I knew I should be careful, keep the secret, but I was too far gone to talk around it. My chest was working in huge spasms and I could barely breathe. \"I kissed her.\"\"And then you went into anaphylactic shock?\"I closed my eyes and let the rain patter against my face through the open window \"She has her tongue pierced.": "Brenna",
  "You know what they say about mistakes though,' she said, all breathy and half-lipsy. 'It's the only way you ever learn anything.' And she leant forward and kissed him. Right there, in the middle of the bar. Right there, in the middle of his lips.": "Gabrielle",
  "And then, just at that moment, when I'm no longer sure if I'm dreaming or awake or walking some valley in between where everything you wish for comes true, I feel the flutter of his lips on mine, but it's too late, I'm slipping, I'm gone, he's gone, and the moment curls away and back on itself like a flower folding up for the night.": "Lauren",
  "I want to give you back your first kiss, the one that jerk stole fromyou. And I want it to be something that even a coma can't make youforget.": "Shelly",
  "You sound worked up. Really worked up. No, that's not it. You sound agitated...flustered...aroused.\" I could feel her eyes widen. \"He kissed you, didn't he?\"No answer.\"He did! I knew it! I've seen the way he looks at you. I knew this was coming. I saw it from a mile away.\"I didn't want to think about it.\"What was it like?\" Vee pressed. \"A peach kiss? A plum kiss? Or an al-fal-fa kiss?\"\"What?\"\"Was it a peck, did mouths part, or was there tongue? Never mind. You don't have to answer that. Patch isn't the kind of guy to deal with preliminaries. There was tongue involved. Guaranteed.": "Becca",
  "If a kiss could be seen I think it would look like a violet,' said Priscilla.Anne glowed.'I'm so glad you spoke that thought, Priscilla, instead of just thinking it and keeping it to yourself. This world would be a much more interesting place\u2026although it is very interesting, anyhow\u2026if people spoke out their real thoughts.": "L.M.",
  "If he'd been any other boy, and this was any other world, I would have kissed him. Nothing could have stopped me.": "Sarah",
  "Joie,\" he said with his lips hovering over mine. \"What?\" I felt my heart flutter. \"Shut up,\" he muttered and then he kissed me.": "Leah",
  "So that\u2019s our approach. Very simple, and we\u2019re really shooting for Museum of Modern Art quality. The way we\u2019re running the company, the product design, the advertising, it all comes down to this: Let\u2019s make it simple.

  "I kiss [her] even though I know that if you kiss a girl before you are married to her you might get AIDS.": "Josh",
  "When their lips met, and their tongues touched, it was like they were kissing in a hundred different places, and her senses were flooded with new sensations and old memoires. He kissed her, and their souls melted into each other in a melody older than time.": "Melissa",
  "I got a question for you, gonna come over here and kiss me with those pretty lips?": "Agatha",
  "All Mattia saw was a shadow moving toward him. He instinctively closed his eyes and then felt Alice\u2019s hot mouth on his, her tears on his cheek, or maybe they weren\u2019t hers, and finally her hands, so light, holding his head still and catching all his thoughts and imprisoning them there, in the space that no longer existed between them.": "Paolo",
  "You\u2019d kiss me back right now if I kissed you,\u201d he said, and I tried to decide whether to even attempt denial. \u201cBut then you\u2019d remember him and you\u2019d feel bad for it.": "Heather",
  "There was something behind the softness that intertwined our fingers together\u2014love? It felt different from two days ago. All I could think about was his smooth hand, wrapped in mine. It was more than affection\u2014but I wasn\u2019t sure how much more, or if that would ever change.": "Alysha",
  "Talon thought kissing Flit to shut him up might be a good idea. He was wrong. It was a fucking great idea.": "Agatha",
  "At the first kiss I felt something melt inside me that hurt in an exquisite way. All my longings, all my dreams and sweet anguish, All the secrets that slept deep within me came awake, Everything was transformed and enchanted, everything made sense.": "Hermann",
  "It was the kiss of a man who had waited years for the moment, and feared that it would never come again.": "Jana",
  "In its own way the kiss had been an act of murder.": "Jeff",
  "You can't be just a scribe, or a wizard. Nameless God,\" he cried, raking a hand through his hair. \"I wish they had never found you, never made you think you were the princess. Nothing else, will ever be good enough, not now. You'll never be happy. You'll throw yourself into danger, take it all on yourself, just to prove that they were all wrong about you. And I just-I just-\"And without warning, he stepped on front of me, grabbed my shoulders to stop my pacing, and kissed me.": "Eilis",
  "And so, from the first, we separated our pleasure. She lay on the rug and I lay at right angles to her so that only our lips might meet. Kissing in this way is the strangest of distractions. The greedy body that clamors for satisfaction is forced to content itself with a single sensation and, just as the blind hear more acutely and the deaf can feel the grass grow, so the mouth becomes the focus of love and all things pass through it and are re-defined. It is a sweet and precise torture.": "Jeanette",
  "Lord Ironman, please play tonsil hockey with me, just this one time. There, does that make you happy?": "Mercy",
  "A kiss can be dreadfully terrifying for the males of our species, I'm afraid.\" Rose said knowingly. \"Sex is easy. All they really need is a few good thrusts. But when they kiss, they open themselves up and let you in. And that, my dear, makes some men's balls shrink to the size of raisins.\"Shelley snorted with laughter.Dex strode up to her. \"Did someone say raisins? I'm starving.\"\"You might try asking Max for some,\" Shelley said. \"I'm sure he has at least two.": "Samantha",
  "We're lucky.\" He slipped his hand around her waist and splayed it in the small of her back. \"Most couples have only one first kiss. We'll have two.": "Christina",
  "I sure would like to get kissed.How would that feel on my mouth,How different would I be after,a changed climate down in my insides?": "Virginia",
  "The sound of a kiss is not as strong as that of a cannon, but its echo endures much longer.": "Richard",
  "He pauses for only a fraction of a second. Then he leans forward and presses his lips to mine, and the whole world powers off, the moon and the rain and the sky and the streets, and it\u2019s just the two of us in the dark, alive, alive, alive.": "Lauren",
  "REVISITING THE LIST1. Kiss EstelleOkay, at least I've met her. She thinks I'm a creep. And that's withought her knowing I've read her diaries.

  "You can kiss me if you like,\" she said.Alex let go of her and turned away. \"Thanks, Fiona,\" he said. \"But frankly I'd prefer to kiss the horse.": "Anthony",

  "A kiss can be like the world turning over. It can be like the tide of a dragon's dream washing through the unseen world that is hidden to mortal eyes but that nevertheless permeates our being. It can be hot and cold together, as vast as the heavens and yet specific to the pressure of hands and the parting of lips. It raised more intense feelings than I had expected, like being engulfed in a storm of lightning.": "Kate",
  "How did it happen that their lips came together? How does it happen that birds sing, that snow melts, that the rose unfolds, that the dawn whitens behind the stark shapes of trees on the quivering summit of the hill? A kiss, and all was said.": "Victor",
  "I hate couples sitting together for hours and waiting for each other to kiss.": "M.F.",
  "And okay, fine. If you have to kiss her, you have to kiss her. And believe me, I do not envy you. That's taking one for the team a little far. I mean, I think I'd rather endure the stabbing myself instead of having to kiss her.": "Gena",
  "Now it's not just my lip you'll be needing to kiss if you're wishing to make amends with me, Irish.": "Karen",
  "Out in Saxe-Coburg Street she stood still for a moment and looked at the gardens. He kissed me, she thought. He made the move; I didn't. The thought was an overwhelming one and invested the everyday world about her, the world of the square, of trees, of people walking by, with a curious glow, a chiaroscuro which made everything precious. It was the feeling, she imagined, that one had when one vouchsafed a vision. Everything is changed, becomes more blessed, making the humblest of surroundings a holy place.": "Alexander",
  "Don't kiss me\", he said, looking into Natalie's eyes. There was a second's silence. \"Let me kiss you. I'm old-fashioned that way.": "Rowan",
  "Dan smiled at me with lips still moist from mine. I have seen clouds part for the sun. I have seen rainbows. I have seen flowers in the morning, covered in dew, and I have seen sunsets so brilliant with fire they have made me want to weep.And I have seen Dan smile at me, his lips still wet from my kiss, and if I had to choose which sight moved me the most I would say it was that one.": "Megan",

  "It's okay, we can go back from this.\" It comes out of his mouth so kind - he means it - and it just makes me feel worse. That he can kiss me like this and change everything, but still promise me nothing has to change because I can't promise him anything.": "Courtney",
  "What will you do if I kiss you right now?\"\"I'll kiss you back.\"\"In what way? Sweet, soft, and slow like a first kiss? Or passionately and rude until I make you breathless?\"\"Just do it on your own style.\"\"Bad then. I've never kissed any woman before.": "Yuli",
  "My whole body sank forward into his arms. His lips moved against mine, exploring my mouth so gently. I tried to mimic his movements--slowly, uncertainly, until I didn't have to think about it at all. It just felt right. He let out a soft moan at my reaction and cupped his hands behind my head, pulling me closer until I couldn't tell where my mouth ended and his began. A liquid sensation swooped throughout my stomach. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever felt and it kept growing, the vibrating heat expanding outward. I was surprised I was still able to stand.": "Heather",

  "It's hard to say goodbye for good at any time or any place. It's harder still to say it through a meshed wire. It crisscrossed his face into little diagonals, gave me only little broken-up molecules of it at a time. It stenciled a cold, rigid frame around every kiss.": "Cornell",
  "I saw the sunset-colored sands, The Nile like flowing fire between, Where Rameses stares forth serene, And Ammon's heavy temple stands.I saw the rocks where long ago, Above the sea that cries and breaks, Swift Perseus with Medusa's snakes Set free the maiden white like snow.And many skies have covered me, And many winds have blown me forth, And I have loved the green, bright north, And I have loved the cold, sweet sea.But what to me are north and south, And what the lure of many lands, Since you have leaned to catch my hands And lay a kiss upon my mouth.": "Sara",

  "He cupped his hand around her cheek, and she marveled at how perfectly his palm fit her cheek. His fingers in her hair, she waited, maybe for an eternity, for his lips to meet hers. When they did it was like being inside an exploding star. Time and space became irrelevant. She slipped her arms under his, clinging to him, his body the only thing stopping her from drifting away, untethered in space. His hand on her back slipped under layers of clothes, finding her skin. He pulled her close, and she leaned into him, feeling like she could never be close enough to him.": "Summer",
  "It's shocking, isn't it, that a kiss could have led to something so big and violent and full of light as a human being? It makes me dizzy to think of all the things that start that way.

  "I kissed the girl on the lips, as if to suck her breath inside me. When I did this, the girl wilted, ever so slightly. In my arms, gradually she became lighter, and more transparent. The smell of lilies rose up, filling my breast, overwhelming me. The taste of the kiss was so sweet, I couldn't stop\u2013even thoughI knew she would go on wilting if I continued. The girl was wilting by the instant, and something thick and strong was filling my breast.": "Hiromi",
  "She sank her teeth into his bottom lip, drawing blood, and gave a wicked laugh, and still he kissed her. Not out of desperation or hope or for luck, but simply because he wanted to. Saints, he wanted to. He kissed her until the cold night fell away and his whole body sang with heat. He kissed her until the fire burned up the panic and the anger and the weight in his chest, until he could breathe again, and until they were both breathless.": "V.E.",
  "Cash leaned forward against her hand and Harper met him halfway. The kiss was powerful and demanding. Harper wrapped her arms around Cash, feeling his heartbeat against her chest.

  "the intimacy of the kiss, that feeling of euphoria that comes with that kiss that is right and real, that kiss that swallows you up, starting from the curl in your toes to the fine hairs on the back of your neck, that kiss that leaves you panting for air, that makes each part of your body quiver as you melt against him, that makes you suck his bottom lip into your mouth with the overwhelming urge to bite it.

  "Farragut's first visitor was his wife. He was raking leaves in yard Y when the PA said that 734-508-32 had a visitor. He jogged up the road past the firehouse and into the tunnel. It was four flights up to cellblock F. \"Visitor,\" he said to Walton, who let him into his cell. He kept his white shirt prepared for visits. It was dusty. He washed his face and combed his hair with water. \"Don't take nuttin but a handkerchief,\" said the guard. \"I know, I know, I know....\" Down he went to the door of the visitor's room, where he was frisked. Through the glass he saw that his visitor was Marcia.There were no bars in the visitor's room, but the glass windows were chicken-wired and open only at the top. A skinny cat couldn't get in or out, but the sounds of the prison moved in freely on the breeze. She would, he knew, have passed three sets of bars - clang, clang, clang - and waited in an anteroom where there were pews or benches, soft-drink engines and a display of the convict's art with prices stuck in the frames. None of the cons could paint, but you could always count on some wet-brain to buy a vase of roses or a marine sunset if he had been told that the artist was a lifer. There were no pictures on the walls of the visitor's room but there were four signs that said: NO SMOKING, NO WRITING, NO EXCHANGE OF OBJECTS, VISITORS ARE ALLOWED ONE KISS.": "John",

Well, Louisa, that\u2019s worth a kiss, isn\u2019t it?\u2019\u2018You can take one, Mr. Bounderby,\u2019 returned Louisa, when she had coldly paused, and slowly walked across the room, and p. 18ungraciously raised her cheek towards him, with her face turned away.\u2018Always my pet; ain\u2019t you, Louisa?\u2019 said Mr. Bounderby. \u2018Good-bye, Louisa!\u2019He went his way, but she stood on the same spot, rubbing the cheek he had kissed, with her handkerchief, until it was burning red. She was still doing this, five minutes afterwards.\u2018What are you about, Loo?\u2019 her brother sulkily remonstrated. \u2018You\u2019ll rub a hole in your face.\u2019\u2018You may cut the piece out with your penknife if you like, Tom.

  "I will if you give me a little kiss.\u201d Furi grinned. He was tipsy and horny now. Tequila does that to a man.\u201cGet the fuck outta here.\u201d Doug laughed and pulled on Furi\u2019s hair. \u201cJust because you have long, soft hair and I\u2019ve had a little to drink, doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m gonna mistake you for a woman.\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t want you too. Come on. One little kiss,\u201d Furi moaned.\u201cFine. But only because I feel sorry for you. Make it quick.\u201d Doug laughed.Furi\u2019s head was still resting on Doug\u2019s broad shoulder when he brought his hand up and put it around Doug\u2019s neck to pull him to him. Doug\u2019s smile faded and he looked very serious, Furi thought he was getting mad, but that wasn\u2019t the case at all. Doug closed the distance and pressed his soft lips to Furi's. Both of them gasped in surprise at the initial contact. There was no tongue wrestling or groping. Just his friend giving him a little comfort and some much needed affection. Furi hadn\u2019t been with anyone since he left his husband last year. That\u2019s a long time to go without any sexual contact or the comforting touch of a lover. Furi felt Doug\u2019s strong hand thread through his hair, making him lean back into the touch. His eyes fell closed when he felt Doug place a soft kiss against his throat. But what Doug did next brought tears to Furi\u2019s eyes. Doug wrapped him in his muscled arms and hugged him tight, whispering on the shell of his ear that he\u2019d be okay, that he\u2019d protect him no matter what. It was exactly what Furi needed.": "A.E.",

I only need, like, five of them.\u201d\u201cOh my God,\u201d I laughed, shoving at his shoulders. \u201cYou\u2019re terrible.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m not terrible.\u201d His eyes met mine, and the flutter was back, deeper and more dizzying. \u201cI\u2019m in love.\u201dOh, gosh.

  "I reached up to touch his mask. It was so cold, despite how flushed his skin was just beyond it. My hand shook, and my breathing became shallow as I grazed the skin of his jaw. It was smooth\u2014and hot.He wet his lips, his breathing as uneven as my own. His fingers contracted against the plane of my lower back, and I let him tug me closer to him\u2014until our bodies were touching, and the warmth of him seeped into me.I had to tilt my head back to see his face. His mouth was caught somewhere between a smile and a wince.\u201cWhat?\u201d I asked, and put a hand on his chest, preparing to shove myself back. But his other hand slipped under my hair, resting at the base of my neck.\u201cI\u2019m thinking I might kiss you,\u201d he said quietly, intently.\u201cThen do it.\u201d I blushed at my own boldness.But Tamlin only gave that breathy laugh, and leaned in.His lips brushed mine\u2014testing, soft and warm. He pulled back a little. He was still staring at me, and I stared right back as he kissed me again, harder, but nothing like the way he\u2019d kissed my neck. He withdrew more fully this time and watched me.\u201cThat\u2019s it?\u201d I demanded, and he laughed and kissed me fiercely.My hands went around his neck, pulling him closer, crushing myself against him. His hands roved my back, playing in my hair, grasping my waist, as if he couldn\u2019t touch enough of me at once.": "Sarah",
  "Before I could protest, which wouldn\u2019t be wise even though I did want him to hang out longer, he placed his hands on my cheeks. My breath stalled out somewhere between my throat and chest. Leaning in, he pressed his lips against my forehead, dropping a kiss that squeezed my heart into slush. My eyes drifted shut as his lips lingered against my skin. Knocked off-kilter, I didn\u2019t move when he pulled back and stood.": "Jennifer",

  "Sam was stiff and tired. He crept onto the houseboat, careful not to wake anyone, and sidled down the narrow passage to his bunk. The shades were drawn and of course there were no lights, so he felt his way to the edge of his bed and crawled across it on hands and knees to find his pillow.He collapsed on his back.But even at the edge of sleep he was aware of something different about the bed.Then he felt soft breath on his cheek.He turned and her lips were on his. Not gentle. Not soft. She kissed him hard, and it was like he\u2019d been awakened by an electric power line.She kissed him and slid on top of him.Their bodies did the rest.At some point in the hours that followed he said, \u201cAstrid?\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t you think you should have made sure of that about three times ago?\u201d Astrid said in her familiar, slightly condescending tone.They said many things to each other after that, but nothing that involved words.": "Michael",
  "Claire tipped her head back, and this time he found her lips. It was, she thought, supposed to be a fast and sweet little kiss, but somehow it slowed down, got warmer and deeper. His lips were damp and soft as silk, and that was such a contrast to the hard lines of his body pressed against her. The strength of his hands sliding around her waist and pulling her even closer. She heard him growl low in his throat, a wild and hungry sound that made her go weak and faint.He broke the kiss and leaned against her, breathing hard. \"Good morning to you too. Man, I just can't stay mad when you do that.\"\"Do what?\" she asked innocently. She didn't feel innocent. She also didn't feel sixteen-nearly-seventeen, not at all. Shane always made her feel older. Much older. Ready for anything. It was a good thing Shane wasn't as dumb as her hormones seemed to be.\"Unless you want to stay home and cut class, we don't really have time to talk about it,\" he said, and waggled his eyebrows. \"So. Wanna cut class and make out?": "Rachel",
  "She felt as wild and free as a little kid, running up the steps with Shane in hot pursuit, and when he grabbed her around the waist and spun her around into his room and kicked the door shut, she squealed in delight. And wiggled to fit herself against his warm, hard body as she kissed him again, breathless and flying.He kissed like their lives depended on it. Like it was an Olympic event and he intended to earn a medal. Somewhere in the back of her head she was chattering to herself, warning that this was going to go too far, that she was just making things worse for both of them, but she couldn't help it. Before long they were stretched out together on Shane's bed, and his big, warm hands were teasing under the hem of her shirt, stroking the fluttering skin of her stomach and stealing her breath. She lost it all when he spread his fingers out, pressing his palm flat against her, and she felt an almost irresistible impulse to feel those hands all over. Everywhere. Her heart was hammering hard enough to make her dizzy, and it was all just so ...Perfect.": "Rachel",
  "Claire started to follow, but Shane's grip on her arm had tightened, and he was holding her back.\"What?\" she asked, and turned to face him. God, he looked amazing. He needed to let Eve dress him all the time.\"Before we go in,\" he said, and bent and kissed her. Claire distantly heard the whistles and catcalls of the shot drinkers -- distantly, because the kiss was sweet and hot and wild, and there was something crazy in it that made her just quiver i": "Rachel",
  "Dropping his arm from my shoulders, he reached down and folded his hand around mine. It wasn\u2019t the first time he\u2019d held my hand, but there was an intimacy there that hadn\u2019t been present before. A tight shiver curled its way down my spine as his thumb moved along my palm while we walked down to class.He had not done that before.Rider let go of my hand when we entered speech, and I stepped in front of him, walking toward my seat. I dropped my bag on the floor and started to sit when Rider swooped down, kissing my cheek once more.I flushed as I glanced over at him.He grinned as he sat. \u201cCouldn\u2019t help myself. Your cheek looked like it was missing my kiss.": "Jennifer",
  "Rider made this sound in the back of his throat. It was deep and masculine, part groan and growl, and it made me shiver. He folded one hand along my cheek and lowered his head to mine, but he didn\u2019t kiss me.No.His warm breath glided over my forehead as his hand slid across my cheek, his fingers spreading into my hair at the base. His other hand landed low on my back, and the weight did insane things to my insides. He drew it up my back, leaving a trail of fire in its wake. My eyes fluttered shut as his lips brushed over the curve of my cheek. It was the craziest torture. My entire body tensed, prepared for the moment when his lips met mine.And it was the sweetest pressure, a feather-light brush of his lips over mine. Once. Then twice. I felt the touch everywhere, a jolt to the system that zipped through my veins, and then the pressure increased.Rider kissed me then.It was a real one, soft and beautiful, and when the kiss deepened, it wasn\u2019t a shy one. He knew what he was doing, and even though I didn\u2019t, an innate knowledge told me it didn\u2019t matter. His lips mapped out mine, and my insides were in tight coils.Kissing was awesome. Amazing. Astonishing. I could probably think of a couple of more words to describe it. Kissing blew me away, and when he lifted his mouth, both of us were breathing hard. He rested his forehead against mine. Neither of us spoke for several moments.I still wasn\u2019t thinking. I had no idea how my hands had gotten to Rider\u2019s chest, but his heart pounded under my palm as fast as mine did. My mind was blissfully blank as I breathed in his scent, a mix of his citrusy cologne and the faint trace of paint.\u201cDid you like that?\u201d he asked, dragging his fingers out of my hair and over the line of my jaw.Screaming yes, oh, God, yes, would\u2019ve probably been a little too excessive, so I managed a somewhat subdued, \u201cYes.\u201dAs Rider grinned, his lips brushed mine. \u201cGood. Because I really liked it.": "Jennifer",

  "He lays me on the bed. I say, right before he kisses me again, \u201cIf you kiss me again, I\u2019m going to knee you in the balls.\u201dHis hands are incredibly soft, like a cloud touching me.\u201cI won\u2019t let you just\u2026\u201d He searches for the right word. \u201c\u2026fly away from me, Cassie Sullivan.\u201dHe blows out the candle beside the bed.I feel his kiss more intensely now, in the darkness of the room where his sister died. In the quiet of the house where his family died. In the stillness of the world where the life we knew before the Arrival died. He tastes my tears before I can feel them. Where there would be tears, his kiss.\u201cI didn\u2019t save you,\u201d he whispers, lips tickling my eyelashes. \u201cYou saved me.\u201dHe repeats it over and over, until we fall asleep pressed against each other, his voice in my ear, my tears in his mouth.\u201cYou saved me.": "Rick",
  "Every gift comes with a price.\u201d I frowned, and he grinned. \u201cA kiss.\u201d\u201cAbsolutely not!\u201d But my blood raced, and I had to clench my hands in the grass to keep from touching him. \u201cDon\u2019t you think it puts me at a disadvantage to not be able to see all this?\u201d\u201cI\u2019m one of the High Fae\u2014we don\u2019t give anything without gaining something from it.\u201dTo my own surprise, I said, \u201cFine.\u201dHe blinked, probably expecting me to have fought a little harder. I hid my smile and sat up so that I faced him, our knees touching as we knelt in the grass.\u201cWhat about your part of the bargain?\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201dHe leaned closer, his smile turning wicked. \u201cWhat about my kiss?\u201dI grabbed his fingers. \u201cHere,\u201d I said, and slammed my mouth against the back of his hand. \u201cThere\u2019s your kiss.": "Sarah",
  "I raise my face to his, ready for the crush of his lips against mine, wanting to share more than these nervous breaths.": "Sarah",
  "Aren\u2019t you coming with us?\u201dI feel his hand on my cheek. I know what this means and I slap his hand away.\u201cYou\u2019re coming with us, Evan,\u201d I say.\u201cThere\u2019s something I have to do.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d My hand flails for his in the dark. I find it and pull hard. \u201cYou have to come with us.\u201d\u201cI\u2019ll find you, Cassie. Don\u2019t I always find you? I\u2014\u201d\u201cDon\u2019t, Evan. You don\u2019t know you\u2019ll be able to find me.\u201d\u201cCassie.\u201d I don\u2019t like the way he says my name. His voice is too soft, too sad, too much like a good-bye voice. \u201cI was wrong when I said I was both and neither. I can\u2019t be; I know that now. I have to choose.\u201d\u201cWait a minute,\u201d Ben says. \u201cCassie, this guy is one of them?\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d I answer. \u201cWe\u2019ll go over it later.\u201d I grab Evan\u2019s hand in both of mine and press it against my chest. \u201cDon\u2019t leave me aga": "Rick",
  "I needed something to distract me-anything far away from my parents\u2019 drama-just for a second. And when I saw my chance I didn\u2019t stop to think about how much I\u2019d regret it later. An opportunity sat on the bar stool beside me, and I lunged at it. Literally.I kissed Wesley Rush.One second his hand lay on my shoulder, and his gray eyes rested, for once, on my face, and the next my mouth was on his. My lips were fierce with bottled emotion, and he seemed to tense, his body frozen in shock. That didn\u2019t last very long. An instant later, he returned the aggression, his hands flying to my sides and pulling me toward him. It felt like a battle between our mouths. My hands clawed into his curly hair, tugging it way harder than necessary, and his fingertips dug into my waist.It worked better than punching someone would have. Not only did it help me release the agonizing pressure, but it definitely distracted me. I mean, it\u2019s hard to think about your dad when you\u2019re making out with somebody.And as disturbing as it sounds, Wesley was a really good kisser. He leaned into me, and I tugged at him so hard that he nearly fell off his bar stool. In that moment, we just couldn\u2019t get close enough to each other. Our separate seats seemed like they were miles apart.All of my thoughts vanished, and I became a sort of physical being. Emotions disappeared. Nothing existed but our bodies, and our warring lips were at the center of everything. It was bliss! It was amazing not to think.Nothing! Nothing\u2026 until he screwed it up.": "Kody",
  "Happy birthday,\u201d he whispered, his breath landing warm and suddenly close to my lips, making my insides flip. And just as quickly as he\u2019d surprised me with the cake, he kissed me, one frosting-covered hand moving from my hair to the back of my neck, the other solid and warm in the small of my back, pressing us together, my chest against his ribs, my hip bones just below his, the tops of our bare summer legs hot and touching. I stopped breathing. My eyes were closed and his mouth tasted like marzipan flowers and clove cigarettes, and in ten seconds the whole of my life was wrapped up in that one kiss, that one wish, that one secret that would forever divide my life into two parts. Up, down. Happy, sad. Shock, awe. Before, after. In that single moment, Matt, formerly known as friend, became something else entirely. I kissed him back. I forgot time. I forgot my feet. I forgot the people outside, waiting for us to rejoin the party. I forgot what happens when friends cross into this space. And if my lungs didn\u2019t fill and my heart didn\u2019t beat and my blood didn\u2019t pump without my intervention, I would have forgotten about them, too. I could have stayed like that all night, standing in front of the sink, Matt\u2019s black apple hair brushing my cheeks, heart thumping, lucky and forgetful\u2026": "Sarah",
  "And what if you weren\u2019t a jinni? What if you were free from their rules?\u201dI stare at him. His jaw tightens, his eyes steely with determination that frightens me to my core. A cloud drifts across the face of the crescent moon, and the courtyard darkens. Here and there, the grass is still bent where Aladdin and I danced just hours earlier. I drop my gaze and glare at it, shaking from head to toe.\u201cDon\u2019t say it, Aladdin. Don\u2019t you even think it.\u201d Dread rises in me like a storm cloud, dark and menacing.Aladdin moves closer. He takes my hands. His skin is warm and crackling with energy, setting me on fire.\u201cI have one wish left,\u201d he murmurs. \u201cAnd this one is for you.\u201d\u201cNo, Aladdin! Don\u2019t speak it. Don\u2019t make the Forbidden Wish. The cost\u2014\u201d\u201cDamn the cost. Zahra, I wish\u2014\u201dI stop him with a kiss.Because it is the first thing I think of to stop the terrible words. Because he fills me with light and hope and deep, deep fear. Because I have been longing to for days.": "Jessica",
  "She threw her arms around him and kissed him. It was a station-platform kiss\u2014spontaneous enough to begin with, but rather inhibited in the follow-through, and with somewhat of a forehead-bumping aspect.": "J.D.",
  "He reached over and took Taylor\u2019s hand. She did not pull her hand away.He moved his hand up her arm. She stiffened a little and glanced around, making sure they weren\u2019t seen. Or, maybe, hoping they were.His hand reached her neck. He leaned toward her and pulled her to him.He kissed her.She kissed him back.He kissed her harder. And she slid her hand under his shirt, fingers stroking his bare flesh.Then he pulled away, fast.\u201cSorry, I . . .\u201d He hesitated, his wallowing brain arguing against a body that was suddenly aflame.Sam stood up very suddenly and walked away.Taylor laughed gaily at his back. \u201cCome see me when you get tired of mooning over the ice princess, Sam.": "Michael",
  "I don't know why or when I started falling for you, Alex. But I did. Ever since I almost ran over your motorcycle that first day of school I haven't been able to stop thinking about what it would be like if you and I got together. And that kiss ... God, I swear I never experienced anything like that in my life. It did mean something. If the solar system didn't tilt then, it never will. I know it's crazy because we're so different. And if anything happens between us I don't want people at school to know. Not that you'll agree to have a secret relationship with me, but I at least have to find out if it's possible. I broke up with Colin, who I had a very public relationship with and I'm ready for something private. Private and real. I know I'm babbling like an idiot, but if you don't say something soon or give me a hint of what you're thinking then I'll--\"\"Say it again,\" he says.\"That whole drawn-out speech?\" I remember something about a solar system, but I'm too light-headed to recite the entire thing all over again.He steps closer. \"No. The part about you fallin' for me.\"My eyes cling to his. \"I think about you all the time, Alex. And I really, really want to kiss you again.\"The sides of his mouth turn up.Unable to face him, I look at the ground. \"Don't make fun of me.\" I can take anything but that right abou": "Simone",
  "How was the kiss with Alex?\"\"Nice,\" I say, thinking about how sensual it was. \"Actually, Isabel, it was more than nice. It was fucking incredible.\"Isabel starts laughing, and I laugh right along with her this time.": "Simone",
  "You call that a kiss?\"\"Yep.\"Okay, so I'm in shock the girl put my hand on her creamy cheek. Damn, you'd think I was on drugs by the way my body reacted.She had me totally under her spell a minute ago. Then the pretty witch turned my game around so she was the one with the upper hand.": "Simone",
  "After we've been dancing awhile and need a breather, we walk off the dance floor. I whip out my cell and say, \"Pose for me.\"The first picture I take is of him trying to pose like a cool bad boy. It makes me laugh. I take another one before he can strike a pose this time.\"Let's take one of the both of us,\" he says, pulling me close. I press my cheek against his while he takes my cell and puts it as far away as he can reach, then freezes this perfect moment with a click. After the picture is taken, he pulls me into his arms and kisses me.": "Simone",
  "I follow the path we\u2019ve taken so many times this summer \u2013 across the front, down the street, cut back through a neighbor\u2019s yard, down the stairs to the beach, past the pier, through the campfire labyrinth, up to the deck of the Shack, and straight into Sam\u2019s arms. Without speaking, he kisses me hard on the mouth and I kiss him back, sobbing and crumpling into his chest like a broken puppet.": "Sarah",
  "What I\u2019ve learnt is: buy the damn shoes. Kiss the boy. You can lose a life in indecision, and regret is a waste of an emotion.": "Kate",
  "Kiss me like you want to live.\u2014Lachlain.": "Kresley",
  "And he kissed me . . . slow. Agonizingly, maddeningly, painfully slow.I loved kissing. I also loved what it usually led to, but I was especially loving this part with Leo. The beginning, when everything is new and exciting, and everything in the entire world boils down to sweet feathering lips and quiet sighs. When the stars fade and the earth ceases to turn, its axis forgotten in the wake of things like: which way will you lean and which way will my neck naturally turn, and is it possible that I can actually detect your fingerprints, because my skin seems so alive right now and my nose just brushed yours and the tiny groan that just rumbled from deep in your chest is the most erotic sound imaginable, and gee your hair smells terrific": "Alice",
  "This girl of my dreams, this girl who is more like me than anyone I've ever met, wants to kiss me.I take over control as soon as she tilts her head. Our lips touch for the briefest moment before I lace my fingers in her hair and keep kissing her soft and gentle. I cup her cheek in my palm, feeling her baby-soft skin against my rough fingers. My body urges me to take advantage of the situation, but my brain (the one inside my head) keeps me in check.A satisfied sigh escapes Brittany's mouth, as if she's content to stay in my arms forever.I brush the tip of my tongue against her lips, enticing her to open her mouth. She tentatively meets my tongue with her own. Our mouths and tongues mingle in a slow, erotic dance until the sound of the front door opening makes her jerk": "Simone",
  "Kiss her. Slowly, take your time, there\u2019s no place you\u2019d rather be. Kiss her but not like you\u2019re waiting for something else, like your hands beneath her shirt or her skirt or tangled up in her bra straps. Nothing like that. Kiss her like you\u2019ve forgotten any other mouth that your mouth has ever touched. Kiss her with a curious childish delight. Laugh into her mouth, inhale her sighs. Kiss her until she moans. Kiss her with her face in your hands. Or your hands in her hair. Or pulling her closer at the waist. Kiss her like you want to take her dancing. Like you want to spin her into an open arena and watch her look at you like you\u2019re the brightest thing she\u2019s ever seen. Kiss her like she\u2019s the brightest thing you\u2019ve ever seen. Take your time. Kiss her like the first and only piece of chocolate you\u2019re ever going to taste. Kiss her until she forgets how to count. Kiss her stupid. Kiss her silent. Come away, ask her what 2+2 is and listen to her say your name in answer.": "Azra",
  "A kiss should be personal, not a mandatory public event": "Ika",
  "Maybe it's not the first kisses that are meant to be special. Maybe it's the last ones.": "Kiera",
  "If you truly believe love conquers all try to give a kiss to a rattlesnake..": "Erik",
  "And so this letter endswith no sadness:my feet are firm upon the earth,my hand writes this letter on the road,and in the midst of life I shall bealwaysbeside the friend, facing the enemy,with your name on my mouthand a kiss that neverbroke away from yours.": "Pablo",
  "Is it true?\u201d I ask him.\u201cIs what true?\u201d His eyes are the color of honey. These are the eyes I remember from my dreams.\u201cThat you still love me,\u201d I say, breathless. \u201cI need to know.\u201dAlex nods. He reaches out and touches my face\u2014barely skimming my cheekbone and brushing away a bit of my hair. \u201cIt\u2019s true.\u201d\u201cBut . . . I\u2019ve changed,\u201d I say. \u201cAnd you\u2019ve changed.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s true too,\u201d he says quietly. I look at the scar on his face, stretching from his left eye to his jawline, and something hitches in my chest.\u201cSo what now?\u201d I ask him. The light is too bright; the day feels as though it\u2019s merging into dream.\u201cDo you love me?\u201d Alex asks. And I could cry; I could press my face into his chest and breathe in, and pretend that nothing has changed, that everything will be perfect and whole and healed again.But I can\u2019t. I know I can\u2019t.\u201cI never stopped.\u201d I look away from him. I look at Grace, and the high grass littered with the wounded and the dead. I think of Julian, and his clear blue eyes, his patience and goodness. I think of all the fighting we\u2019ve done, and all the fighting we have yet to do. I take a deep breath. \u201cBut it\u2019s more complicated than that.\u201dAlex reaches out and places his hands on my shoulders. \u201cI\u2019m not going to run away again,\u201d he says.\u201cI don\u2019t want you to,\u201d I tell him.His fingers find my cheek, and I rest for a second against his palm, letting the pain of the past few months flow out of me, letting him turn my head toward his. Then he bends down and kisses me: light and perfect, his lips just barely meeting mine, a kiss that promises renewal.": "Lauren",
  "Vampire Diaries instead of Supernatural?(Bad choice.)": "Madeleine",
  "We kiss for a long time, a good long time. I don\u2019t even notice that it\u2019s cold and I forget to be afraid because that\u2019s just how good a kisser he is. His lips move above my lips. My lips ache for the touch of him, the softness of his skin. We keep kissing. My hands wrap themselves in his hair. His hand presses me close into him, as close as I can be against him, and he is solid, strong, amazing. My hands leave his hair and journey down to the sides of his face, still tingling.\u201cWe should keep going,\u201d he says, voice gruff and husky again. I love when his voice sounds like that, deeper than normal. His lips puff out a little more, too. \u201cYou\u2019re blushing.\u201dI pull my lips in against each other like I\u2019m still trying to taste him. I move my snowshoes off of his snowshoes. It\u2019s tricky.\u201cYou\u2019re a good kisser,\u201d I say.\u201cSo are you.": "Carrie",
  "As they kissed, the valley and the surrounding cliffsspun and toppled upside down. The saturated greens of the grasses, the stark white of the waterfall, and the warm grays of the cliffs merged and streamed past them in ethereal ribbons, like barely blended paint. Then the blinding blue sky bobbed back into place overhead, and the world was open and free, bursting with sublime majesty.": "Megan",
  "Like, when you kiss him, POW, he gets hit by a bear. Totally not your fault. You shouldn't feel bad about that. It's not your bear.": "Maggie",
  "His eyes are so beautiful and dark and they do look like that dog\u2019s\u2014I mean, that wolf\u2019s. They are kind and strong and a little bit something else and I like them. I like them a lot. No, I like them way too much. Something inside me gets a little warmer, edges closer to him.The fire crackles and I jump again, jittery, nervous, but I don\u2019t jump away from Nick. I jump toward him. Nick in the firelight with just a blanket on is a little hard to resist, no matter how crazy he might be. His skin, deep with heat, seems to glisten. His muscles are defined and good but not all steroid bulky. He is so perfect. And beautiful. In a boy way. Not a monster way. Not a wolf way.\u201cAre you going to kiss me?\u201d My words tremble into the air.He smiles but doesn\u2019t answer.\u201cI\u2019ve never kissed a werewolf before. Are were kisses like pixie kisses? Do they do something to you? Is that why you never kissed anybody?\u201dHe gives a little smile. \u201cNo. It\u2019s just I never kissed anyone because I never thought I could be honest about who I am, you know? And I didn\u2019t want anyone to get attached to me because . . .\u201d\u201cBecause you\u2019re a werewolf.\u201d\u201cBecause I\u2019m a werewolf,\u201d he repeats softly. Watching his lips move makes me shiver; not in a scared way, in more of an oh-he-is-too-beautiful way.I put my hand against his skin. It is warm. It\u2019s always been warm. He smells so good, like woods and safety. I swallow my fear and move forward, and my lips meet his, angel-light, a tiny promise. His lips move beneath mine. His hands move to my shoulders and my mouth feels like it will burst with happiness. My whole body shakes with it.\u201cWow,\u201d I say.\u201cYeah,\u201d he says. \u201cWow.\u201dOur mouths meet again. It\u2019s like my lips belong there . . . right there. One tiny part of me has finally found a place to fit.": "Carrie",
  "Oh.\u201d I touch my cheeks. \u201cYou licked me.\u201dHe laughs and leans over, giving a tiny tongue swipe to my hand. \u201cYou\u2019re very lickable.\u201dI try to hit him. He laughs harder and grabs my hands.\u201cNo fair! Mere mortal against werewolf,\u201d I complain.\u201cFine.\u201dHe lets go, but first he kisses my fingers, each of them. I sigh happily.": "Carrie",
  "Do you admit that you are not the only person, or half-person genetically, that can save other sentient beings?\u201dHe crinkles his nose. \u201cI do.\u201d\u201cAnd do you admit that you have a bad temper, a cute car, and a nice girlfriend?\u201dI hold my breath.\u201cI have an amazing girlfriend,\u201d he says. And then he kisses me, which is, you have to admit, the perfect boyfriend thing to do. The kiss is soft and speckling like star promises in a night sky. I stretch into it, wishing that I could hold onto it forever, even though I know that kisses can\u2019t last forever\u2014can they?": "Carrie",
  "Zara.\u201d He sighs. The wind bellows outside. \u201cHow can I make you understand this? I need your mom. If I don\u2019t get her, more boys will die.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d\u201cNo, it\u2019s just how it is.\u201dI think for a second. \u201cIf that\u2019s true, then why did Ian try to turn me?\u201dHe loses his composure. His face shifts into something worried, something almost human. \u201cDid he kiss you?\u201d\u201cAlmost. Betty killed him first.\u201dHe almost smiles. He pulls his hand through his hair. \u201cBetty is fierce.\u201d\u201cIs that why you stay away when she\u2019s here?\u201d\u201cNot even a pixie wants to tangle with a tiger.\u201dHe blows on the ember in his hand. It turns to dust.\u201cYou seem like you could handle almost anything,\u201d I say.\u201cThis?\u201d He smirks. \u201cParlor tricks.": "Carrie",
  "My eyes meet his eyes.\u201cYou were a jerk,\u201d I say.His hands move to my cheeks. \u201cI\u2019m sorry.\u201dI pull away, but I can only go an inch before I bump into lacrosse sticks, not that I really want to go any farther. \u201cNope. No way. You do not get to kiss me yet.\u201dHe pouts.": "Carrie",
  "And do you admit that you have a bad temper, a cute car, and a nice girlfriend?\u201dI hold my breath.\u201cI have an amazing girlfriend,\u201d he says. And then he kisses me, which is, you have to admit, the perfect boyfriend thing to do. The kiss is soft and speckling like star promises in a night sky. I stretch into it, wishing that I could hold onto it forever, even though I know that kisses can\u2019t last forever\u2014can they?": "Carrie",
  "So there\u2019s this annual dance in a couple of weeks.\u201d\u201cThe Winter Ball,\u201d I interrupt. \u201cThere have been signs up everywhere.\u201d\u201cYou want to go?\u201dI think about it for a half second. \u201cWill you dress up?\u201dHe nods.I move forward so my hands are flat on the towel and my face is much closer to his face. Something inside my chest warms up like a nice kind of heartburn and I say, \u201cAnd will we slow dance?\u201dHe nods again. His bottom lip turns in toward his mouth for a second, just disappears and then comes back.Stretching out my spine so my lips are nearly touching his I say, \u201cAnd will you press yourself against me and we\u2019ll move really close together and then your hand will stretch out across the back of my head and your fingers will wrap into my hair and then . . .\u201dHe doesn\u2019t nod. He just tilts his head down, moves his fingers into my hair, and his lips touch mine in a forever kiss. His lips are soft and hard all at once. His breath mixes with my breath. Everything inside of me whooshes out.": "Carrie",
  "...you have me,\u201d Astrid said.\u201cDo I?\u201d\u201cYes.\u201dThat drained the anger and frustration from him like someone had pulled a plug. For a long moment he was lost, gazing into her eyes. She was very close. His heart shifted to a deeper rhythm that vibrated his whole body.There were just inches between them. He closed the distance by half, stopped.\u201cI can\u2019t kiss you with your little brother watching,\u201d he said.Astrid stepped back, took Little Pete by the shoulders, and turned him so he was facing away.\u201cHow about now?": "Michael",
  "I feel something on my chest. Ivy's resting her head on me. In fact, she's pulled herself so close that we're touching everywhere. My heart picks up speed again, but I'm surprisingly calm, seeing her beautiful face close to mine, her eyes closed in an expression of content bliss, and\u2014the best part\u2014feeling her own heart pound in time with mine. She's feeling what I'm feeling.That is when I know for sure.\"Ivy?\" I know what I have to do.\"Mm?\" Her songbird voice is a calm purr.\"I think...no. I really, really like you.\"Like moving through molasses, Ivy raises her head. Her eyes are enormous with bewilderment. But there's no fright, no dislike, no anything that discourages me, With that in mind, I don't hesitate as I move my face and my lips to her lips.Ivy's lips are cool like water but delicate and velvety and smooth like round pebbles. She smells like wildflowers, wet earth, and freshly cut grass, which only makes me want her more. I press my lips harder against hers, and a shiver of delight snakes through me when I feel her press back. Daring myself, I open my mouth. So does she, and the kiss deepens. My hand slides upward to caress her satin cheek, and the back of my neck tingles as her fingers play with my hair.This is it. Ivy's and my first kiss. I wouldn't have it any other way.Unhurriedly we pull our faces away, though we leave our foreheads touching.\"Ivy?\" I peer into her eyes. She doesn't look upset, but more calm and curious.She meets my eyes and asks, \"What was that?\"\"A kiss. You do it with people you like.\"To my amazement Ivy leans forward and kisses me again. It's incredible as the first time.\"That is my feeling towards you,\" she tells me as she leans back. She meets my eyes, her face flushed but determined. \"I...am...really liking you, too.\"I smile and pull her to me, and we grasp each other like we never want to let go.She likes me. I like her.This can't get any better.": "Colleen",
  "Why would I want to watch other people kissing,\" I say, \"when I could be kissing you?": "Becky",
  "And then, without any warning at all, he presses his lips against mine. As his mouth covers my own, I find myself reeling, as if I have been tipped backward and am falling, falling, so that even the stars in the sky are spinning. His lips are warm and soft, the unrelenting pull of his desire for me as strong as the pull of the waves against the sand. It is not like practicing with Ismae, or even Sybella. It is not like any of the first kisses I have imagined over the years. It is far, far better and more wondrous, and yet terrifying as well, like one of the raging storms that pound against the convent walls in the winter, threatening to breach its defenses. So too does this kiss threaten something deep within me that I cannot even name.": "Robin",

He already knows my taste in cosmetics hasn't changed since the seventh grade.\"I like it.\"\"You do?\"\"Well, let me double-check,\" he says, and then he licks his bottom lip before he kisses me again.

And yes, she knew that wasn't a word.She reached his door without either fainting or falling, and counted it as a victory already. And then she raised her hand to knock, but the door whooshed open, and she was pulled inside.\"I was hoping,\" he began, before lowering his mouth onto hers.": "Megan",
  "Because as much as she thought she wanted safety, wanted security and reliability, the kiss had shifted something in her.": "Lindsay",
  "Thanks for driving me home, Mason. And for dinner. And\u2026everything.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re welcome.\u201d His hand cupped my shoulder, his face in the shadows. \u201cWas this a date?\u201d\u201cNo.\u201dHis smile was a slash of white in the darkness. \u201cThen you\u2019re not expecting me to kiss you good-night.\u201d\u201cNo.\u201d I smiled back.\u201cToo bad.": "Elizabeth",

Something I cannot name passes between them, and then Pip\u2019s lips are on Fee\u2019s in a deep kiss, as if they feed on one another, their fingers entwined in each other\u2019s hair. And suddenly, I understand what I must have always known about them\u2014the private talks, the close embraces, the tenderness of their friendship. A blush spreads across my neck at the thought.

  "For his part, Jazz knew he was handsome. It had nothing to do with looking in the mirror, which he rarely did. It had everything to do with the way the girls at school looked at him, the way they became satellites when he walked by, their orbits contorted by his own mysterious gravity. If attention could be measured like the Doppler effect, girls would show a massive blue shift in his presence. In the last year or so, he had even remarked the scrutiny of older women\u2014teachers, cashiers at stores, the woman who delivered UPS packages to his house. What had once been a maternal flavor in their glances had taken on a lingering, cool sort of appraisal. He could almost hear them thinking, Not yet. But soon.Despite his upbringing, despite the infamy of his father, they still watched him. Or maybe because of it. Maybe Howie was right about bad boys.": "Barry",
  "One of his eyes was swollen shut, and his nose was thick and purple. It made her want to cry. And to kiss him. (Because apparently everything made her want to kiss him.

Guys only want one thing, Rach, and it ain\u2019t conversation.

You aren\u2019t seeing anyone.\u201d\u201cAh, hell,\u201d mumbles Jack. \u201cWe\u2019re having the sex talk with my baby sister.\u201d\u201cIs she dating?\u201d Gavin demands of West and Ethan. \u201cShe can\u2019t be dating. Now we have to beat the snot out of some horny teenager. You should have told me this was going on.\u201d\u201cMake them stop,\u201d I whisper to Ethan. Along with the dread of speeches and vomiting, I\u2019m also dying of embarrassment.\u201cShe\u2019s not dating!\u201d West shudders as if spiders cover him. \u201cThat\u2019s just sick, Rach.

Completely lovely. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t we kissing yet?\u201d\u201cThe same question had crossed my mind.\u201d He leaned closer and pressed his lips to mine.I could never get enough of this sweet, crazy kissing.

And the rightness of it, the feeling of longing and belonging, made me want to hold on to it forever.

  "Before I can even ask what he means, he skims his licorice-scented lips across my forehead\u2014just shy of touching\u2014his warm breath dragging across my left eye patch, then down a cheek, toward my mouth. The corner of my mouth tickles as he passes over it; then his breath stops to hover across my chin.His palms rest against the wall on either side of my head. He lets the web serve as his hands, his breath serve as his lips, holding me immobile and kissing me without ever touching me.": "A.G.",

She won\u2019t let me pull away, because she wants to be there again. In Wonderland, where his tobacco-flavored kisses always take us . . .Because the things I loathe are the things she adores: His snark, his infuriating condescension. His menacing mastery of half-truths and riddles. The way he shoves me into the face of danger, forces me to look beyond my fears and reach for my full potential.Most of all, because he encourages me to believe in the madness ...in her . . . the darker side of myself: the queen who was born to reign over the Red kingdom and to give Wonderland a legacy of dreams and imagination.His gloved palms seek the bend of my waist, the bow of my hips. He moves me on top of him, so close there\u2019s not enough space for a blade of grass between us. His kisses grow insistent, desperate. His flavor winds through me, fruit and smoke and earth, and other things born of shadows and storms . . . things I can\u2019t put a name to.": "A.G.",

That is why we didn\u2019t hang out much as we got older. We didn\u2019t drift apart. I pushed you away.": "Shaye",
  "Simon kissed me and I just stood there like someone had cut the cord between my brain and my muscles.Finally, the connection caught and I did kiss him, but awkwardly, some part of me still holding back, my gut twisting, like I was doing something wrong, making a huge mistake, and\u2014Simon stopped. For a moment, he hovered there, face above mine, until I had to look": "Kelley",
  "Their long overdue kiss was interrupted far too soon for either of their likings. \u201cWell, it be about time!\u201d Nothing on God\u2019s earth can douse a man\u2019s ardor like the sound of his mother\u2019s voice.": "Suzan",
  "But before she could speak another word, he crushed his mouth against hers.It was so unexpected that she hadn't the chance to even think of pushing him away. His body pressed her firmly against the rough cave wall. His hands slid down to her waist to pull her closer to him.And just like that, with his proximity, with his kiss, he managed to fill her every sense. He was smoke from the campfire, he was leaves and moss and the night itself.There was nothing gentle in the rebel's kiss, nothing sweet or kind. It was like nothing she'd ever experience before, and so very dangerous\u2014every bit as deadly as the kiss of an arrow.Finally, he pulled back just a little, his dark eyes glazed as if half drunk.\"Princess...\" He cupped her face between his hands, his breath ragged.Her lips felt bruised. \"I suppose that's how Paelsians show their anger and frustration?": "Morgan",

  "I curse him silently for moving my hands as he raises them to study the scars. He kisses them, his lips a fluid brush along sensitive flesh, then places them on his cheeks.Mouth inches from mine, he whispers, \"Forgive me for bringing you into this. There was no other way.\" His skin is softer than clouds must feel, and the tears gathering around my fingertips are hot and tangible. But are they sincere?Our breaths swirl between us, and his black eyes swallow me whole. My heart knocks against the bottom of his rib cage. I know what's coming next. I fear it. But it's the surest way to distract him and get the wish. And if it has to happen, I'm going to be the instigator.Rising up on my toes, I press my mouth to his. He moans, frees my wrists, and sweep-s me into his arms\u2014sealing the teddy bear between us.": "A.G.",
  "It's me I'm losing control of. Hundreds of sketches, and still can't get enough of your face.\" He traces the dimple in my chin with his thumb. \"Your neck.\" His palm moves along my throat. \"Your...\" both hands find my waist and drag me off the table so we're standing toe tote. \"I'm not wasting another second drawing you,\" he whispers against my lips, \"when I can touch you instead.\" He presses his mouth to mine.A spark, hot and electric, jumps between us. Shock and sensation shimmer through me, aglow with his heat ad flavor. Six year of secret desire. Six years of denying that he's the orbit of my world.To think, he's been running from me, too.": "A.G.",

  "I coax my palm into his lapel in search of my wish, returning his feverish kiss. \"Checkmate, you son of a bug,\" I say against his mouth two seconds before my fingers find an empty pocket.\"Sleight of hand, blossom,\" he says right back. \"'Tis in fact in my pants pocket, if you'd like to search there.\"I shove him off and drop to the floor, wiping my mouth. \"It's mine!\"\"And you'll receive it when the time is right.\" His lips, all I can look at, tilt into that smug smile that I've come to detest. He motions toward the chair. \"Sit. You've just been soundly kissed. No doubt you're short of breath.\"\"Don't flatter yourself.\" I huff in an effort to hide the gulp of air and hold the teddy bear against my chest. \"That kiss meant nothing. It had underlying motivation.\"\"Oh, to be sure. That kiss was nothing if not motivational.": "A.G.",
  "Jeb moans, wraps my legs around his waist, and holds me tight. He breaks contact just long enough to whisper, \"Where'd you learn to kiss like that?\"\"You taught me.\" I recover my senses and realize what I said. \"In my dreams.\"\"Oh, yeah?\" He nudges the indentation on my chin with his nose. \"Been dreaming of me, too, huh?\"\"Ever since the day we met.\" Finally, the truth.He flashes his dimples. \"Guess it's time for us to make some dreams come true, skater girl.": "A.G.",

After all, I can't want, nor wish for it, because I'll never get it. Even though there's no way that guy's life will belong to me. Why am I this upset? We met more than ten years ago. But even on the day we first kissed, and the day we first slept together, somehow, he has never... told me he likes me, much less that he loves me. I've never said it either. And yet, I've only told him to stay by my side. I thought that was enough. I hate this. Why am I fixated on that man? I don't want to realise that now. That I want him to love me. I want him to love me. I want him to love me so much I could die.": "Natsuki",

The wings vanished as quickly as they had appeared, and then his lips were crushing into mine. His tongue pried my mouth open, forcing himself into me, into the space where I could still taste Tamlin. I pushed and trashed, but he held firm, his tongue sweeping over the roof of my mouth, against my teeth, claiming me - The door was flung wide, and Amarantha's curved figure filled its space. Tamlin - Tamlin was beside her, his eyes slightly wide, shoulders tight as Rhys's lips still crushed mine.Amarantha laughed, and a mask of stone slammed down on Tamlin's face. void of feeling, void of anything vaguely like the Tamlin I'd been tangled up with moments before.": "Sarah",

We kiss the rings of the self-important. The feet of conquerors. The rich dark earth when we reach the promised land. We kiss our hands and wave as loved ones begin a journey.

Because a kiss should be born from love, and want, and need.

Her tongue teased mine, and everything that had brought us here \u2014 Keirran, Annwyl, the Fade \u2014 rushed out of my head. I'd never felt anything like this before: these crazy, swirling emotions, all centered around the girl in my arms.

My heart turned over, and the air caught in my throat. I pulled back, breathless with the realization. I... was in love.": "Julie",
  "A kiss, he said, is a conversation. Easing closer, he continued to speak as he caressed her cheeks with featherlight stokes of his thumbs. \"A first kiss\", his lips neared hers, is an introduction and then his mouth brushed against hers. The contact sparked, sharp and bright like lightning, yet his lips were soft, unexpectedly so. Her breath caught the same instant his did. Against her mouth he whispered \"That was Hello\" His breath mingled with hers as he waited, his lips so close she could feel their warmth. For a moment she simply breathed him in growing heady on the scent of him and the tight anticipation gathering in her belly. Then she understood. Nerves fluttering, she brushed her lips across his as he had done. Again his breath hitched, as if he too felt that same spark, that hot need. Her eyes drifted closed and his voice poured over her like warm cream. \"This is, 'I'm Jack'.": "Kristen",

I didn't open my eyes for a moment after.\"...oh...,\" she said in a small voice.

  "I turned back to the shrike, but the beak of his mask grazed up my neck and warm lips brushed my ear. Thrills coursed through me, but I didn't move until he started away. I caught his hand. \"Wait.\"He'd felt right. I knew who I needed him to be, even if the way we'd danced was not how- That kind of passion he reserved for music. Not me.A cold breeze made me shiver as I tightened my grip on his. Stepped closer. Searched his eyes. His lips tilted up at one corner, like amusement. I'd known, but still, the familiar expression stunned me so much I almost didn't act.I kissed him.Rather, I pressed my mouth against his and hoped he wouldn't run. It would probably kill me. Three long seconds and he only gasped and tightened his hands on my back. Then, with a soft moan, he opened his mouth and kissed me. It wasn't an easy, sweet kiss like I'd imagined my first would be, but frustraeted and hungry. That was good, better than easy and sweet, because after everything, I was frustrated and hungry for him, too.His beak scraped my cheek, but I ignored it while the tip of his tongue danced over my lips.": "Jodi",
  "I think I finally understand the saying like a moth to a flame. I\u2019m the moth. My heart flutters like the paper thin wings. And he is the flame, incendiary, scorching my soul.He inhales so heavily, like he\u2019s been holding his breath under water. He presses his lips against mine and tugs at my hair gently. My head falls back and my mouth falls open. His tongue, slick as silver, dances with mine.I\u2019m wrong. I\u2019m not a moth. I\u2019m Icarus and I\u2019ve flown too close to the sun.": "A.D.",

  "Two spacemen touching in anti-gravity is like a kiss. But then, there is nothing like a kiss. A kiss is a rare bird. The first sip of champagne. The fleeting glimpse of a shooting star.

  "Like any man, he had no real protection from an unsolicited kiss from a pretty woman, even one he had just murdered.": "Thomm",
  "He leaned forward and bit her bottom lip. It was just the right size. He hated women with thin, judgmental lips. Smeared with dark red lipstick. Stingy and manipulative. Bev\u2019s mouth looked ripe and vulnerable. He sucked on that soft lower lip for a few seconds.": "Penny",
  "Making love requires no thought. You move as the fronds of a palm tree move in the breeze. It is all instinct. All wonder.

There were more skilled kisses, passionate and intentional. There were kisses that stole my breath, kisses that merged seamlessly with the shedding of clothes and the joining of bodies.

  "There is strange, and yet not strange, is the kiss. It is strange because it mixes silliness with tragedy, and yet not strange because there is good reason for it. There is shaking by the hand. That should be enough. Yet a shaking of hands is not enough to give a vent to all kinds of feeling. The hand is too hard and too used to doing all things, with too little feeling and too far from the organs of taste and smell, and far from the brain, and the length of an arm from the heart. To rub a nose like the blacks, that we think is so silly, is better, but there is nothing good to the taste about the nose, only a piece of old bone pushing out of the face, and a nuisance in winter, but a friend before meals and in a garden, indeed. With the eyes we can do nothing, for if we come too near, they go crossed and everything comes twice to the sight without good from one or other.There is nothing to be done with the ear, so back we come to the mouth, and we kiss with the mouth because it is part of the head and of the organs of taste and smell. It is temple of the voice, keeper of breath and its giving out, treasurer of tastes and succulences, and home of the noble tongue. And its portals are firm, yet soft, with a warmth, of a ripeness, unlike the rest of the face, rosy, and in women with a crinkling of red tenderness, to the taste not in compare with the wild strawberry, yet if the taste of kisses went , and strawberries came the year round, half of joy would be gone from the world. There is no wonder to me that we kiss, for when mouth comes to mouth, in all its stillness, breath joins breath, and taste joins taste, warmth is enwarmed, and tongues commune in a soundless language, and those things are said that cannot find a shape, have a name, or know a life in the pitiful faults of speech.": "Richard",

How beautiful you are. You were scared and confused, and I know I wasn\u2019t helping that, but underneath it all you were just beautiful, Haven. You had me the very first time I laid eyes on you. I remember thinking later that morning you were going to complicate my life.\u201d He paused as he laughed to himself. \u201cAnd complicate it you did. Everything I knew, everything I believed\u00a0.\u00a0.\u00a0. all of it went out the window. You turned me upside down and made me feel again.

  "Before she could think, he bent his head and was kissing her, only this wasn't anything like the chaste kiss she'd gave him. His mouth slanted across hers, demanding her response. Soft and warm, his tongue brushed against the tender skin. With a sigh, Clarissa parted her lips and he quickly took advantage, deepening their kiss.His hand cupped the back of her head and his fingers tangled in her hair, while his other arm around her waist locked her against him. Clarissa twined her arms around his neck and felt the cold wall of the house at her back as he pressed her into it.Her pulse raced as their kiss became even more heated, each second that passed marking time they didn't have. Langston's tongue stroked hers in a dance that set fire to her blood. The shadow of whiskers on his face softly abraded her skin. His hair was silky, and she couldn't resist from pushing her fingers into the thick strands, which he must have liked, judging by the masculine groan that met her ears.When he finally lifted his head, both of them were breathing hard.": "Tiffany",

The way I knew it would be, only more. It was real.": "Adam",
  "He kissed her, and something moved between them, an unspoken bond pulling them together over what they had gone through and what they would face.

For one blissful moment they were nothing but feelings and physical sensation. The moment lasted a very long time.": "Mindee",

So I don\u2019t prolong the chat.\u201d\u201cYou might have wanted my kisses more than that. If you had any romance in you you\u2019d have told them you were ready to fight ten legions of angels for my love.\u201dHawk had reached out to hold her. \u201cIf I\u2019d told them that they might have taken me up on it. Angels are not just useful for gallant flourishes the moment you declare your intention to battle all comers for the woman you love. Angels burn like fire and blaze like a hundred suns \u2013 they strike fear in my heart.\u201dShe had pulled away from his embrace and jumped to her feet. \u201cOh, no, you don\u2019t. If I\u2019m not good enough to kiss I\u2019m not good enough to take in your arms either. It\u2019s angels or me. Make up your mind whom you fear more.

His tongue lightly licked the outer edges of my mouth, and then searched for my tongue.

  "I was Juliet and Quinn was Romeo, and the lines weren't dead black-and-white words on a page but somehow alive, as natural and real as the argument we'd had about the spider and the fly. The rows of empty seats were gone, and we were in a candlelit ballrooom, wrapped in our own cocoon of words. But the playful banter of our words couldn't mask what we both knew--that after this, nothing would be the same .And then we got to the kissing part, which we'd only read through together and had never really rehearsed. But it didn't matter, because I was still Juliet and Quinn was still Romeo, his gray-green eyes fixed on mine. And when he bent to kiss me, it was Romeo's lips on Juliet's. Even so, Juliet was just as stunned as I would've been. When I said the last line, I was speaking for both of us. You kiss by the book.": "Jennifer",

I guess we're logistically star-crossed, Juliet.\"Sometimes Quinn calls me Juliet because of how we had to do that scene together, and whenever he does it's good for another bout of brain paralysis. So all I could manage back was \"Oh.\"\"But I'll talk to you later, okay?\" he said.I didn't even try to say anything else but just nodded, wondering as I did what would happen next. The steps had largely emptied by then.But before I could do much wondering, Quinn's lips were on mine.And this time it definitely counted.": "Jennifer",

  "One of the central elements of resilience, Bonanno has found, is perception: Do you conceptualize an event as traumatic, or as an opportunity to learn and grow? \u201cEvents are not traumatic until we experience them as traumatic,\u201d Bonanno told me, in December. \u201cTo call something a \u2018traumatic event\u2019 belies that fact.\u201d He has coined a different term: PTE, or potentially traumatic event, which he argues is more accurate.The theory is straightforward. Every frightening event, no matter how negative it might seem from the sidelines, has the potential to be traumatic or not to the person experiencing it. Take something as terrible as the surprising death of a close friend: you might be sad, but if you can find a way to construe that event as filled with meaning\u2014perhaps it leads to greater awareness of a certain disease, say, or to closer ties with the community\u2014then it may not be seen as a trauma. The experience isn\u2019t inherent in the event; it resides in the event\u2019s psychological construal. It\u2019s for this reason, Bonanno told me, that \u201cstressful\u201d or \u201ctraumatic\u201d events in and of themselves don\u2019t have much predictive power when it comes to life outcomes. \u201cThe prospective epidemiological data shows that exposure to potentially traumatic events does not predict later functioning,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s only predictive if there\u2019s a negative response.\u201d In other words, living through adversity, be it endemic to your environment or an acute negative event, doesn\u2019t guarantee that you\u2019ll suffer going forward.

Dante lived in the thirteenth century, when that balance was achieved by the faith of his age.

For your race, in its poverty, has unquestionably one really effective weapon--laughter. Power, money, persuasion, supplication, persecution-- these can lift at a colossal humbug--push it a little--weaken it a little, century by century; but only laughter can blow it to rags and atoms at a blast.

  "Our visual field, the entire view of what we can see when we look out into the world, is divided into billions of tiny spots or pixels. Each pixel is filled with atoms and molecules that are in vibration. The retinal cells in the back of our eyes detect the movement of those atomic particles. Atoms vibrating at different frequencies emit different wavelengths of energy, and this information is eventually coded as different colors by the visual cortex in the occipital region of our brain. A visual image is built by our brain's ability to package groups of pixels together in the form of edges. Different edges with different orientations - vertical, horizontal and oblique, combine to form complex images. Different groups of cells in our brain add depth, color and motion to what we see.": "Jill",

  "As information processing machines, our ability to process data about the external world begins at the level of sensory perception. Although most of us are rarely aware of it, our sensory receptors are designed to detect information at the energy level. Because everything around us - the air we breathe, even the materials we use to build with, are composed of spinning and vibrating atomic particles, you and I are literally swimming in a turbulent sea of electromagnetic fields. We are part of it. We are enveloped within in, and through our sensory apparatus we experience what is.Each of our sensory systems is made up of a complex cascade of neurons that process the incoming neural code from the level of the receptor to specific areas within the brain. Each group of neurons along the cascade alters or enhances the code, and passes it on to the next set of cells in the system, which further defines and refines the message. By the time the code reaches the outermost portion of our brain, the higher levels of the cerebral cortex, we become conscious of the stimulation. However, if any of the cells along the pathway fail in their ability to function normally, then the final perception is skewed away from normal reality.": "Jill",

If you close your eyes and further imagine you are petting your cat, the same neurons in your brains are activated as if you were petting the actual cat.

  "One noteworthy study suggests that people who suppress negative emotions tend to leak those emotions later in unexpected ways. The psychologist Judith Grob asked people to hide their emotions when she showed them disgusting images. She even had them hold pens in their mouths to prevent them from frowning. She found that this group reported feeling less disgusted by the pictures than did those who'd been allowed to react naturally. Later, however, the people who hid their emotions suffered side effects. Their memory was impaired, and the negative emotions they'd suppressed seemed to color their outlook. When Grob had them fill in the missing letter to the word \"gr_ss\", for example, they were more likely than others to offer \"gross\" rather than \"grass\". \"People who tend to [suppress their negative emotions] regularly,\" concludes Grob, \"might start to see their world in a more negative light.\" p. 223": "Susan",

  "I find that there are a lot of objects and subjects within the world today. There's so much going on, that it seems like reality itself is trying hide something. Not only do we have to deal with illusions that the media, literature, states, governments, religions, and all of the plentiful theatrics of life entrances us with, but we have to deal with reality's false face. People continuously livelife, go to work, play, stress, dance, eat, sleep, and step back into yesterday, not understanding that there are invisible curtains blinding the truth from the surface. Become empty, just for a moment, and ask yourself simple paradoxical questions. Do you know where you are? Do you understand where you are? Do you understand who you are? Do you understand why you are? Gain a sense of glory, by being defeated by your own question, and liberate yourself from the mask that reality has given you since adolescence. However, that is the problem. So many have worn this invisible mask for so long, that they are unable to take it off, and are bound by the illusion that reality wants them to see. Liberation is a goal that you may no longer obtain, but don't worry, for ignorance and deception are your only true friends now. They can carry you to God, but they cannot wake you up.": "Lionel",
  "Still, we permit the appearance of our meats, sauces, fruits, and vdgetables to dominate our tongues until it is difficult to divide a twist of lemon or squeeze of lime from the colors of their rinds or separate yellow from its yolk or chocolate from the quenchless brown which seems to be the root, shoot, stalk, and bloom of it. Yet I hardly think the eggplant's taste is as purple as its skin. In fact, there are few flavors at the violet end, odors either, for the acrid smell of blue smoke is deceiving, as is the tooth of the plum, though there may be just a hint of blue in the higher sauces. Perceptions are always profound, associations deceiving. No watermelon tastes red. Apropos: while waiting for a bus once, I saw open down the arm of a midfat, midlife, freckled woman, suitcase tugging at her hand like a small boy needing to pee, a deep blue crack as wide as any in a Roquefort.
