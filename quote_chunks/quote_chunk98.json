  "I think being funny is not anyone's first choice.": "Woody",
  "Humor has bailed me out of more tight situations than I can think of. If you go with your instincts and keep your humor, creativity follows. With luck, success comes, too.": "Jimmy",
  "Everybody I know who is funny, it's in them. You can teach timing, or some people are able to tell a joke, though I don't like to tell jokes. But I think you have to be born with a sense of humor and a sense of timing.": "Carol",
  "People who know me, they know I have a sense of humor, I'm a bit of a joker, a bit of a clown really, and I would love someone to exploit that side of me and send me a romantic comedy.": "Gary",
  "I am a candid interview and I have a dark and dry sense of humor - a very Canadian sense of humor and I am only learning now stupidly that you can't read tongue. When I say something funny in a newspaper and I meant it to be funny, it doesn't read that way.": "Michael",
  "You have to have a sense of humor about life to get through it.": "Kesha",
  "There's a certain type of character that you can't help but come in contact with growing up and living in Brooklyn and Long Island. A certain mixture of moxie, heart, and a wise guy sense of humor.": "Steve",
  "Absurdity is what I like most in life, and there's humor in struggling in ignorance. If you saw a man repeatedly running into a wall until he was a bloody pulp, after a while it would make you laugh because it becomes absurd.": "David",
  "If one tends to be a humorous person and you have a sense of humor the rest of your life then you can certainly lighten the load, I think, by bringing that to your trials and tribulations. It's easy to have a sense of humor when everything is going well.": "Alan",
  "A book without potty humor is like a banana split without hot fudge. It can still be good, I suppose, but you kinda get the feeling that something is missing.": "Dav",
  "Basically, I think you need two things to get by in this world: a sense of humor and the ability to laugh when your ego is destroyed.": "Arlo",
  "I love dry British humor. I love to sketch in my off time. I love tequila.": "Maren",
  "It has always surprised me how little attention philosophers have paid to humor, since it is a more significant process of mind than reason. Reason can only sort out perceptions, but the humor process is involved in changing them.": "Edward",
  "The President has a wonderful sense of humor, which is one of the reasons it is so much fun to work for him.": "Karen",

  "If the blood humor is too strong and robust, calm it with balance and harmony.": "Xun",
  "Men will confess to treason, murder, arson, false teeth, or a wig. How many of them will own up to a lack of humor?": "Frank",
  "Humor is not a mood but a way of looking at the world. So if it is correct to say that humor was stamped out in Nazi Germany, that does not mean that people were not in good spirits, or anything of that sort, but something much deeper and more important.": "Ludwig",
  "At the risk of appearing disingenuous, I don't really think of myself as 'writing humor.' I'm simply reporting on the world I observe, which is frequently hilarious.": "Richard",

  "I like the brooding man - a brooding man with a sense of humor.": "Maira",
  "My mom taught me the power of love. I learned to focus on the long-term big picture from my father. His sense of humor and light-hearted approach always make me smile. My husband is a pivotal anchor in my life. His influence encourages me to be independent and take risks.": "Padmasree",
  "Wit and playfulness represent a desperately serious transcendence of evil. Humor is both a form of wisdom and a means of survival.": "Tom",
  "As an actor, I'm attracted to drama; as a director, it's humor - because it's the story of my life, and I can't be that serious about it. Being alone is a big theme in all my movies, both as a director and as an actress.": "Jodie",
  "Comedy is difficult for an actor. But I think I have a good sense of humor and manage to make people laugh and make them happy.": "Aishwarya",

  "Humor and laughter - not necessarily derogatory derision - are my pet tools. This may come from my general philosophy of never taking the world too seriously - for fear of dying of boredom.": "Marcel",

  "Ad agencies do all kinds of market research that ask people what they think they want, and instead, you should be creating things that you want. If you do something and you get it, the rest of the world will get it, too. Trust your own instincts, your own intellect, and your own sense of humor.": "George",
  "I'm an off-the-charts introvert. To me, being around groups of strangers is exhausting. I've had to sort of train myself to think about two tactics: finding common ground and invoking humor.": "Sam",
  "Humor is the oxygen of children's literature. There's a lot of competition for children's time, but even kids who hate to read want to read a funny book.": "Sid",
  "What I wrote all the time when I was a kid - I don't want to call it 'poetry,' because it wasn't poetry. I was not that kind of a writer. I was a rhymer. I was a fan of Dorothy Parker's, so maybe I wrote poetry to that extent, but my main focus was the humor of it, and word construction, and the slant. Your words, it's a very powerful experience.": "Carrie",
  "Humor is always based on a modicum of truth. Have you ever heard a joke about a father-in-law?": "Dick",
  "Humor, humility, and, of course, honesty, all are qualities that work in public and cultural diplomacy.": "Cynthia",

  "This is a feminist bookstore. There is no humor section.": "John",
  "Those years on the golf course as a caddie, boy, those people were something. They were vulgar, some were alcoholics, racist, they were very difficult people to deal with. A lot of them didn't have a sense of humor.": "Martin",
  "Humor must not professedly teach and it must not professedly preach, but it must do both if it would live forever.": "Mark",
  "I used to watch 'The Waltons' and sob because my family was nothing like that. We had a cruel sense of humor in my family.": "Paula",
  "I just try to write what I think would really happen, and with grief and tragedy, there are these naturally occurring moments of levity and humor and absurdity. I think that's what life is really like. Sadness gets interrupted, and happiness gets interrupted.": "Kaui",
  "Humor is a powerful tool, and some of these politicians are so far out and easy to lampoon. They just provide such delicious opportunity.": "George",
  "Humor in a relationship is so important. Many women will say that. Some say, 'If they can make you laugh, it's the sexiest thing on earth.'": "Helen",
  "My view of life is colored by humor and looking at the best in any situation.": "Michael",
  "Well, I mean, if a joke or humor is bawdy, it's got to be funny enough to warrant it. You can't just have it bawdy or dirty just for the sake of being that - it's got to be funny.": "Betty",
  "I don't think I would describe my sense of humor. Doesn't sound like the kind of thing I'd do.": "Tommy",
  "Humor is very healing.": "Bonnie",
  "In rough times, pathfinders rely on work, friends, humor and prayer. They develop a support network.": "Gail",
  "If I didn't try to eavesdrop on every bus ride I take or look for the humor when I go for a walk, I would just be depressed all the time.": "Lynda",

  "Newspaper people, once celebrated as founts of ribald humor and uncouth fun, have of late lost all their gaiety, and small wonder.": "Russell",
  "One of my pet peeves is that sometimes the talents of my band get overlooked because, and it was the same problem that Frank Zappa had, with a lot of groups that use humor, people don't realize there's a lot of craft behind the comedy.": "Al",
  "After spending 460 days as a hostage, I did emerge a fundamentally changed person. But I think, like everyone does as they grow older and probably wiser, I can look back at my earlier life - my history, my mistakes, the joy I felt as a young woman traveling the world - with some objectivity and even some humor.": "Amanda",
  "Who I was was not acceptable to black L.A. youth: the way I spoke and my sense of humor. Everybody else had relaxers and pressed hair. I wore my hair in an Afro puff. Nappy. The way I dressed. It was all about name brands at the time in L.A. I had no idea. All those things, I failed miserably at.": "Issa",
  "Humor helps ease the tension of race and the differences in society. If there wasn't comedy I don't know if Obama could have ever become president.": "Marlon",
  "Advertisers also know that humor can help bond us to their product.": "Allen",
  "Today's business and health care climate may not be pleasant. Cutbacks, pay cuts and layoffs do not make anyone's job easy. But that does not mean that the humor need stop.": "Allen",
  "They say you don't want to meet your heroes, but those two guys, you do want to meet them, because they do not disappoint. Walken has this amazing sense of humor, and Pacino is like just a sweetheart of a guy.": "Bill",
  "I think I'm too cynical for L.A. My sense of humor doesn't go down well here, which probably affects my love life. I need to have a laugh track following me around so people know I'm trying to be funny.": "Teddy",
  "I'm a Larry David fan, right? And it seems to me that Jewish history from the Talmud on has been a self-deprecating, self-critical kind of humor.": "Peter",
  "Humor, for me, is really a gate of departure. It's a way of enticing a reader into a poem so that less funny things can take place later. It really is not an end in itself, but a means to an end.": "Billy",
  "I hate to say it but I hate black humor. I feel like a Klan member saying it, but it's just not funny.": "Issa",
  "People of humor are always in some degree people of genius.": "Samuel",
  "It is quite true, as some poets said, that the God who created man must have had a sinister sense of humor, creating him a reasonable being, yet forcing him to take this ridiculous posture, and driving him with blind craving for this ridiculous performance.": "D.",
  "I think kids want the same thing from a book that adults want - a fast-paced story, characters worth caring about, humor, surprises, and mystery. A good book always keeps you asking questions, and makes you keep turning pages so you can find out the answers.": "Rick",
  "Denzel Washington has a great sense of humor. He did all those 'Nutty Professor' movies.": "Seth",
  "Humor is an antidote to all ills.": "Patch",

  "Expand the definition of 'reading' to include non-fiction, humor, graphic novels, magazines, action adventure, and, yes, even websites. It's the pleasure of reading that counts; the focus will naturally broaden. A boy won't read shark books forever.": "Jon",
  "Poor David Hume is dying fast, but with more real cheerfulness and good humor and with more real resignation to the necessary course of things, than any whining Christian ever dyed with pretended resignation to the will of God.": "Adam",

  "Men are happy to be laughed at for their humor, but not for their folly.": "Jonathan",
  "A good actor is someone who knows how to take the part and make it real and make it honest and be effective in it. If it's in a funny movie and, as long as they are cast in an appropriate way, humor will come from it.": "Ivan",
  "You find out in life that people really like you funny. So what do you give 'em? Humor. And then if you show them the other side, they don't like you as much. I find, too, that I can hide behind the idiot's mask being funny, and you never see the sorrow or the pain.": "Terry",
  "We can't understand when we're pregnant, or when our siblings are expecting, how profound it is to have a shared history with a younger generation: blood, genes, humor. It means we were actually here, on Earth, for a time - like the Egyptians with their pyramids, only with children.": "Anne",
  "Humor and seriousness are not in opposition to each other.": "Al",
  "Among my friends, I'm not a little Boy Scout, and they love my humor, thank God.": "Don",

  "There are men so philosophical that they can see humor in their own toothaches. But there has never lived a man so philosophical that he could see the toothache in his own humor.": "H.",

  "My wife has a good sense of humor, and instead of calling me psychic with my novels, she simply refers to me as being 'psycho.' That's because multiple things in my books have come true.": "Brad",

  "Always have a sense of humor about life - you'll need it - but always be courteous to boot.": "Peter",
  "With any character I play, I gravitate to the juxtaposition and humor.": "Shawnee",
  "People ask if I feel pigeon-holed by always doing the same kind of humorous role. But my tool has always been humor because it's the most entertaining way to put any ideology across, and it's fun, and it's positive, and it's a healer. Laughter is God's gift. I feel privileged to be able to do it.": "Goldie",
  "Negative humor is forgotten immediately. It's the stuff that makes us feel better about our lives that lives long. Much more satisfying. Enter children's books.": "Berkeley",
  "Humor can be one of our best survival tools.": "Allen",
  "I believe that economists put decimal points in their forecasts to show they have a sense of humor.": "William",

  "Cynicism is humor in ill health.": "H.",
  "When humor works, it works because it's clarifying what people already feel. It has to come from someplace real.": "Tina",

  "When people are in the midst of really heavy stuff and still have a sense of humor, I admire that.": "Ted",
  "There is nothing like the way people feel after they've seen 'The Intouchables.' They feel amazing. The word of mouth on this film is incredible. It's intelligent-feeling good. You're not insulted by the low-browness or stupidity of some of the humor. It's so smart and terrific.": "Harvey",
  "Anybody with a sense of humor is going to put on my album and laugh from beginning to end.": "Eminem",
  "Using no control and using humor will build a relationship and make a dent to where the client puts the counselor in their quality world and then begins to relate and seek out the counselor. Effective therapy begins with the acceptance of the therapist into the client's quality world.": "William",
  "A sense of humor is good for you. Have you ever heard of a laughing hyena with heart burn?": "Bob",

  "Everybody's got a different sense of humor. It's just different styles.": "Colin",
  "I think Canadian humor is a little less broad than American humor.": "Scott",

  "My parents armed me with an amazing sense of humor, and it's what you need when, well, it's what anyone needs in this world.": "Warwick",
  "The reason why you know more funny dudes than funny chicks is that dudes are funnier than chicks. If my daughter has a mediocre sense of humor, I'm just gonna tell her, 'Be a staff writer for a sitcom. Because they'll have to hire you, they can't really fire you, and you don't have to produce that much. It'll be awesome.'": "Adam",

  "Michael Pollan is a champion. In all ways. A man of great integrity, humor, and common sense and kindness.": "Maira",

  "I think it's important to find humor anywhere you can. In real life, with the darkest, scariest, most intense moments, if you can find something funny, that's good.": "Katie",
  "My humor is channeling everything through my brain. For example, when I talk about something, it's how Richard Lewis feels about it. I'm a storyteller. I do a lot of free association.": "Richard",
  "I like art with a sense of humor. I don't have a huge art education to understand everything. I don't think that means that art has to be watered down to the lowest common denominator, though. I don't think you have to go to college to be able appreciate great art, but I like art that doesn't take itself too seriously.": "Kathleen",

  "Humor is probably the most significant characteristics of the human mind. Far more significant than reason. In fact, reason is actually a very cheap commodity.": "Edward",
  "Humor has to surprise us; otherwise, it isn't funny. It's a death knell for a writer to be labeled a humorist because then it's not a surprise anymore.": "Garrison",
  "There is something really horrific for any human being who feels he is being consumed by other people. I'm talking about a writer's critics, who don't address what you've written, but want to probe into your existence and magnify the trivia of your life without any sense of humor, without any sense of context.": "Wole",
  "Racial humor was about 35% of my act when I first started. But I realized that it was a crutch. What brought it home was when another comedian said to me, 'If you changed color tomorrow, you wouldn't have any material.' He meant it as a put-down, but I took it as a challenge.": "Bill",
  "Ontologically, chocolate raises profoundly disturbing questions: Does not chocolate offer natural revelation of the goodness of the Creator just as chilies disclose a divine sense of humor? Is the human born with an innate longing for chocolate? Does the notion of chocolate preclude the concept of free will?": "David",
  "I'm not 17 anymore. I still have some of the same sort of anger, but I have a sense of humor about it... a sense of being constructive with that anger.": "Dave",
  "I have a really dry sense of humor. I don't think it's funny when people wink at the camera. That's more of an actor thing, just committing to whatever the thing is.": "Topher",
  "Reading 'Youth in Revolt' might have ruined my career because suddenly I wanted to abandon all the emotional truth of something and just go out far on a literary limb with completely implausible things that relied completely on voice and humor. And what saved me is realizing that I couldn't do that very well.": "Rob",
  "The key to humor is often self-loathing or sarcasm. In a sense, that's how self-loathing is made palatable.": "James",

  "If you are a small company taking on a big company, you need to have a sense of humor.": "Richard",
  "I come from a family of teasers myself. My grandfather was from Liverpool, and he had a dry sense of humor, and he would tease us terribly. My brother Beau was so skilled in his teasing that he could get a rise out of me by simply pointing at me.": "Jeff",

  "When humor can be made to alternate with melancholy, one has a success, but when the same things are funny and melancholic at the same time, it's just wonderful.": "Francois",
  "Picking my topics is sort of a process of elimination for me. Most things don't work for me. I like to cover science and unexpected things happening in labs. Also, theoretical research doesn't work for my style. I need scenes and interactions. Then, humor. I'm having the most fun when I can have fun with my work.": "Mary",
  "As fandom grew more variegated, genzines reflected a broadening of interests, carrying personal columns of humor and reflection, science articles, amateur fiction, stylish gossip, and inevitably, thoughtful pieces on the future of fandom.": "Gregory",
  "I've learned to start from a really sound argument, boil down the essence of what you're trying to say, then build your humor around that, rather than starting with, 'This sounds funny,' and going from there.": "Hasan",
  "I love people who have a good sense of humor, tell a good story, tell a good joke.": "Jason",
  "Poop humor is fun. If you do the toilet scenes well and commit to them, they can be really, really powerful.": "Sandra",
  "I grew up on EC comic books and 'Tales From the Crypt,' which were all loaded with humor, bad jokes, and puns.

  "Every time I do a movie like 'Finding Neverland' or 'Chocolat' or 'Shakespeare' in Love,' we deal with the creative process, but there's humor and fun along the way. I always love that kind of movie.": "Harvey",
  "We get the worrywart, the hypochondriac, the money-grubbing miser, the intractable negotiator... Some would say certain of these refer to the stereotypical, or 'stage' Jew. But objectively speaking, the only crime in humor is an unfunny joke.": "Alan",
  "I've never met a person who has more integrity than my husband. I respect that. There's his humor and intelligence, too, and he's really cute, all those things - but if you don't respect your partner, you'll get sick of him.": "Michelle",
  "I consider myself to have a decent sense of humor. What's life without a sense of humor?": "Mayer",

  "The waltz is a very important part of my life. It's a very important way for me to express my positiveness, bringing humor to the world.": "Andre",
  "Suspense is very important. Even though this is humor and they're short stories, that theory of building suspense is still there.": "Sergio",
  "I was pretty much a child of 'Monty Python.' I grew up loving that type of humor and even structured a lot of humor in the same fashion.": "Michael",

  "I think I have always had a little humor.": "Marilyn",

  "I've been encouraging documentary filmmakers to use more and more humor, and they're loath to do that because they think if it's a documentary it has to be deadly serious - it has to be like medicine that you're supposed to take. And I think it's what keeps the mass audience from going to documentaries.": "Michael",
  "In a way, a lot of my humor comes from presenting things that are dramatic or shocking and then people not having socially appropriate responses, having people denying the drama by failing to react to it, and that's a really classic form of humor.": "Chuck",
  "I think people appreciate a songwriter who shows different sides. The whole angst thing is cool, but if that's all you've got, it's just boring. Everything I write, whether it's happy or sad, has a sense of humor to it.": "Katy",
  "Sad music, I always thought, is more beautiful than other music. But at the same time, I am in my personal life a very happy guy. I have a sense of humor. I am not the kind of depressed guy all the time brooding. No. I am very enthusiastic about things.": "Alejandro",

  "People often think that you have a sense of humor because you think that life is funny. Life isn't funny at all. It's appalling and tragic.": "Howard",
  "Edward Norton and I have known each other awhile. I just think he's the real deal, supremely talented and smart. He's got a great sense of humor.": "Kevin",
  "George Carlin is brilliant with words, and Johnny Winters is very creative. It's taking something common and drawing out the humor, being clever with words.": "Bill",
  "Now, Richard Pryor was unique. Many misunderstood his humor. He lit up the hallway, but they didn't understand his use of profanity. He didn't use it just to be using it; he used it in the context of his satire.": "Bill",

  "I love Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart because they're bringing irony back into American humor, which is a delicious treat. The entire Colbert persona of being extreme right-wing when he's not at all is highly amusing. He does it so well, but sometimes a little too well. My wife is convinced he's completely that way.": "John",
  "Bob Dole used to be really funny. Barney Frank can be kind of funny. Bob Kerrey has a good sense of humor.": "Al",

  "I defuse everything I can with it. Humor is such a great shield.": "Brad",
  "Humor has justly been regarded as the finest perfection of poetic genius.": "Thomas",

  "Different taste in jokes is a great strain on the affections.": "George",
  "A lot of people can find something to laugh at in my humor, I guess.": "Ron",

  "I'm still trying to figure out how to write about cancer and my family's experience with it. If I had been able to write 'The Pura Principle' back in those days, I'm positive it would have had no humor in it. Which means the story would have been false.": "Junot",
  "Since the very beginning, Emeril's had a sense of humor about me calling him names and poking fun at him.": "Anthony",

  "In Buddhism, they say attachment to anything only leads to suffering. So when we laugh, it's our way of saying, 'I'm unattached to that.' You're tickled by it, it makes your lobes do something on their own. So humor is very important to me. I always take that to the stage first.": "Jason",
  "People who have any kind of illness use humor as a type of coping.": "Edward",

  "Sometimes when I try to make jokes or have a sense of humor in interviews, it doesn't go over very well. But Twitter made my life easier in this way that I didn't expect.

  "Humor is very interesting to me. My films are not comedies, but there's comedy in them from time to time, absurdities, just like in real life.": "David",
  "It's always the girl comedy and the guy comedy. It bums me out. You'd think there'd be a progression, from James L. Brooks and Nora Ephron into more subtle humor and behavior and psychology. All these interesting things people can learn about themselves by watching talented writers comment intelligently on someone else's emotional life.": "Parker",
  "Our records, if you have a dark sense of humor, were funny, but our records weren't about comedy. They were about protests, fantasy, confrontation and all that.": "Ice",
  "In high drama or high tragedy or anything, it's not really human unless there's some humor at the same time. And vice versa. So I guess I tend to gravitate towards projects which tread a dodgy tightrope between two things, which aren't really one or another.": "Rebecca",

  "It doesn't take many people to have a bad sense of humor to get in trouble at a corporation.": "Scott",

  "A laugh is a surprise. And all humor is physical. I was always athletic, so that came naturally to me.": "Chevy",
  "Let's not call physical comedy falling down and pratfalls. All humor is physical, no matter how you dish it out. It's timing, like a dancer or an athlete would have.": "Chevy",

  "Impropriety is the soul of wit.": "W.",
  "You are not angry with people when you laugh at them. Humor teaches tolerance.": "W.",
  "One of the great things about the Internet is that you can read what everybody has to say about everything. It is fascinating to me, the critiques about humor by people who have no sense of humor.": "Matt",
  "It's funny. People often compare me to other humor essayists. They're usually quite nice comparisons; I will accept those gladly. But I am always sort of appalled at the idea of being lumped with other, more chick-y female writers. And the truth is probably that neither comparison is accurate.": "Sloane",
  "I think a lot of humor is about distracting yourself. Pretend you're not trying to make it funny. Because for some reason the effort to be funny smells like sulphur in our culture.": "Sloane",
  "It's easier to sit there and say you don't like feminists because they don't have a sense of humor.": "Joan",

  "It's an amusing idea to some, this feminism thing - this audacious notion that women should be able to move through the world as freely, and enjoy the same inalienable rights and bodily autonomy, as men. At least, that's the impression given when feminism and feminists are all too often the targets of lazy humor.": "Roxane",

  "People, I guess, generally come to see me do stand-up with a working knowledge of my broad sense of humor on 'The Daily Show'... I don't think anyone would mistake me as an actual anchor.": "John",
  "Writing is not for me. I completely lose my sense of humor when I write. I become extremely pathetic, very sensational. Images give me possibilities that I don't have with words.": "Marjane",
  "I feel like I've always had a sordid sense of humor, and it's only gotten more twisted as I've gotten older.": "Tituss",
  "You can't do anything to be funny. That's cringeworthy. If your humor comes out of a place of love every time, you don't make the joke bigger than you. The funniest comedians are in touch with their emotional level.": "John",

  "Wit is an explosion of the compound spirit.": "Karl",
  "Working on newspapers, you're writing to a certain length, often very brief pieces; you tend to look for easy forms of humor - women can't drive, things like that. That's about the level of a lot of newspaper humor. It becomes a form of laziness.": "Tom",
  "I think 'Country Girl' is one song that can veer into country or hip-hop or rap. You can listen to it and enjoy the humor and the fun in it.": "Luke",
  "I like bawdy humor. I love bawdy humor, but not dirty humor.": "Betty",
  "Sometimes you can take those dramatic roles and maybe interject a little humor into them, and I think the reverse also works.": "Dennis",
  "When I've had to edit my albums, I'll listen to it one time through, and I'll make edits. I want to remember to set up a camera to record myself listening to my set, because I don't even slightly crack a smile, I am just listening for technical details, and I look like somebody that has absolutely no sense of humor. I look insane.": "Tig",
  "My paintings capture the humor, zaniness, and depth of the Batman villains as well as the Freudian motivations of Batman as an all-too-human, venerable, and funny vigilante superhero.": "Adam",

  "I am a political human being. I have - that's one of my interests. I studied political science in college. I was actually going to get my Ph.D. in poli-sci. And a lot of my material from early on in my career dealt with politics, so I've always considered myself as somebody who enjoys political humor. So I'm not going to stop.": "Maz",
  "Humor is always important. There are people who help us deal with difficulty or hardship; from the concentration camps to the court jester, there was a need for humor. As long as these kinds of things exist, with repressive regimes, you need it to deal with the weight of daily life.": "Maz",
  "You have to laugh at yourself. I do a lot of humor about all ethnicities that are at the show - Latinos, Asians, Indians... What I say is, 'We're laughing together. I'm laughing with you, not at you.' Never say, 'Oh, I'm better than you.'": "Maz",
  "I think the main thing about comedy and humor is that it's impossible and always was impossible to define.": "Mike",
  "The people in New York - their humor is on a level that goes, uh, very deep, you know?": "Elaine",
  "I compare Stephen Sondheim with humor, because humor is unanalyzable. You can't analyze humor. You just have to get through it.": "Elaine",
  "Life is never all one thing. It bounces around. Certainly, my own life has. Look at Woody Allen's funny movies - all the humor comes out of sad stuff. Sometimes you have to laugh, no matter what life deals you.": "Tim",
  "Love, as wonderful and horrible as it is, has at its center a kind of pitiful humor.": "Tim",
  "I love the diversity of America. I love the plain, normal sense of humor Americans have. It is not wicked, like in some countries. And I also love how new America is.": "Antonio",

  "Me and Matt love to argue, but in general our sense of humor is pretty much alike.": "Trey",
  "The thing about For Better or Worse is the only thing that made me an okay director for that is that I have a sense of humor, and it was supposed to be funny.": "Jason",
  "I have such a respect for comedy. It's a lot harder than doing drama, in my opinion; you have to have sort of an innate sense of humor. There are rules to comedy you can learn. But ultimately, it really does require a certain point of view on the world, and that really does appeal to me.": "Elizabeth",
  "Everybody in my family had a real sick, twisted sense of humor. Most of the jokes we make in our house, we would just never even dream of making anywhere else. Just sick, horrible stuff. That wasn't anything new to college.": "Seth",
  "Having a sense of humor has served me more than it has hurt me - just in the sense that it has allowed me to keep my sanity.": "Dee",

  "What's great about the geek spirit is that life never seems to stop us, and they never seem to kill our enthusiasm, our optimism and our hunger to experience the world. We keep our sense of humor, we protect our dignity, we talk to our friends about the experience and then we start again fresh the very next day.": "Paul",
  "Women's humor seems to be a little more supportive. It's just kind of trying to make the other one laugh through funny voices and kind of talking about other people. I respond to that. I feel less like I'm going to get beat up in a room full of women than I do in a room full of guys.": "Paul",
  "In Australia, even the darkest subject matter has a little pinch of humor. A little sweet to make the sour go down.": "Ben",

  "I do talk about celebrity relationships like Kim Kardashian's. I like to find the humor in love.": "Loni",
  "I like to be able to feel as many parts of myself while watching a movie at one time. I think that's what 'Super' is - it's funny, but it's also sad. It's very touching in certain ways, and it's also got a very dark sense of humor. So it's allowed to go anywhere.": "James",
  "There are different kinds of humor, some is sarcastic, some introspective. Introspective fit my personality better.": "Rita",
  "Kindness is really important to me in finding my own prince - so are patience and a sense of humor. Without those qualities he's no Prince Charming!": "Anne",

  "Humor comes in all forms, and everyone has their cup of tea about what makes them laugh. But the day we censor humor is a sad one for sure.": "Marlee",
  "I need a woman to have a quirky sense of humor. There's a bunch of jokes I use, and if she doesn't get them, she's probably not for me.": "Matthew",
  "I was intentionally curbing the impulse to be funny and hiding the ability. I wrote any number of very serious attempts at poems, short stories, novels - horrible. At a certain point, I recognized that it was fun to write dialogue that had a degree of lightness and humor.": "Patrick",

  "I just like playing interesting, complex, complicated characters. I like films that also have an element of humor.": "Steve",
  "You either have chemistry or you don't, but a lot of what attracts me is a guy's mind and humor and talent. I need to get to know all those things before I fall for someone.": "Nina",
  "The only way I could get comfortable around people was to make them laugh. I was an obedient girl, and humor was my one form of rebellion. I used comedy to deflect. Like, 'Hey, check out my zit!' - you know, making fun of yourself before someone else has a chance to.": "Tina",
  "I loved Peter Sellers. I thought he was the perfect mix of physical comedy with out-of-the-box humor. I loved his tone I loved his physicality I loved everything about what he was doing as a comedic actor. ": "J.",
  "I love British humor. It's just so - surreal.": "Beck",
  "When I was young, my favorite picture book was 'Fletcher and Zenobia,' written by Edward Gorey and illustrated by Victoria Chess. It's long out of print now, but its mix of macabre humor and 1960s psychedelia made it a perfect children's book for the times.": "Rick",
  "I like guys with a sense of humor who smile a lot and are kind.": "Nikki",

  "I've always had a sick sense of humor, and I've always wanted that to permeate the music because I don't take myself seriously. I take the music seriously, but I know I'm not God's gift to anyone except my mom.": "Josh",
  "I don't have a caustic sense of humor. What I find funny, that humor comes from a much gentler place.": "Vera",
  "I think God gave us senses of humor, and we should use them.": "Vera",
  "I'm drawn to the unconventional because I've been drawn unconventionally. I believe that I'm supposed to topple over these false images of what's idealistically beautiful. Because, of course, these intangible qualities are very attractive to women. Sincerity. Sense of humor. Success.": "CeeLo",
  "I think being a parent is knowing how to love. Sometimes love is discipline, sometimes it's humor, sometimes it's listening.": "Melissa",

  "I just am a snob when it comes to humor.": "Courteney",
  "Humor is a wonderful way to deal with our suffering because if we can laugh at our troubles, we can feel better. Thich Nhat Hanh is a special man who has helped millions with their suffering with incredible technique. But he doesn't know real suffering, because he has not dated as much as I have.": "Garry",
  "I have this horrible sense of humor where I think discomfort is funny - partly because I experience discomfort a lot, and it's a way of laughing at it and getting a release.": "Joaquin",

  "A lot of stars don't have a sense of humor.": "Kathy",
  "My fam is just a regular family. But all of them have great senses of humor.": "Dane",
  "For me, whenever I would see a lot of 'black films,' I didn't feel represented in it. I didn't feel connected to the characters or the situations or the humor.": "Zoe",
  "I'm happy to say that at 62, I think I've reached that point where stuff doesn't bother me as much, and my gratitude level has gone way up, especially having gone through the loss that I've had, and losing so many of the great artists that I was close to. They taught me how to see it with a grain of salt and a lot of humor and perspective.": "Bonnie",
  "One of my favorite things about 'Star Trek' wasn't just the overt banter but the humor in that show about the relationships between the main characters and their reactions to the situations they would face there was a lot of comedy in that show without ever breaking its reality. ": "J.",

  "Being Jewish is a big part of my artistic sensibility and my humor... I think it gives me a certain take on the world on a literary level.": "Adam",

  "It's hard to force creativity and humor.": "Al",
  "No mind is thoroughly well organized that is deficient in a sense of humor.": "Samuel",
  "To me, Ann Romney sounds like a better candidate than her husband. She put her MS into remission through horseback riding, alternative therapies, and a healthy diet. She knows how to pace herself. She has a sense of humor and an innate honesty, and her hair moves in the wind. Maybe she should run.": "Patti",
  "Texas humor and Southern humor are pretty similar.": "Daniel",
  "People are wired for lots of things. We're wired for novelty. We're wired for humor. We're wired for new pieces of information that surprise us in some way or add value to our lives. We're wired for fear.": "Ramez",
  "I don't think I could ever do a network sitcom because the humor is often based on some trite circumstance. I don't want to be a part of a show where it's mostly about coming up with the jokes.": "Sherilyn",
  "Feature-length film comedy is harder to pull off than the episodic sitcom - it doesn't have the same factory machinery up and running, teams of writers putting familiar characters through permutations - but that doesn't explain the widening quality gap that makes movie humor look like a genetic defective.": "James",
  "I don't happen to have a sense of humor personally, so I don't know what's funny about a character... This happens to be a feature of my life generally.": "Wallace",
  "Jon Stewart, Bill Maher, Stephen Colbert. Those are the guys I look at who are telling me pretty much the truth. And they throw humor into it which makes it much more interesting to listen to.": "Grace",

  "For me, humor is everything!": "Judy",

  "I get asked, 'How can you have such failures in your films?' Well, what else is life about? There's some sense of constant failure in something. Humor gives you a distance from it.": "Alexander",
  "I don't really have a type. I don't want to be a cliche. But personality is a big thing for me. You can find cute guys all over. But he's got to have some sort of sense of humor, which is so hard to find in a guy. He's got to be a bit smart.": "Zara",

  "I think the thrust of any child is to try to fit in and be part of it. And I can't tell you how many times my humor, you know, what I thought was humor ended up making me the outsider. Like I'd be, I go, 'It's a joke.' And they'd go, 'Well, what was funny?' And they just thought I was insane.": "Howie",
  "Part of my humor is the fact that I love coming out of left field. I don't want people to expect what is going to happen next.": "Howie",
  "In conversation, humor is worth more than wit and easiness more than knowledge.": "George",
  "I like doing comedy, I like doing drama. Naturally I like to do, I like doing dramas, I like conflict, and when I do a comedy, you know, I've found that, like, romantic comedy is the trickiest one, because often it's neither: it's not romantic and it's not funny. So, like, I like a comedy that's biting. It's biting humor or really quirky humor.": "Matt",
  "Our ability to find humor in the world, to make connections between previously unconnected notions, to create new ideas, to share in a common culture: All these essentially human acts depend on memory.": "Joshua",

  "And humor has always been a weapon. You want to get even on somebody? You want to attack somebody? Make fun of them.": "Alan",
  "There's a charm, there's a rhythm, there's a soul to Jewish humor. When I first saw Richard Pryor perform, I told him, 'You're doing a Jewish act.'": "Alan",
  "What we're doing is fun - if you have any sense of humor at all!": "Calvin",
  "I like to deal with EVERY aspect of our condition, and that means terror and humor in equal mix. Some books have more room for humor than others.": "Dean",
  "I need a man with a good sense of humor and a kind heart.": "Joanna",
  "I like Strahan a lot. I've known him for years. He was a Giant here - in many ways. Had a big following with the New York Giants. He's very funny. He's got a great sense of humor.": "Regis",

  "Life is just so much fun and so filled with humor.": "Foster",
  "I would say just start writing. You've got to write every day. Copy someone that you like if you think that perhaps could become your sound, too. I did that with Hemingway, and I thought I was writing just like Hemingway. Then all of a sudden it occurred to me - he didn't have a sense of humor. I don't know anything he's written that's funny.": "Elmore",
  "Humor reminds you, when you're flattened by sorrow, that you're still human.": "Elizabeth",

  "People come up to me as I leave the stage after a performance and tell me tey saw my mother onstage with me every time I sing. I keep a sense of humor about it.": "Lorna",
  "Short fiction is like low relief. And if your story has no humor in it, then you're trying to look at something in the pitch dark. With the light of humor, it throws what you're writing into relief so that you can actually see it.": "Elizabeth",
  "There are two MFA programs here at the University of Texas, and I read on the jury of both of them. And it's amazing to me how many really talented young writers seem to fear humor.": "Elizabeth",
  "A lot of people into Tool, for some reason, are not interested in humor.": "Maynard",
  "If golf wasn't enjoyable and there wasn't a lot of humor and enjoyment, even though the game is so frustrating, you would wonder why you put yourself through it.": "Ray",
  "The comics that are just conversing with you up there and drawing on their own life, yeah, I guess so. I guess some do political humor, some do topical humor, but the ones that I like, the ones that are appealing to me, were guys who were just talking to you about their life.": "Ray",
  "I never worry about people not taking my work seriously as a result of the humor. In the end, the comic's best trick is the illusion that comedy is effortless. That people imagine what he's doing is easy is an occupational hazard.": "Richard",
  "Quite often, intent on conveying how things can go wrong for a culture (science fiction) or an individual (horror) or all of magical creation (fantasy), works of fantastika often preclude comedy, because humor gets in the way of messages of doom or struggle.": "Paul",
  "I've heard too many times where people say that I'm this ultra-serious guy. In truth, I've got an extremely absurd sense of humor. I thrive on the absurd - I love it.": "Phil",
  "My own life is wonderful, but if I had to live the life of someone else, I'd gladly choose that of Julia Child or Dr. Seuss: two outrageously original people, each of whom fashioned an idiosyncratic wisdom, passion for life, and sense of humor into an art form that anyone and everyone could savor.": "Julia",

  "I think it's hilarious at 40 years old to bring out my roller skates from 'Starlight Express.' I find the humor and even the sadness in it hilarious and something to celebrate.": "Jane",
  "With Ricky Gervais, it's all shades of wrong, it's my kind of humor.": "Emily",
  "It's just my natural way - to be funny. I don't know why that is. But as I've said, humor is a quick cover for shock, horror, confusion. The critics hate funny writers for the most part. They think funny is not serious, but I think that funny can be even more serious than nonfunny. And it can be more affecting, too.": "T.",
  "If I ever have sex with someone I might be able to develop a sense of humor.": "Kate",
  "To me, sadness and humor aren't disrelated and humor is the best tool I've had against the sadness in my life.": "Mike",
  "I think that sense of humor is important in marriage. A sense of humor gets people through marriage.": "Kyle",
  "Sometimes a scene may be about one thing, and it may end up still being about that, but the emotionality of it comes from somewhere else, or the humor of it comes from somewhere else, and it gives it that real-life quality.": "Kyle",
  "I really hate sitcoms on television with canned laughter and stuff. What really makes me laugh is the real-life stuff. I've got a dry sense of humor.": "Katie",
  "I wish I could be as thin as Jessica Simpson. I think she looks gorgeous! I have had Jessica on my show several times, and I can tell you that girl is genuine and funny with a great self-deprecating sense of humor.": "Rachael",
  "It's continuously humbling to work hard, you know? As long as you've got a good work ethic and a sense of humor, I don't think anybody can become too much of an egoist under those circumstances.": "Rachael",
  "Laughter is involuntary. If it's funny you laugh.": "Tom",
  "My books are shelved in different places, depending on the bookstore. Sometimes they can be found in the Mystery section, sometimes in the Humor department, and occasionally even in the Literature aisle, which is somewhat astounding.": "Carl",
  "Humor can be an incredible lacerating and effective weapon. And that is the way I use it.": "Carl",
  "Daddy was hilarious. He could take the most mundane event and tell it so that we all on the floor laughing. He trained me in the joys of humor.": "Karen",
  "I like dark humor. My favorite movie of all time is 'Harold and Maude.'": "Leslie",
  "Humor is the only way to tell a story. Especially the dark ones.": "Lisa",
  "I've always adored the filmmaker Sam Fuller. The first time I watched 'Shock Corridor' was such a magnificent discovery. I love his lack of subtlety, the way he tackles serious topics with bold and inappropriate humor.": "Lisa",
  "Every time I've done comedy in, like, traditional comedy clubs, there's always these comedians that do really well with audiences but that the other comedians hate because they're just, you know, doing kind of cheap stuff like dancing around or doing, like, very kind of base sex humor a lot, and stuff like that.": "Aziz",
  "Over the years, I've learned that a sense of humor is the only skill that allows you to turn sucking at life into a career.": "Zach",
  "My childhood was great because my family has an amazing sense of humor, and it was just all making videos and jokes and doing skits and things.": "Zach",
  "My parents and my brother instilled in me my sense of humor. That's kind of the way we communicate with each other, and it's always been a way for me to get to know people.": "Zach",
  "Depending on where my self-confidence was, growing up, I would use humor either to bring people closer, or to keep them away from certain feelings I had.": "Zach",
  "Humor disarms people. It opens them up to starting a dialogue about things they wouldn't normally talk about. I don't understand how people who don't have a sense of humor get through life.": "Zach",
  "Even when something sad or tragic happens, I find a way to look at it in a positive light. People who don't have a sense of humor must be so sad all the time.": "Zach",
  "It's amazing how many companies aren't really in tune to the needs of different travelers. There's just so many embarrassing situations that you go through when you travel. You have to have a sense of humor about it and take it in stride. My whole approach is to embrace spontaneity.": "Zach",
  "People who know me know I have a sense of humor that can really push the envelope.": "Carmen",
  "I was always silly in high school. I used to always get in trouble because I was laughing. I've always thought I was funny but never thought I could use it to make money. In 1996, I decided I was going to use my humor to get on TV to make money.": "Retta",
  "My humor is a lot like Kristen Wiig's from 'Saturday Night Live' or 'Bridesmaids.' Quirky, off the beaten path.": "Nicole",
  "Every black film feels like it's Tyler Perry, and that just needs to stop. But people seem to slowly be looking for what else is out there - 'Is there something else besides this type of humor?' 'I'm tired of seeing men in dresses.'": "Issa",
  "Puns are a form of humor with words.": "Guillermo",
  "I don't know if my sense of humor goes over Americans' heads.": "Ryan",

  "I've always been a fan of a Johnny Carson because he was so great with an audience and not afraid of self-deprecating humor.": "Vince",
  "For the most part, comedians are pretty friendly with each other. They always say they badmouth each other, but most of the time, they're friends. We're the only ones that can really stand our type of humor.": "Colin",
  "Jerry Seinfeld is amazing in many ways, not the least of them his ability to find humor, and convincing us to find it, too, in the million-and-two details about modern life that under different circumstances might send us into paroxysms of rage.": "Tom",
  "My parents have always had a great sense of humor. And I really appreciate good humor in songs, witty lyrics that sneak up on you and then you listen again, and say: 'That's so funny.' John Prine's songs have always had this really witty tone.": "Kacey",
  "If you're playing a good guy, you show some darkness. If you're playing a dark guy, you show something different, like humor, that will mix it up and hopefully surpass the audience's expectations. What I'm battling all the time is complacency in the audience. I try to bring a little mystery to what might happen because that engages people more.": "Campbell",
  "Well, darkness with humor... I'm not an extremely suicidal or sad person.": "Peter",
  "As far as humor goes, I've always been a very insecure person and I've always wanted to be liked.": "Peter",
  "The woman who runs the Pennsylvania Innocence Project told me that there's a man she's been trying to get out of prison for 26 years. Every night before she goes to bed, she thinks, 'What is he doing?' She says you don't sleep. And yet, she has the greatest sense of humor and this light that comes out of her.": "Richard",
  "You probably found 'How to Survive a Robot Uprising' in the humor section. Let's just hope that is where it belongs.": "Daniel",
  "There was a time I was very much blaming the way I felt on L.A, that it was a vacuum of creativity, of humor or anything organic, and I was really angry at the place. But then today I feel completely different - I love L.A.!": "Naomi",
  "You've got to have a sense of humor to keep your sanity.": "Lance",
  "I have wit in my work and a sense of humor, but I do not use irony in any way.": "John",
  "I think in my case, I had no choice but to have a good sense of humor. I grew up with my dad, Danny Thomas, and George Burns and Bob Hope and Milton Berle and Sid Caesar and all those guys were at our house all the time and telling jokes and making each other laugh.": "Marlo",
  "The rejection that we all take and the sadness and the aggravation and the loss of jobs and all of the things that we live through in our lives, without a sense of humor, I don't know how people make it.": "Marlo",
  "I'm a comedian, and I have my share of anxiety and depression; so do most of my friends. My humor tends to lie in the juxtaposition of extreme lightness - I'm a huge musical-theater fan - and extreme darkness. And so I really like playing with those because that's how I feel.": "Rachel",
  "I'm not sure. But that bless-his/her-heart kind of melancholic humor is among my favorite things in the world. I guess it exposes a kind of humanity - or that's the hope, at least - a kind of grudging respect for human frailty. Unless it's actually kicking human frailty while it's down - I'm not sure.": "David",
  "I'm looking at some comedic horror films because I have often been accused of being too dark. I'm not dark, not compared with 'Saw' or anything like that. So I'm looking at live-action horror films, but not slasher ones - ones that have humor and maybe some social satire.": "Henry",
  "It's amazing how these little guys can say things that a mortal human could never get away with. There's some sort of unspoken license... when outlandish things come out of an inanimate object, somehow it equals humor.": "Jeff",
  "I've worked a lot in comedy. As much as I love playing dramatic roles, it's always nice to be able to have some humor around when working.": "Tom",
  "Lucifer has a sense of fun about life he just likes to play with people. But the sense of humor of the show is what makes the show entertaining as opposed to dark. ": "Tom",
  "There's some sort of unspoken license... when outlandish things come out of an inanimate object, somehow it equals humor.": "Jeff",
  "It is characteristic of all deep human problems that they are not to be approached without some humor and some bewilderment.": "Freeman",
  "Reilly Brown is a master of balancing action, humor, and extreme violence, and his character designs for some of the alien races and technology that we encounter is just amazing.": "Cullen",
  "I can't be as open on national television as I can when I'm having dinner with friends. But that doesn't mean the type of person I am is different. My values, my dislikes, my sense of humor are the same.": "Matt",
  "Be fun! I don't like homes or rooms that don't have a sense of humor or have some sense of whimsy or a personality. Your home should reflect who you are, and what you love. I would never have something in my home because it's the thing to have. I have to love it and it needs some connection to me.": "Bryan",
  "My parents and my sister died... very close together, and after that, I lost quite a bit of my sense of humor. Most of it I think has kind of come back, but I know there was a time when I didn't think things were funny anymore. I kind of think they're funny again.": "Thomas",
  "God has a most wicked sense of humor.": "Maureen",

  "I learned early in my career to not let myself get in the way of humor but, instead, find what is great in a talented person.": "Tamra",
  "I always had to genuinely like the actors I worked with and use my enthusiasm and vision to give them confidence to push their creativity and their humor.": "Tamra",
  "My humor tends to be a little more edgy than is appropriate for 'Twilight,' although I got some in there. That was fun! There's just a tonal difference. For me, storytelling is storytelling. But, I do like writing for grown ups.": "Melissa",
  "Don't wish me happiness - I don't expect to be happy it's gotten beyond that, somehow. Wish me courage and strength and a sense of humor - I will need them all.": "Anne",
  "The way humor's usually used in horror, it's as a pressure-release valve; without it, the drama would escalate out of all control almost immediately.": "Stephen",
  "Whatever else an American believes or disbelieves about himself, he is absolutely sure he has a sense of humor.": "E.",
  "When you meet someone new who instantly gets you, your sense of humor and your attitudes and your worldview, even if theirs are different - and you get them in return. You both talk and talk and agree and laugh and nod and yes, yes, of course you should get another round of drinks.": "Erin",
  "You can't be funny if you don't have good material.": "Matt",
  "Both conservatives and liberals watch 'Parks and Recreation,' and they each think the show is for them, which is really cool. 'SNL' was totally different. It was exciting because everyone was paying attention. Political humor works when people know what you're talking about.": "Amy",
  "Humor is perhaps a sense of intellectual perspective: an awareness that some things are really important, others not; and that the two kinds are most oddly jumbled in everyday affairs.": "Christopher",
  "There are so many things to talk about between black people, Hispanic people, white people, gay people, men, women, it's all based on fear. We all have fears, this thing that stops us from embracing as we are one. We are never going to be one. People are messed up, but humor lets us see how ignorant we can be.": "Marlon",
  "You learn timing on the road. You learn structure and how to read an audience. You learn so much about the business of laughter that you can't learn on a set, because it's all on you. Sometimes you bomb, and you know not to tell that joke again... You just hope people find the humor in the awkwardness.": "Marlon",
  "It felt as if things were literally slipping through my fingers. Things were just streaming away from me. I lost my sense of humor. I'm still looking for that.": "Michelle",
  "With actors like Steve McQueen, Paul Newman and Harrison Ford, what made them such icons is that even in dramatic movies, their characters had a sense of humor.": "Patrick",
  "I try to cope with everything through humor.": "Gail",
  "I came into the 'Comedy Bang! Bang!' TV show with a level of confidence that I don't think I would've had if I hadn't been doing the podcast for three years already. I certainly had to figure out in those three years the sense of humor I wanted to do and the way to talk to celebrities without being incredibly intimidated by them.": "Scott",
  "If I can't see the humor in it, how am I going to be funny?": "Casey",
  "The guys in my band are great-we watch movies, we eat pizza, take walks, read books. Everybody has a really great sense of humor. And my boyfriend comes and visits me on the road.": "Lisa",

  "If somebody is not on the same page with me humor wise, I can't give them that.": "Stephan",
  "Brits have a better sense of humor in most ways. It's darker, more cutting.": "Stephan",
  "Maybe the bar is low, but most of the strips that are 50, 60, 70 years old that are on their second or third generation of artists, the humor is pretty bland. There are others by people that were raised on 'Family Guy' or 'South Park' that are edgier. Mine's not as edgy as those, but it's edgier than 'Beetle Bailey.'": "Stephan",
  "Thomas, my 15-year-old, is effectively my editor, I've always trusted his voice, more than anybody, on the strip for years. He has one of those ears that's just tuned to the rhythm of humor, so if he says something's not funny, my stomach just hurts because I know he's right, and it's already been drawn.": "Stephan",
  "I think there's always room for humor, especially when you're talking about really serious issues.": "Jay",
  "I thought I was going to be known for my humor. But then I had an idea for a story, which was absolutely not humorous. But, of course, that's the one that sells and becomes big.": "Jay",
  "It's always amazed me how little attention philosophers, psychologists, or anyone else actually has paid to humor.": "Edward",
  "I still haven't found the humor in getting hit by a cement truck. My knees still hurt when I think about it, so no jokes about that yet.": "Adam",
  "I think sometimes my humor is extremely dry, and a lot of times I would say things that I thought were very funny but... I have a reputation of - people think of me as a very fundamentalist, humorless fellow.": "Ian",
  "Humor does not diminish the pain - it makes the space around it get bigger.": "Allen",
  "When you do find humor in trying times, one of the first and most important changes you experience is that you see your perplexing problems in a new way - you suddenly have a new perspective on them.": "Allen",
  "When we are dealing with death we are constantly being dragged down by the event: Humor diverts our attention and lifts our sagging spirits.": "Allen",
  "Whether planned or not, humor takes our mind off of our troubles.": "Allen",
  "Any attempts at humor immediately after September 11th were deemed tasteless.": "Allen",
  "Since the goal of my programs is to show audiences how humor can both help them heal as well as deal with not-so-funny stuff, I decided to discuss the events of the previous week, the pain all of us were feeling, and how humor and some laughter might be beneficial.": "Allen",
  "In looking for humor, keep in mind this guideline: Sometimes it takes a little time to see the humor in your upsets; you may not find something to laugh about immediately.": "Allen",
  "When we can find some humor in our upsets, they no longer seem as large or as important as they once did.": "Allen",
  "Humor expands our limited picture frame and gets us to see more than just our problem.": "Allen",

  "People with no humor, they're outta my life.": "Patti",
  "I visited Jobs for the last time in his Palo Alto, Calif., home. He had moved to a downstairs bedroom because he was too weak to go up and down stairs. He was curled up in some pain, but his mind was still sharp and his humor vibrant.": "Walter",
  "Some major writers have a huge impact, like Ayn Rand, who to my mind is a lousy fiction writer because her writing has no compassion and virtually no humor. She has a philosophical and economical message that she is passing off as fiction, but it really isn't fiction at all.": "Theodore",
  "I think all good drama is funny. All the best drama is ultimately very funny. Life is funny. You can't have any honest treatise on life without bumping into some humor.": "Thomas",
  "Because I was a television writer for many years, I write very conversationally. I put things straight, and with a lot of humor.": "Tracy",
  "Stephen King has inspired me with his humor and honesty, and his admonition that the author's job is to tell the truth.": "Barry",
  "There is humor in the darkest of moments - People who I have loved and passed away, and very high stake situations where you can't help but laugh. I think that's very human.": "Rose",
  "Humor is always more interesting when it comes from someone who's had more than, like, five experiences.": "Mallory",
  "One of the things that would be great is to some day have so many women comedy writers that we wouldn't say there's just one type of female humor. There's lots.": "Mallory",
  "In prehistoric times, mankind often had only two choices in crisis situations: fight or flee. In modern times, humor offers us a third alternative; fight, flee - or laugh.": "Robert",
  "Humor starts like a wildfire, but then continues on, smoldering, smoldering for years.": "Robert",
  "I remember when humor was gentle pokes. I used to call it 'arm around the shoulder' humor. Now they go for the jugular and they take no prisoners. It's mean, mean stuff.": "Robert",
  "President Ford used humor a great deal.": "Robert",
  "I think that humor is part of what saves us from despair.": "John",
  "My dad was a very funny man - he's the one who taught me life would be awfully hard without humor! I'm sure his Irish wit in some way influenced my decision to become an actress.": "Joan",
  "I'm a big fan of gallows humor. When my aunt passed away, she was in a coma for a day before my cousins pulled the plug. And the amount of joking and base humor that went on that day around her bed was so insane. It's crazy how people talk when something horrible is happening.": "Amanda",
  "There are psychological repercussions to illness and we need a little more help to get through the effects not only on the afflicted but on the family. And I think there's even a place for humor in that.": "Alan",
  "I don't really like using ridicule as a form of humor.": "Alison",
  "A pun is the lowest form of humor, unless you thought of it yourself.": "Doug",
  "There seems to be no lengths to which humorless people will not go to analyze humor. It seems to worry them.": "Robert",
  "I have this idyllic love life, but my mind just won't accept that. I would like to bring a new guy home every night. I try to make humor out of that situation.": "Jen",
  "I will say that as I get older and calmer and quieter in my own self, the one quality in a woman that I find more and more attractive is kindness. A sense of adventure and humor is important too, but I truly find kindness and consideration for others to be the most attractive thing in anyone.": "Colin",
  "I'll do humor about myself, I'll poke fun and everything, but that's me and I can do it to me. I think it's cruel to do it to somebody else.": "Delta",
  "M*A*S*H offered real characters and everybody identified with them because they had such soul. The humor was intelligent and it always assumed that you had an intellect.": "Loretta",
  "I think the Canadian sense of humor is dryer than America's and juicier than Britain's. I think it's a cross between the two of them, really.": "Scott",
  "I was born in England - though both of my parents are American - and there's something about the 'Muppets' where they have this combination of English and American humor.": "Nicholas",
  "There's a lot of movies, and I've made some of them that could be categorized this way, but there's definitely been a trend in animated features of all types to be a little bit cynical, if you will, to have a little bit of 'knowing' humor to them, kind of a wink to the audience.": "Kelly",
  "I talk about race and culture, and that's what my fans respond to. If you grew up in an environment where race and culture were never an issue for you, or where you don't see the humor in our so-called differences, then you might not respond to what I'm doing.": "Russell",
  "Men love it. They have a sense of humor, whereas a lot of women are threatened or just don't get it.": "Lara",
  "Comedy, we may say, is society protecting itself - with a smile.": "J.",
  "Even celebrities, most people have a sense of humor. Most of the people we meet who we've done on the show, like it.": "Matt",
  "I love the idea of things being strict and things being uniform. That's the reason why I surround each collection with humor or irony. I want to make sure that it's not too serious and that there is some element that throws it off because otherwise that would make it really boring. There's always a story that's somewhat fantastical.": "Thom",
  "I wasn't close to my father, but I wanted to be all my life. He had a funny sense of humor, and he laughed all the time - good and loud, like I do. He was a gay Irish gentleman and very good-looking. And he wanted to be close to me, too, but we never had much time together.": "Judy",
  "What a strange world this would be if we all had the same sense of humor.": "Bernard",
  "Russian humor is to adapt or make some sense or nonsense out of the insanity of their lives.": "Ian",
  "People in Russia adapt to misery by a deep, deep humor.": "Ian",
  "I don't have a disregard for my reader in humor pieces.": "Ian",
  "I think what is important for things to be funny is if you the listener, or the reader, get a chance to supply the humor of it yourself.": "Ian",
  "With reporting, if you work hard, you can usually pull something out. But writing humor doesn't respond to working hard, necessarily. I mean, you could just sit there and look at the page all day and maybe something will come.": "Ian",
  "Writing humor for me is more like a watchful-ness. You have to watch. When you say something funny, or someone else does, it's more like you wait for the piece.": "Ian",
  "My fans have great senses of humor and eat too much chocolate.": "Christopher",
  "As a kid, I loved 'Godot' because of the poetry and the humor and the strangeness, but then as you get older, it's much more resonant.": "Nathan",
  "I think in life, the sense of humor and comedy always exists.": "Mike",
  "Sometimes Americans don't quite get my sense of humor. My good ol' British sarcasm seems to go over their heads.": "Lee",
  "I appreciate humor so much, but I'm actually not a funny girl.": "Emmanuelle",
  "I was a little shocked at how adult some of the humor was, because I was never that into animation before and when I watched 'Shrek' I really laughed out loud.": "Cheryl",
  "Rowling is a luminous storyteller. I love her sense of humor and the intricate wizarding world she built around Hogwarts. I think all writers aspire to be like her, to capture readers like she does. But I didn't think about 'Harry Potter' when I wrote 'The Bone Season.'": "Samantha",
  "I have a very silly sense of humor. I've never laughed harder in my entire life than seeing someone with toilet paper stuck on the bottom of their shoe.": "Paula",
  "The love of truth lies at the root of much humor.": "Robertson",
  "If you look at the game and everything, it's not quite like looking at an animated film, because that's total character. This, this is really movement, but it's got funny little things if you look for the humor. They're actually getting to the character.": "Don",
  "The whole ability to look at the complexity of race and any sort of associated -ism and still find humor, that's a very interesting space.": "Rashid",
  "Funny songs aren't usually that good. Like Weird Al and maybe a couple of Beatles songs, but it's kind of hard to bring humor into rock music in an interesting way.": "Win",
  "I lean toward anything with a dark sense of humor. And since I've been out of school, the majority of my books have been contemporary; basically, I like my characters to have electricity - even better, a TV.": "Andrea",
  "The more women sit down and write something in a woman's voice for a woman, they more you'll see women in comedy because gender doesn't define sense of humor. Imagination and intelligence and perspective do.": "Kristen",
  "Rather than writing about my experiences with other people, 'Ugly Cherries' is the first song I've ever written about myself. It's a confrontation: an attempt to unpack my own queerness with humor and self care.": "Ben",
  "You are not just a funny person or just a journalist. Most people are hybrids of having a smart opinion and a great sense of humor.": "Katie",
  "My dad is just like everybody else's dad. I see him as kind of a goofy guy with a great sense of humor. I try to get in a battle of wits with him, but he always gets me. I emulate him because I've never seen anyone work as hard as he does.": "Peter",
  "Food is sort of like the Jewish sense of humor, a defense mechanism. It is one of the things that helped the Jews survive through 2,000 years of an often very harsh Diaspora.": "Gil",
  "Insult is powerful. Insult begets both rage and humor and often at the same time.": "Suzanne",
  "I'm not an expert on the Malaysian sense of humor.": "Ben",
  "There is a collective as well as an individual humor inclining peoples to sadness or cheerfulness, making them see things in bright or somber lights. In fact, only society can pass a collective opinion on the value of human life; for this the individual is incompetent.": "Emile",
  "I think probably the qualities that I look for in a man are somewhat different than they were before I became a public person, but not that much different. I think that, sort of, the element of trust is certainly much bigger for me, but the other things that - the other qualities, intelligence and kindness and sense of humor, those things.": "Monica",
  "Along with a sense of humor, my songs have to be sincere, and they have to be sung from a position of inner conviction.": "Arlo",
  "Sometimes the only way to make palatable that which is appalling and apprehensive is to season it with some humor.": "Terrence",
  "I think hip-hop does a very good job of infusing comedy and humor and wit into music, a lot more than other genres.": "Carrie",
  "With Portlandia, I don't think our intention is always to find something funny. Sometimes the humor comes from taking something really seriously. We're okay with making somebody feel uncomfortable or uneasy.": "Carrie",
  "Cathy was the first widely syndicated humor strip created by a woman. The strip was pretty revolutionary at the time not only because it starred a female, but also because it was so emotionally honest about all the conflicting feelings many women had in 1976.": "Cathy",
  "I'm lucky that my real-life Mom has both a great sense of humor about herself and an amazing ability to slip into complete denial if the subject matter gets a little too close to home.": "Cathy",
  "Humor comes from the surprise release of some buried tension.": "Lorrie",
  "There's a hysterical, tired sense of humor that comes after working 14 hours a day, six days a week. I like those things because they take the pressure off the constant stress.": "Tom",
  "Both of my kids have my sense of humor - they're definitely entertaining.": "Jodie",
  "Someone asked me what the key to being a good frontman was, and I think having a sense of humor about it is pretty near the top of that list. It's a very strange place to be in, and I don't take that role too seriously.": "Alex",
  "I'd probably describe my sense of humor as 'twisted,' I guess. It's not hard to make me laugh, especially when I'm surrounded by my close friends, especially my bandmates.": "Mac",
  "They don't make you pay for the humor. It's up and down, but they're trying to give you as many laughs as possible in 2 minutes. They are the most honest comedians ever.": "Mike",
  "If you don't infuse humor into a subject matter, no matter how dark, the audience can't accept the message of a film. It closes them down. Humor can open them up.": "Theodore",
  "Confidence and a good sense of humor can usually win a chick over.": "Danny",
  "If it gets laughs, it's funny.": "Rachel",
  "He was just trying to tease me - I knew that later - but he said he'd have to leave because it wasn't fair to have anyone in the room who was going to make fun of what he had to say. He had a good sense of humor, really.": "Fay",
  "My dad's sense of humor was direct and sometimes surreal - his quick wit is well known amongst our family and friends. He raised me on Spike Jones records and W.C. Fields movies, and his sense of humor fell somewhere in between.": "Tony",
  "Bands from Akron have a sense of humor and don't tend to take themselves too seriously.": "Dan",
  "I'm not for gratuitous nudity, but if there's humor, I don't have a problem.": "Rebecca",
  "I have a dark sense of humor.": "Olivia",
  "However, frat-boy humor is funny and it always will be.": "Craig",

  "I think it would be hard to go the distance in this business without a sense of humor.": "Patricia",
  "Women, as they grow older, rely more and more on cosmetics. Men, as they grow older, rely more and more on a sense of humor.": "George",
  "A farce, or slapstick humor, does well universally.": "John",
  "Sure, the comedians who swear or use scatological humor can get laughs, but they're uncomfortable laughs.": "John",
  "Do feminists have a sense of humor? Yes.": "Gloria",
  "There's such an odd, eclectic group of people that make up the town of Plymouth, New Hampshire. I don't think I could avoid not coming out of there with a pretty good sense of humor.": "Eliza",
  "I never particularly thought of myself as great with girls. I can be awkward, and I have a strange sense of humor at times. But I've also been learning to try and embrace that.": "Matt",
  "My dad has a dry, deadpan sense of humor, and my mom has an unexpected, wacky take on things. They really encouraged laughing at ourselves and the weirdness of situations that come up growing up in politics.": "Kristin",
  "Both of my parents have great senses of humor.": "Kristin",
  "I like good humor.": "John",
  "Even as a kid I was never the generator of humor, but I always knew who was funny, who to hang out with.": "Andrew",
  "Athletes tend to have less of a sense of humor than most people. They are heroes to so many. That might be part of it.": "Jeff",
  "Humor that is edgy is never squeaky clean.": "Jeff",
  "A taste for irony has kept more hearts from breaking than a sense of humor, for it takes irony to appreciate the joke which is on oneself.": "Jessamyn",
  "I always felt different as a kid, and the Kinks were like, 'Yeah, we're the Kinks.' Celebrate your difference; don't be afraid of your sense of humor, or your personality, or who you are. It emboldened me.": "Michael",
  "I liked the humor of it, I've always enjoyed a sense of humor in God and in religion and in spirituality.": "Amber",
  "Conservative humor is frankly harder than liberal humor. You get points for just being liberal. You can get more points if you make fun of your own side sometimes.": "Ted",
  "The polls indicated that I was feisty, that I was tough, that I had a sense of humor, but they weren't quite sure if they liked me and they didn't know whether or not that I was sensitive.": "Geraldine",
  "I try to bring it across on my record, in my dress, in what I do and what I say because to me humor is important. You should have a dose of that and I guess giving it is what I'm here for.": "Bootsy",
  "I genuinely liked all of the cast members very much. Steve had a wicked sense of humor. I remember Russell coming to my rescue, once. I watched Eric evolve before everyone's eyes. Maurice loved what he did, so. He treated his character with respect, down to the costuming.": "Madeleine",
  "With humor, it's so subjective that trying to think of what the ideal reader would think would drive you crazy.": "Calvin",
  "There's always a source for humor.": "Calvin",
  "Those who knew Lincoln described him as an extraordinarily funny man. Humor was an essential aspect of his temperament. He laughed, he explained, so he did not weep.": "Doris",
  "Evangelicals always assume that humor and faith are contradictory. It's OK to smile, to be nice, but not frivolous.": "Mike",
  "I think up until the point when we started in the business, which was in the early '70s, most of the humor was political. The smart humor was political satire.": "David",
  "I'm not too modest of a person. I've got a pretty blue sense of humor.": "Michelle",
  "I have a very dark sense of humor.": "Andy",
  "We're starting to push the envelope in terms of the expectations, and you can also have your own style, personality and sense of humor, because now we're allowed to.": "Lisa",
  "Humor is rare in science fiction... there's so little of it that it automatically reminds you of other heroes with that acerbic humor when you find it.": "John",
  "When I did 'Sex and the City,' it was like, 'Let's do a comedy where the humor is not coming from innuendo but from the a truthful place. This is a show where we're going to be able to say and do what we want.'": "Darren",
  "I think the next best thing to solving a problem is finding some humor in it.": "Frank",
  "Humor's always been the problem of my work, hasn't it? When working, I feel satisfied when I surprise myself. And when I surprise myself, I wind up laughing.": "Kara",
  "I did the 'Bionic Woman,' which of course had a lot of humor in it, and that was really a function of a lot of the ad-libbing and the things that I did in it.": "Lindsay",
  "While it is true that Frank had a great sense of humor, he was also very serious about composing music. In reality there are only a handful of skilled players who can play his most complex pieces. It takes a lot of patience to learn and requires a fantastic memory.": "Dweezil",
  "I've always littered my songs with jokes. You might need to dig a little deeper to find the humor, but I would totally object to being some kind of distraught personality. I've never tried to attach myself to that.": "Cass",
  "I manage through a sense of humor. We all work hard, and work has to be a really interesting, fun place. And that has to start at the top.": "Carol",
  "My own inclination is to skew towards humor. They say that some people view life as a comedy, others as a tragedy. Me? Comedy all the way.": "Lauren",
  "Jazz can be so serious, no sense of humor.": "Chad",
  "Academics tend to have wonderfully infantile senses of humor.": "John",
  "Leonard Cohen has a way with words and with humor that remind me to lighten up, which I appreciate very much.": "Damien",
  "I mean, yeah, I'm sure that Python and the other things have paved the way for a greater understanding of the British sense of humor, but I don't think it's all that different than the American sense of humor.": "Simon",
  "I think at its best the American sense of humor is the same as the British sense of humor at its best, which is to be wry and ironic and self deprecating.": "Simon",
  "I don't really dissect comedy. Nothing kills off humor more than overanalyzing it.": "David",
  "Roosevelt's humor was broad, his manner friendly. Of wit there was little; of philosophy, none. What did he possess? Intuition, inspiration, love of adventure.": "Emanuel",
  "I think shows that are completely dramatic are a lie. People use humor to cope. That is how we deal with things. In the darkest situations, there's humor. And if you don't show that, you're not being true to real life.": "Jenji",
  "You feel like you need to deal with a lot if you're from Cleveland, so you learn to let things roll off your back, and you learn that humor is the best way to deal with it.": "Vanessa",
  "Comedy is still alive, and there are still funny people. Jews are still overrepresented in comedy and psychiatry and underrepresented in the priesthood. That immigrant Jewish humor is still with us.": "Robert",
  "I'd like to explore the more abstract side of people's minds, as opposed to the usual sitcom stuff. I don't want to do the typical sitcom-type humor. I'd want to do stuff like go bowling with pineapples.": "Harland",
  "I don't think my sense of humor has changed at all; I was born with this, for better or for worse.": "Ivan",
  "But it also became the experience, or was the experience, of the writers who were attracted to this kind of humor. They're all men or women who come from the same kind of experience in their own lives.": "Norman",
  "I've always chosen my band members based on their sense of humor. It might sound stupid, but it means not only are they fun to live with on a tour bus for years, but humor implies intelligence.": "Kristin",
  "I'll let you in on a secret: I can't stand Jay Ward. I hate being compared to Rocky and Bullwinkle. It's just a different style of humor.": "John",
  "Joe Barbera's s always complaining that he can't get humor into cartoons anymore. Just do it. You've got your money. Why do they let the networks run their lives?": "John",
  "But if you read Jane Austen, you know that she had a wicked sense of humor. Not only was she funny, but her early writing was very dark and had a gothic tone to it.": "Seth",
  "I find any sort of acting that doesn't have any humor in it is mind-numbingly boring. 'Serious acting' is the kind of acting that I don't ever respond to.": "Andrew",
  "My uncle worked in emergency wards dealing with people who came in with terrible injuries. He talked about the sketch shows they would put on to lighten the atmosphere. You often find this sense of grim humor in hospitals. The injuries people are suffering are ghastly. You have to laugh at something or you'd otherwise cry.": "Honeysuckle",
  "I find any sort of acting that doesn't have any humor in it is mind-numbingly boring.": "Andrew",
  "There is a lack of humor in fashion. To me, it's always been the fun, cool industry to work in, and I always wanted people to be on my side and see how much fun we really have behind the scenes.": "Chris",
  "Somebody says, 'Do a Tom Bodett, a folksy kind of thing,' and it sounds like something out of 'Hee Haw,' very insulting. They turn wry humor into disparaging sarcasm, and you get what amounts to insulting advertising.": "Tom",
  "'The Sopranos' is filled with really retrograde humor. Bathroom humor, falls, stupid puns, bad jokes - infantile, adolescent stuff, but it makes me laugh.": "David",
  "As I get older, my sense of humor is my biggest asset.": "David",
  "I try to find humor in everything I do, because I think all great plays - even great tragedies - have enormous humor in them.": "Marian",
  "I enjoy 'Murphy Brown,' but I am shocked that people really like 'Married... With Children.' These shows are toilet humor, and none of them have good characters.": "Jamie",
  "Humor is the secret into the audience's other ranges of emotions.": "Kevin",
  "I think bands, when they're on the road, they keep their sanity by developing an internal sense of humor.": "Ric",
  "The humor is essentially dark for a cartoon and sophisticated. But at the same time, being a cartoon gives the writers more freedom than in a normal sitcom. It always pushes the line that, despite human failings, the Simpsons are really decent people.": "Dan",
  "Guys usually like my sense of humor, and I am pretty down to earth. And I'm a driven person.": "Kreayshawn",
  "I think American guys tend to be a bit more forward, a bit more chatty and open than the Brits. The Brits seem to have a darker sense of humor, though I have met some Americans who have adopted bits of the British dry sense of humor as well.": "Hayley",
  "I think people are sexy when they have a sense of humor, when they are smart, when they have some sense of style, when they are kind, when they express their own opinions, when they are creative, when they have character.": "Suzanne",
  "I am a great believer that what makes our show different is the humor.": "Treat",
  "Being a Hot Mom means being respected as a mom and a woman. And, the key to being a Hot Mom is having a sense of humor about yourself and all the crazy situations that arise.": "Jami",
  "Sometimes I'll be sitting with my friends; I'll say something Koothrappali-esque and make a face. There is a lot of Koothrappali in me as a human being. A lot of mannerism, humor, mischievousness, my innocence. So I don't know if I bring him home so much as I bring myself to him at work.": "Kunal",
  "My platform has been to reach reluctant readers. And one of the best ways I found to motivate them is to connect them with reading that interests them, to expand the definition of reading to include humor, science fiction/fantasy, nonfiction, graphic novels, wordless books, audio books and comic books.": "Jon",
  "Without humor, I cannot go on and I doubt many of my readers would go on either. Humor is so important. I am here to have fun here with my work.": "Gary",
  "One thing my family has shown me is that having a sense of humor is everything.": "Zoey",
  "I find humor to be the most attractive characteristic, but I certainly won't cancel anything out, considering when you love someone you love someone, and sometimes you just can't explain it.": "Zoey",
  "The 'Twilight' movies are great in their own right, but they certainly don't have any sense of humor to them.": "Mark",
  "The main problem with films is that everybody always thinks of us as a violent people. We are not. We are spiritual. And when you show someone without a sense of humor or families, which is the way you usually see Indians in movies, then they are without a spiritual base and become subhuman.": "Michael",
  "When a chick has a sense of humor, there's nothing more attractive.": "Dylan",
  "I have no idea what a British sensibility or a British sense of humor is. I have no concept of what that is. I have no concept of what American sensibility is. I was born in Great Britain, but I was only there for six months, and we moved to Belgium, where I grew up.": "Frank",
  "Humor has been the balm of my life, but it's been reserved for those close to me, not part of the public Lana.": "Lana",
  "There's such a rich history in 'SNL' of political humor, and I think audience members expect that from us.": "Sasheer",
  "There are just certain things that turn my head. It may be a girl's sense of humor, it may be her wit, or her belief system; it could be a lot of different things.": "Jensen",
  "I choose my actors well and get to know the quirks of their personalities - and, most of all, I share humor with them. Then I keep my eyes open when they rehearse and perform, because you never know where the next stimulation comes from.": "George",
  "My family has been amazing, and they understand how blessed I am. They've been able to keep my sense of humor.": "Karen",
  "It's very hard to write humor.": "Mark",
  "I think great humor lies in playing the truth of a situation.": "Brendan",
  "I think great humor lies in playing the truth of a situation. I see myself as a performer and that applies to a Greek drama or a modern comedy.": "Brendan",
  "I certainly didn't say while writing 'Gossip Girl,' 'Oh this is going to be big!' It was really like, 'Oh god, everyone's gong to hate these people! They're so bratty!' But I actually think what is so appealing about them is the humor in them.": "Cecily",
  "So my humor, I'd say, comes from a mixture of lowbrow comedy shows and highbrow theater. It's an interesting mix.": "Jasper",
  "'24' is a pretty serious show - there isn't a lot of improv that is happening. Having said that, I do play around with the delivery. A lot of the humor comes from playing a character who is very furious and really up in her own brain and in a serious situation. That is humorous to me.": "Mary",
  "There are the horror fans that love the 'Evil Dead' because of the humor, but I'm sure it's not all of them. Not all horror fans love 'Evil Dead' because of the humor, at least not me.": "Fede",
  "I'm not just a big-haired redhead country singer who dresses flamboyantly, has this wicked sense of humor and wears rhinestones.": "Naomi",
  "A lot of people say, 'Hey, God doesn't have a sense of humor.' Yes, He does. God has a great sense of humor.": "Si",
  "The most terrible fear that anybody should have is not war, is not a disease, not cancer or heart problems or food poisoning - it's a man or a woman without a sense of humor.": "Jonathan",
  "We do not take humor seriously enough.": "Konrad",
  "I really wouldn't want to live in America. I found New York claustrophobic and dirty. I missed England when I was there, simple things like smells and the British sense of humor.": "Jonny",
  "I like Thomas Jefferson, though he intimidated me. I thought he would have been very tough to be around. I don't know if he had such a sense of humor.": "Maira",
  "He has such a patronizing tone and manner, and such a sarcastic sense of humor. I found him rather brutal, a kind of elegant brutality which appealed. No, I think he came pretty much off the page.": "Jeremy",
  "The script was just the best I'd read in a long time and I love the humor, which I wasn't expecting, and I like the fact that my six year old daughter can see the show without being, you know, protected from it.": "Stephen",
  "Back in 2004, Kellie Overbey handed me her play 'Girl Talk' to read. I fell in love with her brutally delicious humor and the fearlessly deft way in which she drew her characters. They jumped off the page and begged me to give them a space in which to stomp around.": "Carrie",
  "I think Damien Hirst is hilarious. And I think he's a true artist. He's not hilarious first; I think he is a real artist, and I also think he's got an amazing sense of humor.": "Jemima",
  "Although humor is present in every one of my films, it has always been used as a way to make the darker, heavier stuff in my stories more palatable. I never set out to make 'Humpday' a comedy.": "Lynn",
  "Putting a little time aside for clean fun and good humor is very necessary to relieve the tensions of our time.": "Hattie",
  "Americans are pragmatic, relatively uncomplicated, hearty and given to broad humor.": "Herb",
  "One can never speak enough of the virtues, the dangers, the power of shared laughter.": "Francoise",
  "People may think of Southern humor in terms of missing teeth and outhouse accidents, but the best of it is a rich vein running through the best of Southern literature.": "Roy",

  "Sometimes in the most tragic situation, something just profoundly funny happens.": "David",
  "Humor is a way to deal with stresses. It is a way to cope.": "John",
  "But because it was able to balance that kind of humor with a sweet story and characters you really rooted for and also got across the girls' point of view, I've heard nothing but great things from younger and older females as well.": "Jason",
  "I want everything I do to have humor in it, because it seems to me that all of life has that.": "Lawrence",
  "I think it's because it's so different and it takes risks. Plus, it's really smart humor. It gives the audience credit in terms of not needing to tell them when to laugh. I love that about the show. There's no laugh track.": "Sarah",
  "Cervantes is the most important Spanish writer. But he is not the most representative of the Spanish. His irony, his sense of humor - they are too subtle to seem Spanish.": "Antonio",
  "Humor was not important only for me, humor was important for this nation for centuries, to survive, you know.": "Milos",
  "Keep your sense of humor, my friend; if you don't have a sense of humor it just isn't funny anymore.": "Wavy",
  "The thing that makes 'Dirty Jobs' different is that it's one of the few shows that portrays work in a way that doesn't highlight the drudgery. Instead, it highlights the humor.": "Mike",
  "G.I. humor is similar to cop humor.": "Nelson",
  "A boy is naturally full of humor.": "Robert",
  "Even people that I agree with can do something that would be a target for a bit of humor.": "Jonathan",
  "But it was this tough little character part that I was playing, a very funny little guy that I invented over a weekend, because I realized I was not contributing to the humor of this thing. And I had to do something.": "Dabney",
  "All I try to do is as earnestly and as acutely as I can, conceive a character and try to portray this character just honestly. If the humor is within the absurdity and the awfulness of situations, then let it be seen that way.": "Patrick",
  "I'm interested not just in projects that I'll be starring in, but producing film and TV that's really quality and great for adults; and when I say 'great for adults,' it doesn't mean without humor, because I'm also interested in doing comedy.": "Lance",
  "As people, we're generally optimistic, no matter how disabled our lives are, and we find the humor in the darkest situations.": "John",
  "I grew up in a family that was very barbed and difficult, and there was a lot of humor. None of it was painless humor. All of it was at someone else's expense. It was kind of always about power.": "John",
  "I can't fall apart every time I mention that my mother's gone. I actually laugh about stories or things or situations. Of course there's a wound that will never be patched up, but I approach it with humor. Of course, I don't overlook it and go straight for the humor, but I think we have to have humor to move forward.": "Colman",
  "I like working on stories where I can explore the darker corners of childhood without illustrations but with humor.": "Kate",

  "Men live by intervals of reason under the sovereignty of humor and passion.": "Thomas",
  "I have been definitely influenced more by Latin American writers than by any other type of writer. They are very close in terms of voice - their humor, their fatalism, their... well, that over-used term 'magical realism.' It's a wonderful term that's just been used so much, we don't know what it means anymore.": "Jessica",
  "Humor distorts nothing, and only false gods are laughed off their earthly pedestals.": "Agnes",
  "Humor brings insight and tolerance. Irony brings a deeper and less friendly understanding.": "Agnes",
  "'Hill Street,' because of the wacky nature of many of our characters, really allowed us to indulge a kind of cheek-to-jowl juxtaposition of high drama with very low humor.": "Steven",

  "I am in the Master of Professional Writing program teaching Humor Writing, Literary and Dramatic.": "Shelley",

  "Humor is healing.": "Brad",
  "A lot of my humor centers on the act of telling jokes and I think this can prevent certain audiences from suspending their feeling of disbelief. It might piss a few people off, but I can't help it.": "Michael",
  "The quickest way to defuse fear or insecurity or anger is usually humor. I think comics figure that out quickly, and, once you figure it out, you think, 'Hey, if I can do this and get paid, that would be kind of cool.'": "Billy",
  "I love 'Dexter.' The dark sense of humor is wonderful.": "Stephen",
  "John Lennon, who was a good friend of mine, he had one of the best senses of humor of any human being. And Keith Richards, fantastic sense of humor. They were smart, sharp. They had their own thoughts on matters.": "Bobby",
  "The key to gallows humor is to make the joke, no matter how certain the gallows is.": "James",
  "In sitcoms, the women are so beautiful, understanding and well-bred. They have humor, but sort of display it with a twinkle of the eye and not a guffaw. But there's no juice in that for me.": "Bea",
  "There's public humor, and there's private humor, and they're all appropriate in their own way, and you shouldn't - just as you wouldn't have a megaphone and say certain things that you would say around your friends - things that are perfectly all right within your close social group with whom you share a certain context.": "Robert",
  "Humor levels the playing field. I understood that early on - that was something I had.": "Robert",
  "The interesting thing about humor is that in humor, you - in logic, something is A or not A. In humor, it's both A and not A.": "Robert",
  "The line between humor and bad taste is your audience, in which some people will find everything offensive, and some people will find nothing offensive, but the truth is that most humor originates in what would be called bad taste.": "Robert",
  "One question about a joke is, how well is the strangeness of the situation resolved? At 'The New Yorker', we retain a lot of incongruity, tapping the playful part of the mind - Monty Python-type stuff. We also try to use humor as a vehicle for communicating ideas. Not editorial comment, but observation.": "Robert",
  "Humor - I see it as a survival skill.": "Jill",
  "Humor is the truth wit is an exaggeration of the truth. ": "Stan",
  "Probably it is impossible for humor to be ever a revolutionary weapon. Candide can do little more than generate irony.": "Lionel",
  "I'm a great admirer of Primo Levi's work. It's always mind-boggling, the idea of how much pain people can endure and still come back from the edge with a sense of humor, with this tremendous animal desire we have to get on with life.": "Allan",
  "At NBC I wasn't really sure if the grandparents were going to get my sense of humor on a particular topic.": "Tabitha",
  "I suppose I look for humor in most situations because it humanizes things; it makes a character much more three-dimensional if there's some kind of humor. Not necessarily laugh-out-loud type of stuff, just a sense that there is a humorous edge to things. I do like that.": "Colm",
  "All the people who follow me on Twitter know my sense of humor. I sometimes forget the blogosphere will give it more weight than I intended.": "Kurt",
  "I love doing comedy. You don't get many good comedy scripts. They're rare. But, I do love playing comedy. Even in drama, I like to try to find the humor because I think it's very human.": "Colm",
  "Sense of humor is important in life, not just in clothing. How boring to live a life in beige.": "Jean",

  "I'm a novelist first, and I wrote a bunch of books, and everything I write, I just find people are more interesting when there's an element of humor to it.": "Jonathan",
  "My father was an electrical engineer who worked at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh. When I was growing up, my mother wrote humor columns for the local paper. She was the Erma Bombeck of Murrysville, Pa.": "Jason",

  "The first glass is for myself, the second for my friends, the third for good humor, and the forth for my enemies.": "William",
  "Lesbian humor isn't trying to sell anything, it doesn't have to sell out. Coming out as a lesbian onstage is still a very political act; if it weren't, more women would do it.": "Kate",
  "It is the ability to take a joke, not make one, that proves you have a sense of humor.": "Max",
  "We are, in the comics, the last frontier of good, wholesome family humor and entertainment.": "Bil",
  "A humorist is a person who feels bad, but who feels good about it.": "Don",
  "If you approach Cannes with a sense of humor, nothing is that bad. You have to take it for what it is; otherwise, it's silly.": "Mathieu",
  "Perhaps naively I thought people understand what humor was, that it was invented by the human race to cope with the dark areas of life, problems and terrors.": "Bill",
  "I like to think my sense of humor is sort of smart and dumb at the same time. I like to work on multiple levels - smart and dumb, funny and sad, profound and mundane, cynical and hopeful.": "Robert",
  "It used to take me forever to read and comprehend stuff, so I decided not to make the 'Captain Underpants' books too challenging. Don't get me wrong - the humor and ideas are often sophisticated - but the books aren't hard to read. I wanted kids who hate reading to find these books irresistible.": "Dav",
  "A good sense of humor will get you everywhere.": "Josh",
  "A strong sense of humor, a really awesome personality, and maturity is also really important in a boyfriend. I tend to only be attracted to older guys for that reason. I just love guys who have a really strong sense of who they are.": "Elizabeth",
  "Comedy has to be based on truth. You take the truth and you put a little curlicue at the end.": "Sid",
  "I think films about men are often about characters who don't want to express their feelings. You're supposed to kind of admire them for not expressing their feelings. And I feel that's a bit dull. Women's stories often have stronger emotional content, which I enjoy doing. What I really love doing is mixing that with humor.": "Nigel",
  "Hope for the best, survive the worst, find humor wherever you can.": "Claire",
  "One has to develop a sense of humor to cope.": "Diane",
  "I grew up as a very sarcastic person. I was always the class clown, and to date girls, I had to be really funny. I was really skinny growing up. I was so thin, I had to run around in the shower to get wet. That kind of thin. So I always had to rely on humor and sarcasm.": "Kurt",
  "Gags die, humor doesn't.": "Jack",
  "It never seems to occur to some people, that, like beauty, a sense of humor may sometimes be fatal.": "Edgar",
  "The sense of humor has other things to do than to make itself conspicuous in the act of laughter.": "Alice",
  "So once I thought of the villain with a sense of humor, I began to think of a name and the name \"the Joker\" immediately came to mind. There was the association with the Joker in the deck of cards, and I probably yelled literally, 'Eureka!' because I knew I had the name and the image at the same time.": "Jerry",
  "Humor is merely tragedy standing on its head with its pants torn.": "Irvin",
  "I think humor is a very serious thing. I use it as a way of weakening the reader's defenses so that I can more easily take him to something more.": "William",
  "If you look at 'The Best Man,' there's a lot of humor in that, but I never consider that movie a comedy. I felt that it was a drama with comedic elements and comedic parts to it.": "Malcolm",
  "People ask me what the most important thing to take on the race is, and I always say it's a sense of humor. If you've got nothing but a sense of humor, you will survive.": "Phil",
  "There is humor in the specter of the worst disaster in our nation's history. All I have to do is sweep away the debris of shock to find it.": "Will",
  "I value humor, kindness, and the ability to tell a good story far more than money, status, or the kind of car someone drives.": "Rebecca",
  "I need to end up with someone who is strong, intelligent, independent, someone I really admire - sensitive, sensuous, warm, a sense of humor.": "Pam",
  "Our humor turns our anger into a fine art.": "Mary",

  "Sometimes I make myself laugh, but that's because I appreciate my sense of humor.": "Regina",
  "Incongruity, they say, is one of the main ingredients of humor. Maybe it's because everybody can feel superior to me. I honestly don't know.": "Emmett",
  "One doesn't have a sense of humor. It has you.": "Larry",
  "All my jobs have been with food in one way or another since 1948. My parents were in the hotel business, and I just loved the warm hearted people who worked so hard with such good humor.": "Graham",
  "Humor is an affirmation of dignity, a declaration of man's superiority to all that befalls him.": "Romain",

  "The two most powerful warriors are patience and time.": "Leo",
  "Sometimes by losing a battle you find a new way to win the war.": "Donald",
  "We don't even know how strong we are until we are forced to bring that hidden strength forward. In times of tragedy, of war, of necessity, people do amazing things. The human capacity for survival and renewal is awesome.": "Isabel",
  "You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.": "Napoleon",
  "Know thy self, know thy enemy. A thousand battles, a thousand victories.": "Sun",
  "Even today we raise our hand against our brother... We have perfected our weapons, our conscience has fallen asleep, and we have sharpened our ideas to justify ourselves as if it were normal we continue to sow destruction, pain, death. Violence and war lead only to death.": "Pope",
  "I must study politics and war that my sons may have liberty to study mathematics and philosophy.": "John",
  "Build me a son, O Lord, who will be strong enough to know when he is weak, and brave enough to face himself when he is afraid, one who will be proud and unbending in honest defeat, and humble and gentle in victory.": "Douglas",
  "The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his.": "George",
  "A really strong woman accepts the war she went through and is ennobled by her scars.": "Carly",
  "The soldier above all others prays for peace, for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.": "Douglas",
  "Battle is the most magnificent competition in which a human being can indulge. It brings out all that is best it removes all that is base. All men are afraid in battle. The coward is the one who lets his fear overcome his sense of duty. Duty is the essence of manhood. ": "George",
  "Politics is war without bloodshed while war is politics with bloodshed.": "Mao",
  "War is never a lasting solution for any problem.": "A.",
  "To be prepared for war is one of the most effective means of preserving peace.": "George",
  "Victorious warriors win first and then go to war, while defeated warriors go to war first and then seek to win.": "Sun",
  "The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy's not coming, but on our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the fact that we have made our position unassailable.": "Sun",
  "Mankind must put an end to war before war puts an end to mankind.": "John",
  "No event in American history is more misunderstood than the Vietnam War. It was misreported then, and it is misremembered now.": "Richard",
  "Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die.": "Herbert",
  "The Cold War isn't thawing; it is burning with a deadly heat. Communism isn't sleeping; it is, as always, plotting, scheming, working, fighting.": "Richard",
  "Thus, what is of supreme importance in war is to attack the enemy's strategy.": "Sun",
  "During the time men live without a common power to keep them all in awe, they are in that conditions called war; and such a war, as if of every man, against every man.": "Thomas",
  "It was my duty to shoot the enemy, and I don't regret it. My regrets are for the people I couldn't save: Marines, soldiers, buddies. I'm not naive, and I don't romanticize war. The worst moments of my life have come as a SEAL. But I can stand before God with a clear conscience about doing my job.": "Chris",
  "European nations began World War I with a glamorous vision of war, only to be psychologically shattered by the realities of the trenches. The experience changed the way people referred to the glamour of battle; they treated it no longer as a positive quality but as a dangerous illusion.": "Virginia",
  "The condition of man... is a condition of war of everyone against everyone.": "Thomas",
  "In an era in which war and terrorism - at home and abroad - are often based on racial, religious and ethnic differences, rediscovering the wisdom of love and compassion may help us increase our survival at a time when an increasingly divided country and world so badly need it.": "Dean",
  "I joined the army on my seventeenth birthday, full of the romance of war after having read a lot of World War I British poetry and having seen a lot of post-World War II films. I thought the romantic presentations of war influenced my joining and my presentation of war to my younger siblings.": "Walter",

  "Quickness is the essence of the war.": "Sun",
  "I am tired and sick of war. Its glory is all moonshine. It is only those who have neither fired a shot nor heard the shrieks and groans of the wounded who cry aloud for blood, for vengeance, for desolation. War is hell.": "William",
  "The lesson of the Cold War is that against nuclear weapons, only nuclear weapons can hold the peace.": "Chung",
  "The more you sweat in peace, the less you bleed in war.": "Norman",

  "What a cruel thing war is... to fill our hearts with hatred instead of love for our neighbors.": "Robert",
  "My father was very disappointed by war and fighting. And he thought language could help us out of cycles of revenge and animosity. And so, as a journalist, he always found himself asking lots of questions and trying to gather information. He was always very clear to underscore the fact that Jewish people and Arab people were brother and sister.": "Naomi",
  "There is no avoiding war it can only be postponed to the advantage of others. ": "Niccolo",
  "World War I was not inevitable, as many historians say. It could have been avoided, and it was a diplomatically botched negotiation.": "Richard",

  "Our Generation has had no Great war, no Great Depression. Our war is spiritual. Our depression is our lives.": "Chuck",

  "Communism has never come to power in a country that was not disrupted by war or corruption, or both.": "John",

  "Ten soldiers wisely led will beat a hundred without a head.": "Euripides",
  "When we are sick, we want an uncommon doctor; when we have a construction job to do, we want an uncommon engineer, and when we are at war, we want an uncommon general. It is only when we get into politics that we are satisfied with the common man.": "Herbert",
  "The great questions of the day will not be settled by means of speeches and majority decisions but by iron and blood.": "Otto",
  "A quality education grants us the ability to fight the war on ignorance and poverty.": "Charles",
  "There are two problems for our species' survival - nuclear war and environmental catastrophe - and we're hurtling towards them. Knowingly.": "Noam",
  "I had a very strong feeling about the Vietnam War, and I had a strong feeling about participating in it. The military draft was in place, I was summoned for a physical exam, and I was either going to be classified as fit for military service or make my objection to it. So I made my objection to it.": "Harrison",
  "I'm a Canadian. Outside Canada I carry the flag. Canadian nationalism isn't as insidious as American nationalism, though. It's good natured. It's all about maple syrup, not war.": "Feist",
  "As a soldier, I survived World War I when most of my comrades did not.": "Lester",
  "Great is the guilt of an unnecessary war.": "John",
  "The United Nations' founders understood that decisions affecting war and peace should happen only by consensus, and with America's consent, the veto by Security Council permanent members was enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The profound wisdom of this has underpinned the stability of international relations for decades.": "Vladimir",
  "I covered the Vietnam War. I remember the lies that were told, the lives that were lost - and the shock when, twenty years after the war ended, former Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara admitted he knew it was a mistake all along.": "Walter",
  "This union has been divided in like a civil war - brother against brother - sister against sister. And I'm pulling it together. We've already seen evidence of that in New York, in Pennsylvania, in California. The first thing is we have to get on the same page. We have to be united in one cause.": "James",
  "Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence. In other words, it is war minus the shooting.": "George",

  "The day that the balance between the two sections of the country - the slaveholding States and the non-slaveholding States - is destroyed is a day that will not be far removed from political revolution, anarchy, civil war, and widespread disaster.": "John",
  "There is always inequality in life. Some men are killed in a war and some men are wounded and some men never leave the country. Life is unfair.": "John",
  "Empathy is really the opposite of spiritual meanness. It's the capacity to understand that every war is both won and lost. And that someone else's pain is as meaningful as your own.": "Barbara",
  "World War I broke out largely because of an arms race, and World War II because of the lack of an arms race.": "Herman",
  "If men can develop weapons that are so terrifying as to make the thought of global war include almost a sentence for suicide, you would think that man's intelligence and his comprehension... would include also his ability to find a peaceful solution.": "Dwight",

  "War is not only a matter of equipment, artillery, group troops or air force; it is largely a matter of spirit, or morale.": "Chiang",
  "When I see the Confederate flag, I see the attempt to raise an empire in slavery. It really, really is that simple. I don't understand how anybody with any sort of education on the Civil War can see anything else.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "For me, true beauty has nothing to do with wrinkles and everything to do with the fact that my maternal grandmother raised five children just after the war and remained a fighter throughout her life. True beauty is the slick of red lipstick my paternal grandmother would put on before going to church on Sunday.": "Monica",

  "In war, events of importance are the result of trivial causes.": "Julius",
  "We have but one flag, one country; let us stand together. We may differ in color, but not in sentiment. Many things have been said about me which are wrong, and which white and black persons here, who stood by me through the war, can contradict.": "Nathan",
  "Life on Earth is at the ever-increasing risk of being wiped out by a disaster, such as sudden global nuclear war, a genetically engineered virus or other dangers we have not yet thought of.": "Stephen",
  "The art of war is of vital importance to the state. It is a matter of life and death, a road either to safety or to ruin. Hence it is a subject of inquiry which can on no account be neglected.": "Sun",
  "The negative effects of combat were nightmares, and I'd get jumpy around certain noises and stuff, but you'd have that after a car accident or a bad divorce. Life's filled with trauma. You don't need to go to war to find it; it's going to find you. We all deal with it, and the effects go away after awhile. At least they did for me.": "Sebastian",
  "In war, whichever side may call itself the victor, there are no winners, but all are losers.": "Neville",
  "From the neck up is where you win or lose the battle. It's the art of war. You have to lock yourself in and strategise your mindset. That's why boxers go to training camps: to shut down the noise and really zone in.": "Anthony",

  "Like Nemesis of Greek tragedy, the central problem of America after the Civil War, as before, was the black man: those four million souls whom the nation had used and degraded, and on whom the South had built an oligarchy similar to the colonial imperialism of today, erected on cheap colored labor and raising raw material for manufacture.": "W.",

  "War is the continuation of politics by other means.": "Carl",
  "Germany was beaten after World War I, but it didn't take long for it to rise again as a much more malignant threat. The end of World War II was not to be a compromise; it was to come about from the total annihilation of the enemies' ability and will to make war.": "Monica",

  "It is good that war is so horrible, or we might grow to like it.": "Robert",
  "It just seems to me that the world's kind of a mess, and the more messy it gets, the more interested I am in escapist fare.

  "We've persevered because of a belief we share with the Iraqi people - a belief that out of the ashes of war, a new beginning could be born in this cradle of civilization.

  "One of the lessons learned during the Vietnam War was that the depiction of wounded soldiers, of coffins stacked higher than their living guards, had a negative effect on the viewing public. The military in Iraq specifically banned the photographing of wounded soldiers and coffins, thus sanitizing this terrible and bloody conflict.": "Walter",
  "No one has the right to ignite a war and lead an occupation and armies to conquer people, invading them and make them suffer all kinds of torture, murder, expulsion, displacement, bombing and terrorism by different lethal prohibited weapons and then come and speak as the savior of the people or a defender of their rights.": "Muqtada",
  "In time of war, truth is always replaced by propaganda.": "Charles",

  "Let us wage a moral and political war against the billionaires and corporate leaders, on Wall Street and elsewhere, whose policies and greed are destroying the middle class of America.": "Bernie",

  "The threat today is not that of the 1930s. It's not big powers going to war with each other. The ravages which fundamentalist political ideology inflicted on the 20th century are memories. The Cold war is over. Europe is at peace, if not always diplomatically.": "Tony",
  "My father wanted to be a hero. He went to the Air Force Academy, was valedictorian, and then he found himself strafing villagers in Vietnam in a war he didn't want to be in and didn't understand. He was extremely conflicted about the line where he went from being the good guy to possibly being the bad guy.": "Patty",

  "I'm finding myself really angry over spending and the deficit. I'm finding myself really angry over what's happening in the Middle East, the decision to stay in Afghanistan indefinitely. I'm angry about cap and trade. And I've been on record for a long time on the failed war on drugs.": "Gary",
  "I grew up on what everybody called a plantation - but believe me, it wasn't a plantation. It was just an old farm. I grew up with a lot of black people working in the fields, and it was during the Depression between 1930 and the war, so we were all poor - black and white.": "Sam",

  "My home policy: I wage war my foreign policy: I wage war. All the time I wage war. ": "Georges",
  "I always found the extraordinary loss of life in the First World War very moving.

Every year the teachers would suddenly wear these red paper flowers in their lapels, and I would say 'What does that mean?'": "Tom",
  "Wanton killing of innocent civilians is terrorism, not a war against terrorism.": "Noam",
  "War is a racket. It always has been... A few profit - and the many pay. But there is a way to stop it. You can't end it by disarmament conferences. You can't eliminate it by peace parleys at Geneva. Well-meaning but impractical groups can't wipe it out by resolutions. It can be smashed effectively only by taking the profit out of war.": "Smedley",

  "Those who are at war with others are not at peace with themselves.": "William",

  "War is a form of really bad manners, in a strange way. Invading a country I think is just the worst possible manners. 'You're not invited!' Gate crashing on a large scale!": "Graydon",

  "One culture I find fascinating to juxtapose against American culture is the culture of Germany. They've gone through a long process through their art, poetry, public discourse, their politics, of owning the fact of their complicity in what happened in World War II. It's still a topic of everyday conversation in Germany.": "Chris",

  "Ants are so much like human beings as to be an embarrassment. They farm fungi, raise aphids as livestock, launch armies into war, use chemical sprays to alarm and confuse enemies, capture slaves, engage in child labour, exchange information ceaselessly. They do everything but watch television.": "Lewis",
  "Construction of the first gas pipeline system was started during the 1960s, at the height of the Cold War, and for all those years, from the 1960s until this day, Russia has been fulfilling its contract obligations in a very consistent and reliable way, regardless of the political situation.": "Vladimir",

  "Those who remember Washington's cold war culture in the 1980s will recall the shocked reactions to Reagan's intervention.

  "Capitalism is war socialism is peace. ": "Karl",
  "To secure peace is to prepare for war.": "Carl",

  "Cyber war takes place largely in secret, unknown to the general public on both sides.": "Noah",

  "I come from - I came from Wales, and it's a strong, butch society. We were in the war and all that. People didn't waste time feeling sorry for themselves. You had to get on with it.

  "The war on drugs is not being won, and it continues to threaten stability and democracy not only in the Andes but throughout the Caribbean as well, where tiny police and military forces are outclassed by the sophisticated equipment in the hands of traffickers passing through the region on the way to their market in this country.": "Elliott",
  "If you walk into the front hallway of the CIA, you will see, on your left, a statue of William 'Wild Bill' Donovan.

  "I think that you can honour the sacrifices of a common soldier without glorifying war.": "Geraldine",
  "There was a belief after World War I that painting could be an act of civil revolt. I want this exhibition, 'New Museum,' to be an act of civil disobedience. It's not so much about the New Museum on the Bowery, but the idea of challenging museums as projections of cultural authority. It's painting as insurgency.": "Richard",
  "As history has repeatedly proven, one trade tariff begets another, then another - until you've got a full-blown trade war. No one ever wins, and consumers always get screwed.": "Mark",

  "Science fiction has always been a means for political comment. H.G. Wells' 'The War of the Worlds' wasn't about a Martian invasion - it was a critique of British colonialism, and... 'The Time Machine' is really an indictment of the British class system.": "Robert",
  "I know war as few other men now living know it, and nothing to me is more revolting. I have long advocated its complete abolition, as its very destructiveness on both friend and foe has rendered it useless as a method of settling international disputes.": "Ernest",

  "If it's just screaming - and I know this sounds so ridiculous - that gets old. But sometimes when there's literal chaos, it's like being in a war zone, and that's kind of exciting. You're just running through the crowd of people chasing after you and no one knows what's going on.": "Robert",
  "But do I think that our actions in anyway violate the War Powers Resolution, the answer is no.": "Barack",

  "Let's face it - think of Africa, and the first images that come to mind are of war, poverty, famine and flies. How many of us really know anything at all about the truly great ancient African civilizations, which in their day, were just as splendid and glorious as any on the face of the earth?": "Henry",

  "See, the 'On the Road' that came out in 1957 was censored. A lot of the honesty of it, the bitter honesty, is in the original scroll version that came out in 2007 on the 50-year anniversary.

  "The reality is gas prices should be much more expensive then they are because we're not incorporating the true damage to the environment and the hidden costs of mining oil and transporting it to the U.S. Whenever you have an unpriced externality, you have a bit of a market failure, to the degree that eternality remains unpriced.": "Elon",

  "My dad encouraged us to fail. Growing up, he would ask us what we failed at that week. If we didn't have something, he would be disappointed. It changed my mindset at an early age that failure is not the outcome, failure is not trying. Don't be afraid to fail.": "Sara",
  "There's something to be said for failing. It's not the failure you feel, it's the failure that people project when something disappoints. You're back to ground zero, where there's no expectations, and that's where I like to be.": "Kevin",
  "The vast majority of large scale change efforts fail. Which means that the probability that you have actually experienced a failure, and your people know that and are pessimistic, therefore, about trying something again, is very high.": "John",

  "Honesty is about the scars. It's about the blemishes. But it's more than just bragging about failure, which could be a form of ego. It's about truly helping people.": "James",
  "Good fiction is about asserting the beauties of the world, inventing a new, positive thing. Where am I going to get that? And it should be original; it should not be cliched. So the way I looked at history was not to accuse it of failure.": "Orhan",

  "Performers should really go to the best schools, like Lady Gaga, you know, she went to NYU and had great teachers... It's best to really study your technique as much as you possibly can so you can have a long career instead of a quick one that's a failure.": "Tony",
  "The woman is a gentle, loving bond who encourages, consoles, builds, reconciles, and makes all things new and vibrant. The woman is strength in time of suffering, courageous in failure, intuitive in time of danger.

  "I was very afraid of failure because if you fail at something you love, then you ruin what you love.": "Kimbal",

  "I fear that our true motivation is about oil and our own flailing economy about the failure to destroy Al Qaeda and about revenge. ": "Dave",

  "The study of literature threatens to become a kind of paleontology of failure, and criticism a supercilious psychoanalysis of authors.": "John",
  "I was taught you don't tell your secrets to strangers - certainly not secrets that expose error, weakness, failure. My generation, like its predecessors, was taught that since our achievements received little notice or credit from white America, we were not to discuss our faults, lapses, or uncertainties in public.": "Margo",
  "When you say 'failure,' that seems really dramatic, but a lot of failure is just really depressing and mundane. I remember the first time I ever played a concert in Italy. I played a venue that held 900 people, and I think five people showed up. It wasn't a big, 'John Carter of Mars' type failure. It wasn't dramatic; it was just depressing.": "Moby",

  "Sociologists well understand that chaos at home causes violent behavior, educational failure and social alienation among children. Yet, many of us in America stay far, far away from this topic. That in itself is a national scandal. Bad parenting is gravely harming this nation.": "Bill",
  "Before I was married, I didn't consider my failure to manage even basic hand tools a feminist inadequacy. I thought it had more to do with being Jewish. The Jews I knew growing up didn't do 'do-it-yourself.'

  "As an outside; don't worry about failure, because failure will take care of itself. Focus on success.": "Henry",

  "Philanthropic colonization is a failure. National colonization will succeed.": "Theodor",
  "Cheerfully fessing up to our failures turns crazy mind off, humility and compassion on. I learned this in a karate dojo that had a strange tradition. Everyone there loved recounting failure stories, and after an evening of smacking one another, we'd sit and have a beer while the students swapped tales of martial arts disaster.": "Martha",

  "When we talk about 9/11 and 26/11 - which is the shorthand for the Mumbai attacks in 2008 - we're talking about the most successful terrorist attacks in history. When you start trying to study the most successful event of its kind, it actually doesn't make for great fiction because there isn't the kind of failure in it that fiction thrives on.": "Karan",

  "We dissect failure a lot more than we dissect success.": "Matthew",

  "To err is human, but it feels divine.": "Mae",
  "The only risk of failure is promotion.": "Scott",
  "The threat posed by Bank of America isn't just financial - it's a full-blown assault on the American dream.

If this is what winning in our system looks like, who doesn't want to be a loser?": "Matt",

  "Education is the only billion dollar industry that tolerates abject failure.": "Geoffrey",

  "Failure and its accompanying misery is for the artist his most vital source of creative energy.": "Montgomery",

  "'Pressure' is a word that is misused in our vocabulary. When you start thinking of pressure, it's because you've started to think of failure.": "Tommy",
  "Successful entrepreneurs find the balance between listening to their inner voice and staying persistent in driving for success - because sometimes success is waiting right across from the transitional bump that's disguised as failure.": "Naveen",

  "Don't be afraid of failure be afraid of petty success. ": "Maude",
  "Failure is always an option.": "Adam",
  "We're born with success. It is only others who point out our failures, and what they attribute to us as failure.": "Whoopi",
  "Failure saves lives. In the airline industry, every time a plane crashes the probability of the next crash is lowered by that. The Titanic saved lives because we're building bigger and bigger ships. So these people died, but we have effectively improved the safety of the system, and nothing failed in vain.": "Nassim",
  "You look at any culture, and prohibition has invariably been an unmitigated failure. It is just idiotic to criminalise any substance, I think.": "Rhys",
  "The line between failure and success is so fine that we scarcely know when we pass it: so fine that we are often on the line and do not know it.": "Elbert",

  "The lessons I learned from my mother and her friends have guided me through death, birth, loss, love, failure, and achievement, on to a Fulbright scholarship and Harvard Business School. They taught me to believe that anything was possible. They have proven to be the strongest family values I could ever have imagined.": "Gayle",
  "Comedy was my sport. It taught me how to roll with the punches. Failure is the exact same as success when it comes to comedy because it just keeps coming. It never stops.": "Emma",
  "Be greedy for social change, and your life will be endlessly enriched. The only failure lies in not trying, or giving up.": "Ann",

  "If China stood on an equal basis with other nations, she could compete freely with them in the economic field and be able to hold her own without failure. But as soon as foreign nations use political power as a shield for their economic designs, then China is at a loss how to resist or to compete successfully with them.": "Sun",
  "Writing is harder than acting. I enjoy acting for just the brevity with which you can be in the experience of doing it.

At best, it creates a hypercompetitive culture, and at worst, it sends students the message that the world is a zero-sum game: Your success means my failure.": "Adam",
  "My work ethic came from my parents and my fear of failure. I came from a small, predominantly black school and I didn't want to let them down.": "Jerry",

  "By far the most important factor in the success or failure of any school, far more important than tests or standards or business-model methods of accountability, is simply attracting the best-educated, most exciting young people into urban schools and keeping them there.": "Jonathan",
  "A fictionalised memoir of my father would be a failure as a novel.": "Richard",
  "While it's important to accept failure and not let it bog you down, it's also perfectly acceptable to get upset about it as long as you remember that failure is a stepping stone in your journey that is getting you to where you need to be.": "John",
  "We've all experienced those days when we feel like an absolute failure. It's a normal feeling when things don't go as exactly planned. And, when we feel like that, it's challenging to think of yourself as a successful individual.": "John",
  "We decided to try in vitro, because both Peter and I felt we couldn't handle another failure. When I miscarried after that, we had to come to terms with the possibility that this wasn't meant to be.": "Christie",
  "The greatest challenge to most innovation centers around the world is many nations' punitive attitudes towards failure. In most of the world, if your first business fails, no one will work with you again. But, trial and error is the genesis of innovation.": "Jay",
  "Success and failure are equally surprising.": "Daryl",
  "The Tea Party people say they're angry about socialism, but maybe they're really angry about capitalism. If there's a sense of being looked down upon, it's that sense of failure that's built into a system that assures everyone they can make it to the top, but then reserves the top for only a tiny fraction of the strivers.": "Gail",
  "The failure to work out sensible budgets makes it impossible for government agencies to make long-term plans, and instead leaves them scrambling to spend money in the short term.": "Matt",
  "I felt like a failure for so long because I wasn't able to access myself in the way I knew I would have if I was going to make music that mattered. I knew I was going to have to learn how to be honest.": "John",
  "The failure of one regional bank, assuming it is following a traditional model, will not threaten the entire system.": "Sherrod",
  "I think there is a failure in foreign policy. And you have to acknowledge that under Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton was the architect of that foreign policy. Whether it was malevolent or not, I don't know.": "Mike",
  "Movies are not novels, and that's why, when filmmakers try to adapt novels, particularly long or complex novels, the result is almost always failure. It can't be done.": "Paul",
  "There's no question that Kennedy was an utter failure as a passer of laws during his proverbial thousand days.": "Rick",
  "I wanted to give an honest insight into a consuming Tour. It's turned out pretty interesting because there aren't many books out there documenting someone's failure.": "Bradley",

  "I didn't allow failure to break my heart. So I wouldn't allow success to bloat my head.": "Randeep",
  "I didn't fear failure. I expected failure.": "Amy",
  "I think I've always been somebody, since the deaths of my father and brother, who was afraid to hope. So, I was more prepared for failure and for rejection than for success.": "Amy",
  "If it's a good work of adaptation, the book should remain a book and the film should remain a film, and you should not necessarily read the book to see the film. If you do need that, then that means that it's a failure. That is what I think.": "Marjane",
  "I've loved every minute I've spent in television. And I've had much more failure, as traditionally measured, than success in television. I've done four shows, and only one of them was the 'West Wing.'": "Aaron",
  "Failure to curb temperature increases will impact all countries, Ireland included, but with the most immediate and drastic effects being felt, in many instances, by the most vulnerable countries and communities.": "Enda",
  "I like Diaspora because it's audacious, it's driven by passion, and it's very, very hard to do. After all, who in their right mind would set as a goal taking on Facebook? That's sort of like deciding to build a better search engine - very expensive, with a high likelihood of failure.": "John",
  "The failure of the White House and Congress to seriously address the nation's fiscal situation is certain to broaden the belief among many voters that the U.S. political system is broken.": "Ron",
  "Lincoln made mistakes. Roosevelt made mistakes. Eisenhower made mistakes. The Battle of the Bulge was the biggest intelligence failure in American military history, much bigger than any in Vietnam or now. We didn't know that the Soviets were moving 400,000 or 500,000 troops. We missed it.": "Rudy",
  "My greatest sense of accomplishment has come from having two amazing sons, but it's also a paradox in that the times when I felt like the biggest failure have been times when I felt like, as a parent, I wasn't making the right decisions or succeeding in the way that I should.": "Michael",
  "Well, I think it's too early to call Fallujah a failure.": "Chuck",

  "If we don't succeed, we run the risk of failure.": "Al",
  "I teach students that what people say about failure in politics is mostly wrong. People always told me, 'They'll praise you on your way up and kick you on your way down.' That wasn't my experience. I can't walk down the street in Toronto without someone coming up and saying hello.": "Michael",
  "In 1999, I was in St. Louis with Martin Luther King III as we led protests against the state's failure to hire minority contractors for highway construction projects. We went at dawn on a summer day with over a thousand people and performed acts of civil disobedience.": "Al",

  "Coming to terms with the fact that my marriage was a failure was devastating and very difficult.": "Sarah",

  "The historic lesson is that it was a strategic failure to go into Iraq. History will not be and should not be kind with that decision.": "Michael",
  "I can plunk out enough chords to write a song, but I'm completely afraid to play guitar in front of other people. It's a fear of failure, I guess.": "Mandy",
  "Overhead will eat you alive if not constantly viewed as a parasite to be exterminated. Never mind the bleating of those you employ. Hold out until mutiny is imminent before employing even a single additional member of staff. More startups are wrecked by overstaffing than by any other cause, bar failure to monitor cash flow.": "Felix",
  "I lived with this tremendous fear of failure because my father was a playwright and a director, and I think he did a couple of things as a child as an actor as well, and he... he failed, basically.": "Ben",
  "My failure to lay aside the sin that so easily entangles is the direct result of my refusal to die to my natural proclivity toward attaining my own freedom, meaning, value, worth, and righteousness - not believing that, by virtue of my Spirit - wrought union with Christ, everything I need, I already possess.": "Tullian",
  "What is indisputable is the fact that unbelief is the force that gives birth to all of our bad behavior and every moral failure. It is the root.": "Tullian",

  "When people read 'Breitbart' every single day and convince themselves that Barack Obama is a foreign terrorist, that is not a problem of government. That is a problem of community failure, and we have to recognize that.": "J.",
  "Trump's biggest failure as a political leader is that he sees the worst in people, and he encourages the worst in people.": "J.",
  "In Chicago, you have an absence of strong family units, and that absence gets filled by gangs.

  "Failure is enriching. It's also important to accept that you'll make mistakes - it's how you build your expertise. The trick is to learn a positive lesson from all of life's negative moments.": "Alain",

  "Different parts of the world have different attitudes to failure. Arguably, it may take more courage to be an entrepreneur in Sydney, or Paris, or London, or Japan, or Singapore... but an entrepreneur sees the world for what it could be, not what it is.": "Guy",
  "No one suggested Lehman deserved to be saved. But the argument has been made that the crisis might have been less severe if it had been saved, because Lehman's failure created remarkable uncertainty in the market as investors became confused about the role of the government and whether it was picking winners and losers.": "Andrew",
  "In truth, in the fairy-tale version of bailing out Lehman, the next domino, A.I.G., would have fallen even harder. If the politics of bailing out Lehman were bad, the politics of bailing out A.I.G. would have been worse. And the systemic risk that a failure of A.I.G. posed was orders of magnitude greater than Lehman's collapse.": "Andrew",
  "The failure of Lehman may have allowed the government to do more to prop up the economy than it otherwise could.": "Andrew",
  "I think, with Hank Paulson, the concept of a bailout was anathema to him from day one. He was a Republican; he's a free marketeer. He believes in capitalism, and part of capitalism is believing in failure. And so the idea of bailing out an institution, I think, went against every part of him.": "Andrew",
  "I think to visualize failure as you're starting off is really a bad thing to do.": "Marcia",

  "The traditional religious right's failure to restore public-school prayer or pass an antiabortion constitutional amendment has likely helped fuel the spread of the more extreme dominionist school.": "Jon",
  "I buy a lot of cookbooks. Some of them you just kind of read, and you try one recipe, and it doesn't really work. So then you don't go back to it. The new Ina Garten cookbook, which is called 'Back to Basics,' I have not had a failure with. It is the most fantastic cookbook. I think I bought 20 copies of it for friends.": "Nora",
  "I see disappointment as something small and aggregate rather than something unified or great. With a little effort, every failure can be turned into something good.": "Eleanor",
  "Being a pathfinder is to be willing to risk failure and still go on.": "Gail",
  "Most people don't really do too many things because they're afraid they'll fail. There are people failing all the time, all around you. And nobody is going to notice your failure. Your failure is not going to be so spectacular that people write news stories about it. Your failure will be boring.": "Kumail",
  "There is no middle ground in Hollywood you're a failure or you're a success. That mentality is wild. ": "Javier",
  "I guess it's the fear of failure and not knowing how the films are going to do that just drives us to work really hard to make them the best they can possibly be.": "Lee",
  "Men are taught that if we are not the ultimate provider, we are a complete failure. We have to be number one in everything we do. There is nothing more delusional or paralysing than what I have just described.": "Edgar",
  "I feel like if we can use the combination of basically data-driven hunches and bet on really first-class talent to deliver the shows, that I think we could do as well as the networks do, who basically have a 75 to 80 percent failure rate for new shows anyway - even after all that development and pilot work.": "Ted",
  "The power of fear of failure, with will to win, is an incredible force. I don't think we should be worried about having a fear of failure; I think it's quite natural. If you surveyed any top businessman or any top athlete, I bet if they were truthful, they would all say they've got a fear of losing and a fear of failure.": "John",
  "I think I'm less afraid of failure than some others.": "Russell",
  "People are afraid of failure - they don't like to work so hard and have people keep saying, 'No.' I think that's what people fear most.": "Russell",
  "When I was an adolescent in England, at school we had to read 'Death of a Salesman.' I remember feeling incredibly moved by the portrayal of these people and the idea with which Miller broached the whole subject of failure or failed systems, or the way that people are crushed by a system in which they find themselves.": "Simon",
  "Revolutionaries were depressed and close to emotional breakdown; after the failure, they left successively.": "Sun",
  "I think, in storytelling, people want to see triumph, and so it's usually nice to start with failure and see someone somehow rise above it. People like to see people try. And they like to see people fail for comedy, and they like to see people succeed for the drama and emotion.": "Nick",
  "I don't know if it's a failure of imagination on my part, but I'm not going to be writing about Paris in the 1800s. I feel like it would come off as just ludicrously uninformed, even if I did a lot of research.": "Maria",
  "I think if you just eat healthy, you're active, and you don't beat yourself up, you're setting yourself up to win rather than setting yourself up for failure.": "Kristin",
  "In Torch Song, I did that character almost non-stop from 1978 until I made the movie in 1987. Then I had some failure, which also colors how you react to doing other things.": "Harvey",
  "All the world loves a good loser.": "Kin",
  "It's not that we fly by the seat of our pants. We're not afraid of failure.": "Craig",
  "Failure worries me; nobody wants to fail. There is a fear that one day, films will not come my way, or if someone doesn't watch your film, that is a worrying point. It is unpredictable in the industry.": "Alia",
  "I have my way of dealing with lows in my career: I just go on a holiday. Coping with a failure of a film is like coping with a break-up. It's sad and heart-breaking, and it's not like I got over it right after my holiday; it took me some time.": "Alia",
  "You'll never convince me there is a hopeless situation or there is any finality in any success or any failure.": "Carlos",
  "In politics, what begins in fear usually ends in failure.": "Samuel",
  "Bare hands grip success better than kid gloves. Be thorough in all things, no matter how small or distasteful! The man who counts his hours and kicks about his salary is a self-elected failure.": "Charles",
  "I don't know which is stronger: the thrill of winning or the fear of failure. I don't know which one affects me most. I don't know where the middle is.": "Tony",
  "I think I've failed every test I've ever taken. If there was a failure I would have been it.": "Lisa",
  "From a public perspective, the Grand National is the biggest race of all, and not to have won it yet is definitely a failure. But there's been a lot of jockeys every bit as good and better than me that haven't won it - John Francome, Peter Scudamore, Jonjo O'Neill, Charlie Swan, to name a few.": "Tony",
  "What is more comforting to the terrorists around the world: the failure to pass the 9/11 legislation because we lacked a majority of the majority,' or putting aside partisan politics to enact tough new legislation with America's security foremost in mind?": "Rahm",
  "When you can look at failure and say, 'What is the worst case scenario,' it's not as bad as it seems.": "Whitney",
  "Failure's a marker of success in its own right because you went out and tried something... If you really don't want to fail, go find a comfortable chair and stay there. Just don't go out and do anything.": "Whitney",
  "If you truly want to find a meaningful relationship, you've got to find yourself first and learn to be confident in your own skin. Don't sacrifice anything about who you are to be with someone. That's setting yourself up for failure.": "Whitney",
  "The failure of the system to deal quickly was attributable to Nixon's lying, stonewalling and refusal to come clean. So it took 26 months for the final truth to be known.": "Bob",
  "One of my most vivid memories from 1974 was the gas station at the foot of the hill below my Southern California high school - car lines snaking out into the street, heralding the failure of the government's price controls and lame ideas such as odd-even rationing.": "Nina",
  "When you come off 'The X Factor,' you're more likely to be a failure than a success because people almost want you to fail. There's this kind of feeling that you're separate from everyone else. You get it from artists, people in the industry, people at record labels.": "Olly",
  "I find writing very difficult. It's hard and it hurts sometimes, and it's scary because of the fear of failure and the very unpleasant feeling that you may have reached the limit of your abilities.": "Tony",
  "Whenever a chef cooks for his own ego rather than his guests, he/she set themselves up for ridicule and failure. In the end, it's the service industry. Our goal is to make our guests happy through our cooking.": "Johnny",
  "Every time you go out there to do something, you wonder if you can do it. There's no assured success. There's no secret recipe for success. Every time you go out there, you go out there with the possibility of great failure.": "Mel",
  "Failure to pass TPP sends a big signal. The United States is backing off, backing away. That will create a huge void here.": "Max",
  "Admitting failure is quite cleansing, but never - pleasurable.": "Michael",
  "I would have thought that I would have become one of those parents - just because it's my nature to be such a perfectionist - that anything falling short, I would have seen as a failure. But something has happened to me over the past few years - it's not Zen, believe me, I'm not at all Zen - but I'm so appreciative of even the chaos.": "Brooke",

  "That sense of failure, I don't know where people put it who don't write songs and aren't able to emote physically. It must go somewhere.": "Sting",
  "Every American president must be held to the highest standard. No president of any color should be given a free pass for screw-ups, lies or failure to keep a promise.": "Juan",
  "To me, the failure of liberalism - the tradition I come from - was not recognizing there has to be justice across the generations.": "Richard",
  "A hatred of failure has always been part of my nature.": "J.",
  "So much has changed in our business. E-books, that's been one of the principal developments. There has been also the failure of Borders and the rise of Amazon, just to name two others.": "Sonny",
  "No matter how well things are going, failure and disaster are just around the corner. So celebrate the good, but be ready for the bad.": "Vivek",
  "I have always been pushed by the negative. The apparent failure of a play sends me back to my typewriter that very night, before the reviews are out. I am more compelled to get back to work than if I had a success.": "Tennessee",
  "I'm fully aware that things that resonate and become real hits are the exception to the rule, so much so that I've wired myself for failure.": "Ron",

  "Success is boring... failure is exciting and more entertaining.": "Anupam",
  "I don't think there's any way it could have failed. We don't know failure in this band. We didn't know failure. We got to know it a little after awhile but at that time there was no such word.": "Roger",
  "For market discipline to constrain risk effectively, financial institutions must be allowed to fail. Under optimal financial regulatory and financial system infrastructures, such a failure would not threaten the overall system.": "Henry",

  "Any attempt to list the ten best science fiction novels is doomed to failure.": "Ann",
  "War is something Arafat sends others to do for him. That is, the poor souls who believe in him. This pompous incompetent caused the failure of the Camp David negotiations, Clinton's mediation.": "Oriana",

  "Pure unadulterated success is not as funny as failure.": "Will",
  "I looked long and carefully at the picture of a stag painted by Landseer - the style was good, and the brush was handled with fine effect; but he fails in copying Nature, without which the best work will be a failure.": "John",

  "International aid as a means of development is a major failure, and not just in Haiti.": "Raoul",

  "But while success and failure depend on conditions, the mind neither waxes nor wanes.": "Bodhidharma",
  "Those on the downside of rising economic inequality generally do not want government policies that look like handouts. They typically do not want the government to make the tax system more progressive, to impose punishing taxes on the rich, in order to give the money to them. Redistribution feels demeaning. It feels like being labeled a failure.": "Robert",
  "Radical common sense is the wisdom gleaned from the past that recognizes the perishable opportunities of the moment. It is the willingness to admit error and the refusal to be deterred by failure.": "Marilyn",

  "I can't say I'm not grateful to have journalists writing about me as a genius. But I know it's not true. I'm not confused.

  "Start-ups make so many mistakes that the challenge to identify the root cause of a failure is tough. But believing in your own plan is probably the worst.": "Eric",

  "I'm full of self-doubt. I doubt everything I do. Everything I do is a failure.": "John",
  "In the old days, variety turns like me learned how to cope with failure - we all had nights when we 'died' on stage - but today's youngsters simply don't have that experience. For them, it really is instant make or break time - hence, all the tears and, hence, all the potential emotional damage.": "Bruce",

  "I was never afraid of failure after that because, I think, coming that close to death you get kissed. With the years, the actual experience of course fades, but the flavor of it doesn't. I just had a real sense of what choice do I have but to live fully?": "Debra",
  "I don't have a fear factor. Well, not much of one. And I'm willing to risk quite a lot - as a comedian, you're always risking a lot. You're risking failure, especially if you're improvising and going on TV shows trying to make comedy out of thin air. That is quite a risky business.": "David",

  "When I was growing up, Brandy was TV star, reality star, a pop star, a Cover girl, Grammy winner, had her own Brandy doll, and was the first African American to play Disney princess Cinderella. Most importantly, she is a survivor. Many only judge and remember a person's most recent failure.": "Niecy",
  "Sadness is a super important thing not to be ashamed about but to include in our lives. One of the bigger problems with sadness or depression is there's so much shame around it. If you have it you're a failure. You are felt as being very unattractive.": "Mike",
  "The failure of national economic policy is costing us more than jobs; it has begun to weaken that uniquely American spirit of risk-taking, large ambition, and optimism about the future. We must rally them now to bold departures that rebuild our national morale as well as our material prosperity.": "Mitch",
  "It's not a failure if a marriage or partnership ends after a certain number of years. I think, in general, we expect too much of partners. We can't fulfil a person's every single need and, after ten years or so, many relationships wear out. If we were more philosophical about it, we wouldn't try to blame the other person or be bitter.": "Deborah",
  "Case studies of failure should be made a part of the vocabulary of every engineer so that he or she can recall or recite them when something in a new design or design process is suggestive of what went wrong in the case study.": "Henry",
  "Many of the familiar little things that we use every day have typically evolved over a period of time to a state of familiarity. They balance form and function, elegance and economy, success and failure in ways that are not only acceptable, but also admirable.": "Henry",
  "I emphasize that virtually every engineering calculation is ultimately a failure calculation, because without a failure criterion against which to measure the calculated result, it is a meaningless number.": "Henry",
  "I employ case studies of failure into my courses, emphasizing that they teach us much more than studies of success. It is not that success stories cannot serve as models of good design or as exemplars of creative engineering. They can do that, but they cannot teach us how close to failure they are.": "Henry",
  "Relying on nothing but scientific knowledge to produce an engineering solution is to invite frustration at best and failure at worst.": "Henry",
  "I'm sure not afraid of success and I've learned not to be afraid of failure. The only thing I'm afraid of now is of being someone I don't like much.": "Anna",
  "I was convicted of three misdemeanors of willful failure to file a form.": "Wesley",
  "Over the years, I learned that in my career, unlike in life, sometimes my wheelchair is its own automatic door opener. I was able to win the OWN competition by applying one simple principle: be funny, and admit you suck before anyone else can call you out on it. In other words, make the narrative of your failure a comedy.": "Zach",
  "I've tried to handle winning well, so that maybe we'll win again, but I've also tried to handle failure well. If those serve as good examples for teachers and kids, then I hope that would be a contribution I have made to sport. Not just basketball, but to sport.": "Mike",
  "I think some parents now look at a youngster failing as the final thing. It's a process, and failure is part of the process. I would like it if the teacher and the parents would connect more. I think that used to be, but we're losing a little bit of that right now.": "Mike",
  "If a process or adaptation seems too smart for nature, that's a failure of your imagination, not the hand of God. I can make that claim because we have a working model of life's morphing and molding without it.": "Kyle",
  "We are feeble, weak and impoverished because of our failure to pray. God is restrained in doing because we are restrained by reason of our non-praying. All failures in securing heaven are traceable to lack of prayer or misdirected petition.": "Edward",
  "My great fear has always been complete and utter failure. Hence, you see, all the dispossessed people in my fiction, and why I try to earn as much money as I can. It's a defense. I don't enjoy it or do anything with it.": "Peter",
  "In college football, fans wallow in a culture of failure. Unless you root for Miami, you sadly wait for disaster to strike your team in a manner not seen outside of Fenway Park.": "Stephen",
  "The higher the artist, the fewer the gestures. The fewer the tools, the greater the imagination. The greater the will, the greater the secret failure.": "Ben",
  "The worst time was 1983. Love and life and everything went wrong. I reached absolute rock bottom. I saw the Minotaur at the bottom of the abyss. I learnt of the harshness of the world and its impartiality to human failure.": "Ben",
  "I never feel any pressure about a film. What is meant to happen will happen. I have seen failure as well as success several times.": "Akshay",
  "If you're 40 years old and you've never had a failure, you've been deprived.": "Gloria",
  "I have always believed that it's important to show a new look periodically. Predictability can lead to failure.": "T.",
  "I've always believed that it's important to show a new look periodically. Predictability can lead to failure.": "T.",
  "When we're in game worlds, I believe that many of us become the best version of ourselves: the most likely to help at a moment's notice. The most likely to stick with a problem as long as it takes. To get up after failure and try again.": "Jane",
  "Unwillingness to risk failure is always there, but it gets harder when you feel you have more to lose.": "Demi",
  "Yes - I am usually overweight. I have had to be interested in diet because of being diabetic for 30 years and having kidney failure.": "Sue",
  "I think our failure as a caucus has been not to focus on economic issues. I think we - and I'm supportive of all the issues that - that we talk about, but you need an economic - a robust, economic message that - that covers everybody.": "Tim",
  "I think that Obama's failure to reestablish the rule of law in money matters is the most damaging thing that he's done - and perhaps the most damaging thing that has happened in American politics in my lifetime. Because once the rule of law is absent in money matters, then anything really goes in politics.": "James",
  "With the selection of Acting Secret Service Director Joseph P. Clancy as the director, President Obama has guaranteed that the agency will continue to lurch from one shocking security failure to another.": "Ronald",
  "Failure? Scared to death of it.": "Ryan",
  "I've learnt something from every failure. The products I helped design at the first two companies I worked for were utter failures. But now I know why.": "Tony",
  "There's no amount of money that makes you feel better when people think of you as a joke or a hack or a failure or ugly or stupid or morally empty.": "Patrick",
  "I have experienced failure as a politician and for that very reason, I am ready to give everything for Japan.": "Shinzo",
  "When I served as prime minister last time, I failed to prioritize my agenda. I was eager to complete everything at once, and ended my administration in failure. After resigning, for six years I traveled across the nation simply to listen.": "Shinzo",
  "We learn wisdom from failure much more than from success. We often discover what will do, by finding out what will not do; and probably he who never made a mistake never made a discovery.": "Samuel",
  "We need to teach the highly educated man that it is not a disgrace to fail and that he must analyze every failure to find its cause. He must learn how to fail intelligently, for failing is one of the greatest arts in the world.": "Charles",
  "Failure's not a bad thing. It builds character. It makes you stronger.": "Billy",
  "Our failings sometimes bind us to one another as closely as could virtue itself.": "Luc",
  "Indulging in unrestrained and immoderate laughter is a sign of intemperance, of a want of control over one's emotions, and of failure to repress the soul's frivolity by a stern use of reason.": "Saint",
  "Our health-care morass is like the problems of global warming and the national debt - the kind of vast policy failure that is far easier to get into than to get out of. Americans say that they want leaders who will take on these problems.": "Atul",
  "Well, the idea is that failure is an inevitable partner on the road to success and, if you're not willing to confront failure, you can never find out how good you are.": "Peter",
  "Beside every great success are the seeds of enormous failure. In every failure, there's the opportunity seeds of great success. They're not miles apart. So if they're that close together, and if you're really working, you're always gonna have that likelihood that something's not going to work.": "Peter",
  "Young players need freedom of expression to develop as creative players... they should be encouraged to try skills without fear of failure.": "Arsene",
  "Belief in the supernatural reflects a failure of the imagination.": "Edward",
  "Due to the failure of politics, which has become a process of middle-management, art has become one of the last open spaces to question core beliefs and to design a viable future. Art becomes an open space where we can ask fundamental questions about ourselves.": "Antony",
  "Failure to accord credit to anyone for what he may have done is a great weakness in any man.": "William",
  "I stare out the window and reflect on the similarity between writing and saving a life and the inevitable failure of one's imagination and one's goals and ambitions to create a character or a life worth saving.": "Miriam",
  "Nothing helps make a leader more approachable than admitting your struggles, screw-ups and behind-the-scenes thinking on hard calls. If the leader makes this a priority, the whole company will be more open and methodical learning from failure.": "Scott",
  "I'm not scared of anything in particular, but I am motivated by a fear of failure as opposed to a need to succeed.": "Heston",
  "The surest way to fail is not to determine to succeed.": "Richard",
  "Exercise, from a public health perspective, is an unmitigated failure. The world's longest-lived people live in environments that nudge them into more movement. They don't use power tools, they do their own yard work, they grow a garden.": "Dan",
  "Schools don't really allow failure and yet it's a valid part of any endeavour, not just writing.": "Roddy",
  "In school, we learn that mistakes translate into bad grades. This unfortunate lesson gets burned into our brains, and we go through life shunning challenges that might end in failure.": "Mark",
  "But all actors go through the process, it's hit and miss, you have achievement and failure.": "Thomas",
  "We do not realise that we are children of eternity. If we did, then success would be no success, and failure would be no failure to us.": "Joseph",
  "Failure in Afghanistan would have profound consequences for our national security. It would undermine the NATO alliance structure that has been the bedrock of Britain's defence for the last 60 years... I will not allow this to happen on my watch.": "Bob",
  "I think the fall in Eden was ultimately a failure to give thanks.": "Ann",
  "That's the conundrum of cartoon stripping, as opposed to political cartoons. When your anger is the driving force of your drawing hand, failure follows. The anger is OK, but it has to serve the interests of the heart, frankly.": "Berkeley",
  "America traditionally represents the greatest possibility of someone's going from nothing to something. Why? In theory, if not practice, the government stays out of the way and lets individuals take risks and reap rewards or accept the consequences of failure. We call this capitalism - or, at least, we used to.": "Larry",
  "We keep score in life because it matters. It counts. It matters. Too many people opt out and never discover their own abilities because they fear failure. They don't understand commitment.": "Pat",
  "I was a diabetic for 16 years, since I was 14. Being that I lost weight, no more diabetes. You don't have to lose your eyesight, cut off your toes, have a stroke, get kidney failure. You just have to lose weight - you know - for most of the diabetes.": "Fat",
  "The man who has done his level best... is a success, even though the world may write him down a failure.": "B.",
  "Right from my childhood, I have believed in a Supreme Power. I don't know whether it has form, or it is formless. I am a high school dropout. How come life has given me so much? It's not my intelligence, it's not my abilities. This understanding makes me scared even in success. I don't own my success. Neither do I own my failure.": "Pawan",
  "Total failure isn't something I want to spend a lot of time envisioning. I'm pretty sure I'll recognize it if it comes.": "Burton",
  "Critics? Don't talk to me of critics! You think some jackanapes journalist, his soul eaten away by the maggots of jealousy and failure, has anything worthwhile to say of art? I don't.": "Jonathan",
  "I have probably purchased fifty 'hot tips' in my career, maybe even more. When I put them all together, I know I am a net loser.": "Charles",
  "As is well known, 'McCarthyism' was an alleged focus of political evil in the 1950s: Accusations of Communist taint, without factual basis; bogus lists of supposed Communists who never existed; failure in the end to produce even one provable Communist or Soviet agent, despite his myriad charges of subversion.": "M.",
  "It is easier to win than to fail. Everybody sides with the winner. But the failure walks alone.": "George",
  "The hippy movement was a failure.": "Joe",
  "You can't let a failure keep you down, because if you stay down after you fail, you are going to stay down for good.": "Heidi",
  "Failure is what we're all running from, we're always running toward success with failure at our back.": "Natalie",
  "Art school had taught me it was far better to be a flamboyant failure than any kind of benign success.": "Malcolm",
  "I've become a professional failure - in order to pay the mortgage I have to remain unemployed. Luckily, a disaster always seems to befall me at exactly the right moment.": "Toby",
  "There is no such thing as darkness only a failure to see. ": "Malcolm",
  "Some teachers feel that if they ask for emotional help, they're a failure. But teaching is a team sport.": "Erin",

  "The failure to read good books both enfeebles the vision and strengthens our most fatal tendency - the belief that the here and now is all there is.": "Allan",
  "Is anarchism possible? The failure of attempts to attain freedom does not mean the cause is lost.": "Johann",
  "At first I wasn't sure that I had the talent, but I did know I had a fear of failure, and that fear compelled me to fight off anything that might abet it.": "Gordon",
  "I'm not an artist, and I want to take risks, and when the possibility of failure occurs, it's because the idea is all exciting or interesting as a high wire act, and sometimes you've got to fall off, just by virtue of the fact that you're constantly trying to evolve and do new things.": "Peter",
  "In God's world, for those who are in earnest, there is no failure. No work truly done, no word earnestly spoken, no sacrifice freely made, was ever made in vain.": "Frederick",
  "Without exposure to potential failure, there is no risk.": "Brennan",
  "I have a tendency to sabotage relationships; I have a tendency to sabotage everything. Fear of success, fear of failure, fear of being afraid. Useless, good-for-nothing thoughts.": "Michael",
  "When I was 18, I couldn't wait to move away. I was like: 'If I ever have to come back here, I'll kill myself.' Glasgow seemed like failure and death to me back then, but not any more.": "Laura",
  "The world is divided into two categories: failures and unknowns.": "Francis",
  "If the whole process of learning from failure means discarding stuff that's not working, but in fact, our natural reaction is to keep going, to throw more money behind it, to throw more emotional energy behind it... that's a real problem.": "Tim",
  "I was learning the craft; I didn't study writing in school. Rejection was my motivation, and failure is what taught me.": "Pierce",
  "I love language, and I love the failure of language.": "Nate",
  "The U.S. has a law on the books called the debt limit, but the name is misleading. The debt limit started in 1917 for the purpose of facilitating more national debt, not reducing it. It still serves that purpose. It's unconnected to spending, hurts our credit rating and has been an abject failure at limiting debt.": "David",
  "Catastrophes are often stimulated by the failure to feel the emergence of a domain, and so what cannot be felt in the imagination is experienced as embodied sensation in the catastrophe.": "William",
  "I couldn't stand the thought of not succeeding failure was more than I could deal with. ": "Everett",
  "I'm fascinated by failure, and I'm fascinated by finality. Shakespeare's historical plays are more universal than his comedies because they relate to the finality of life. Without finality, life would not be beautiful.": "George",
  "You must not demand the failure of your peers, because the more good things that are around in film, in television, in theater - why the better it is for all of us.": "Jerome",
  "Having in my life been bitten by the jaws of both victory and defeat, I must rush to add that success is to failure as butter pecan ice cream is to death.": "Rupert",
  "If you don't accept failure as a possibility, you don't set high goals, you don't branch out, you don't try - you don't take the risk.": "Rosalynn",
  "I never see failure as failure, but only as the game I must play and win.": "Tom",
  "All that is necessary to break the spell of inertia and frustration is this: Act as if it were impossible to fail. That is the talisman, the formula, the command of right about face which turns us from failure to success.": "Dorothea",
  "The success or failure of a life, as far as posterity goes, seems to lie in the more or less luck of seizing the right moment of escape.": "Alice",
  "Notice the difference between what happens when a man says to himself, I have failed three times, and what happens when he says, I am a failure.": "S.",
  "Mr. Gonzales' failure to respond to questions legitimately posed to him by the Senate raises grave doubts in my mind as to his fitness to serve the people of the United States as their Attorney General.": "Daniel",
  "Entrepreneurs are risk takers, willing to roll the dice with their money or reputation on the line in support of an idea or enterprise. They willingly assume responsibility for the success or failure of a venture and are answerable for all its facets.": "Victor",
  "The assertion of failure coming from such persons does not mean that Mr. Mill failed to promote the practical success of those objects the advocacy of which forms the chief feature of his political writings.": "Millicent",
  "Losing is no disgrace if you've given your best.": "Jim",
  "Any man who has $10,000 left when he dies is a failure.": "Errol",
  "I've criticized President Bush for his failure to use his veto pen. There's plenty of blame to go around. The question is how to solve problems. It's not bailouts. What made America great? Free markets, free enterprise, manufacturing, job creation. That's how we're gonna do it, not by enlarging government.": "Scott",
  "Divorce is never a pleasant experience. You look upon it as a failure. But I learned to be a different person once we broke up. Sometimes you learn more from failure than you do from success.": "Michael",
  "Spend enough time around success and failure, and you learn a reverence for possibility.": "Dale",
  "I wasn't afraid to fail. Something good always comes out of failure.": "Anne",
  "Success and failure are greatly overrated. But failure gives you a whole lot more to talk about.": "Hildegard",

  "The failure of women to have reached positions of leadership has been due in large part to social and professional discrimination.": "Rosalyn",

  "Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness.": "Euripides",
  "Love myself I do. Not everything, but I love the good as well as the bad. I love my crazy lifestyle, and I love my hard discipline. I love my freedom of speech and the way my eyes get dark when I'm tired. I love that I have learned to trust people with my heart, even if it will get broken. I am proud of everything that I am and will become.": "Johnny",
  "Immature love says: 'I love you because I need you.' Mature love says 'I need you because I love you.'": "Erich",
  "Love is friendship that has caught fire. It is quiet understanding, mutual confidence, sharing and forgiving. It is loyalty through good and bad times. It settles for less than perfection and makes allowances for human weaknesses.": "Ann",

  "There is no love without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without love.": "Bryant",
  "Peace is the beauty of life. It is sunshine. It is the smile of a child, the love of a mother, the joy of a father, the togetherness of a family. It is the advancement of man, the victory of a just cause, the triumph of truth.": "Menachem",
  "A successful marriage requires falling in love many times, always with the same person.": "Mignon",

  "Beauty is when you can appreciate yourself. When you love yourself, that's when you're most beautiful.": "Zoe",
  "Nobody can predict the future. You just have to give your all to the relationship you're in and do your best to take care of your partner, communicate and give them every last drop of love you have.

  "Did I offer peace today? Did I bring a smile to someone's face? Did I say words of healing? Did I let go of my anger and resentment? Did I forgive? Did I love? These are the real questions.

  "Study nature, love nature, stay close to nature. It will never fail you.": "Frank",
  "Friends can help each other. A true friend is someone who lets you have total freedom to be yourself - and especially to feel. Or, not feel. Whatever you happen to be feeling at the moment is fine with them. That's what real love amounts to - letting a person be what he really is.": "Jim",
  "A flower cannot blossom without sunshine, and man cannot live without love.": "Max",

  "Unconditional love really exists in each of us. It is part of our deep inner being. It is not so much an active emotion as a state of being. It's not 'I love you' for this or that reason, not 'I love you if you love me.' It's love for no reason, love without an object.": "Ram",
  "I see Americans of every party, every background, every faith who believe that we are stronger together: black, white, Latino, Asian, Native American; young, old; gay, straight; men, women, folks with disabilities, all pledging allegiance under the same proud flag to this big, bold country that we love.

  "True love is like ghosts, which everyone talks about and few have seen.": "Francois",
  "A birthday is just another day where you go to work and people give you love. Age is just a state of mind, and you are as old as you think you are. You have to count your blessings and be happy.": "Abhishek",

  "Love is a mutual self-giving which ends in self-recovery.": "Fulton",
  "Red is such an interesting color to correlate with emotion, because it's on both ends of the spectrum. On one end you have happiness, falling in love, infatuation with someone, passion, all that. On the other end, you've got obsession, jealousy, danger, fear, anger and frustration.": "Taylor",
  "The regret of my life is that I have not said 'I love you' often enough.": "Yoko",

  "Don't ever criticize yourself. Don't go around all day long thinking, 'I'm unattractive, I'm slow, I'm not as smart as my brother.' God wasn't having a bad day when he made you...

  "We must develop and maintain the capacity to forgive. He who is devoid of the power to forgive is devoid of the power to love. There is some good in the worst of us and some evil in the best of us. When we discover this, we are less prone to hate our enemies.": "Martin",
  "I am in you and you in me, mutual in divine love.": "William",
  "True love doesn't happen right away; it's an ever-growing process. It develops after you've gone through many ups and downs, when you've suffered together, cried together, laughed together.": "Ricardo",
  "Spread love everywhere you go. Let no one ever come to you without leaving happier.": "Mother",

  "Love grows more tremendously full, swift, poignant, as the years multiply.": "Zane",

  "Don't aim for success if you want it; just do what you love and believe in, and it will come naturally.": "David",
  "We, the People, recognize that we have responsibilities as well as rights; that our destinies are bound together; that a freedom which only asks what's in it for me, a freedom without a commitment to others, a freedom without love or charity or duty or patriotism, is unworthy of our founding ideals, and those who died in their defense.": "Barack",

  "My friends and family are my support system. They tell me what I need to hear, not what I want to hear and they are there for me in the good and bad times. Without them I have no idea where I would be and I know that their love for me is what's keeping my head above the water.": "Kelly",
  "The human soul is hungry for beauty; we seek it everywhere - in landscape, music, art, clothes, furniture, gardening, companionship, love, religion, and in ourselves. No one would desire not to be beautiful. When we experience the beautiful, there is a sense of homecoming.": "John",

  "Slavery is founded in the selfishness of man's nature - opposition to it is his love of justice. These principles are an eternal antagonism; and when brought into collision so fiercely, as slavery extension brings them, shocks and throes and convulsions must ceaselessly follow.": "Abraham",
  "Religion is meant to teach us true spiritual human character. It is meant for self-transformation. It is meant to transform anxiety into peace, arrogance into humility, envy into compassion, to awaken the pure soul in man and his love for the Source, which is God.": "Radhanath",
  "I love you, and because I love you, I would sooner have you hate me for telling you the truth than adore me for telling you lies.": "Pietro",

  "If you have only one smile in you give it to the people you love.": "Maya",

  "We are born of love, Love is our mother. ": "Rumi",
  "You're not looking for perfection in your partner. Perfection is all about the ego. With soulmate love, you know that true love is what happens when disappointment sets in - and you're willing to deal maturely with these disappointments.": "Karen",

  "God wants us to know that life is a series of beginnings, not endings. Just as graduations are not terminations, but commencements. Creation is an ongoing process, and when we create a perfect world where love and compassion are shared by all, suffering will cease.": "Bernie",
  "Be happy with being you. Love your flaws. Own your quirks. And know that you are just as perfect as anyone else, exactly as you are.": "Ariana",
  "There would be no need for love if perfection were possible.

  "Christmas is the perfect time to celebrate the love of God and family and to create memories that will last forever. Jesus is God's perfect, indescribable gift.

  "A deep sense of love and belonging is an irreducible need of all people. We are biologically, cognitively, physically, and spiritually wired to love, to be loved, and to belong. When those needs are not met, we don't function as we were meant to. We break. We fall apart. We numb. We ache. We hurt others. We get sick.": "Brene",
  "Culture is the intersection of people and life itself. It's how we deal with life, love, death, birth, disappointment... all of that is expressed in culture.": "Wendell",
  "I have my own high standards for what I want in a partner and how I want to be treated. I bring a lot to the table. I'm not talking about material things but what I have to offer as a person - love and loyalty and all the things that make a good relationship.": "Jennifer",

  "Love begins by taking care of the closest ones - the ones at home.": "Mother",
  "Never trust anyone completely but God. Love people, but put your full trust only in God.": "Lawrence",
  "Experts on romance say for a happy marriage there has to be more than a passionate love. For a lasting union, they insist, there must be a genuine liking for each other. Which, in my book, is a good definition for friendship.": "Marilyn",

  "But the love of adventure was in father's blood.": "Buffalo",
  "I need to see my own beauty and to continue to be reminded that I am enough, that I am worthy of love without effort, that I am beautiful, that the texture of my hair and that the shape of my curves, the size of my lips, the color of my skin, and the feelings that I have are all worthy and okay.": "Tracee",
  "The minute I heard my first love story, I started looking for you, not knowing how blind that was. Lovers don't finally meet somewhere. They're in each other all along.": "Rumi",
  "No one can make you happy. No one can help you grow in life more than you can. I can love you to death, but I can only go so far. I can inspire and encourage you as much as I can, but when you play an active role to find that self-security and that self-worth, it makes the difference.": "Musiq",
  "My eye is ever on those who love me.": "Sai",
  "In life, you have to take the pace that love goes. You don't force it. You just don't force love, you don't force falling in love, you don't force being in love - you just become. I don't know how to say that in English, but you just feel it.": "Juan",
  "You just have to get rid of fear and confront the world. Look at yourself in the mirror and say to yourself, 'I love you and nothing will destroy you and you're not going to fall.'": "Ricky",
  "In the stillness of your presence, you can feel your own formless and timeless reality as the unmanifested life that animates your physical form. You can then feel the same life deep within every other human and every other creature. You look beyond the veil of form and separation. This is the realization of oneness. This is love.": "Eckhart",
  "If you love somebody, let them go, for if they return, they were always yours. And if they don't, they never were.": "Khalil",
  "I love it when people doubt me. It makes me work harder to prove them wrong.": "Derek",
  "We are supposed to enjoy the good stuff now, while we can, with the people we love. Life has a funny way of teaching us that lesson over and over again.": "Sheena",
  "I trust you: That's huge. That's truth. That's real love. Everyone uses 'I love you' so loosely.": "Justin",
  "The beginning of love is to let those we love be perfectly themselves, and not to twist them to fit our own image. Otherwise we love only the reflection of ourselves we find in them.": "Thomas",
  "We are not the same persons this year as last; nor are those we love. It is a happy chance if we, changing, continue to love a changed person.": "W.",
  "In my life I've learned that true happiness comes from giving. Helping others along the way makes you evaluate who you are. I think that love is what we're all searching for. I haven't come across anyone who didn't become a better person through love.": "Marla",
  "We may not know what each day has in store for us. We could be gone tomorrow. Any minute could truly be our goodbye. But we do have this moment. This time. Today. Right now. It takes way more effort to shell out hate then it does to allow love to flow freely in our lives. After all, it's what we were born to do.": "Grace",
  "Patriotism is when love of your own people comes first; nationalism, when hate for people other than your own comes first.": "Charles",
  "The thing is that love gives us a ringside seat on somebody else's flaws, so of course you're gonna spot some things that kinda need to be mentioned. But often the romantic view is to say, 'If you loved me, you wouldn't criticise me.' Actually, true love is often about trying to teach someone how to be the best version of themselves.": "Alain",
  "Love one another and help others to rise to the higher levels, simply by pouring out love. Love is infectious and the greatest healing energy.": "Sai",
  "Every one has her own love life. Every one has a dream to get a perfect life partner. But this is not so easy in real life. In fact, one doesn't love; it happens.": "Katrina",
  "Love is friendship set on fire.": "Jeremy",
  "True love is not a strong, fiery, impetuous passion. It is, on the contrary, an element calm and deep. It looks beyond mere externals, and is attracted by qualities alone. It is wise and discriminating, and its devotion is real and abiding.": "Ellen",
  "Yes, it was love at first sight. I feel that after all these years, I have finally found my soul mate.": "Barbara",
  "Going home, spending time with the family, I feel they're my friends as well, all of them. I look forward to meeting any one of them for a coffee, and when we all get together, I just love it.": "Domhnall",
  "Power is of two kinds. One is obtained by the fear of punishment and the other by acts of love. Power based on love is a thousand times more effective and permanent then the one derived from fear of punishment.": "Mahatma",
  "Love is the silent saying and saying of a single name.": "Mignon",

  "Believe in yourself, listen to your gut, and do what you love.": "Dylan",
  "Hunting forces a person to endure, to master themselves, even to truly get to know the wild environment. Actually, along the way, hunting and fishing makes you fall in love with the natural world. This is why hunters so often give back by contributing to conservation.": "Donald",

  "Friendship may, and often does, grow into love, but love never subsides into friendship.": "Lord",
  "Love is a really scary thing, and you never know what's going to happen. It's one of the most beautiful things in life, but it's one of the most terrifying. It's worth the fear because you have more knowledge, experience, you learn from people, and you have memories.": "Ariana",
  "When love and skill work together, expect a masterpiece.": "John",
  "Love does not claim possession, but gives freedom.": "Rabindranath",
  "Love yourself, whatever makes you different, and use it to make you stand out. Mine is my voice and the fact that I'm gay: well, the fact that I'm flamboyantly gay.": "Ross",
  "True, we love life, not because we are used to living, but because we are used to loving. There is always some madness in love, but there is also always some reason in madness.": "Petrarch",
  "Life is difficult for everyone; everyone has bad days. Everyone has trouble in their life, because it doesn't matter how rich you are: Sickness and trouble and worry and love, these things will mess with you at every level of life.": "Domhnall",
  "Family is a unique gift that needs to be appreciated and treasured, even when they're driving you crazy. As much as they make you mad, interrupt you, annoy you, curse at you, try to control you, these are the people who know you the best and who love you.": "Jenna",
  "I do not think there is any thrill that can go through the human heart like that felt by the inventor as he sees some creation of the brain unfolding to success... such emotions make a man forget food, sleep, friends, love, everything.": "Nikola",
  "Our love, our gratitude, our admiration for our men and women in uniform, our veterans and their families - all of that is bigger than any one party or any one election.": "Michelle",
  "I love my wife and I know she loves me. We're best friends. We're just lucky to have found each other. It takes a lot of work but I just feel very blessed that I found the right person. It's a very fortunate situation and not everyone has that.": "Harry",

  "I love looking in the mirror and feeling good about what I see.": "Heather",

  "To love is to act.": "Victor",
  "Love will find its way through all languages on its own.": "Rumi",
  "There is no friendship, no love, like that of the parent for the child.": "Henry",
  "Even in the deepest love relationship - when lovers say 'I love you' to each other - we don't really know what we're saying, because language isn't equal to the complexity of human emotions.": "Duane",
  "The best thing about being a DJ is making people happy. There is nothing like seeing people get up from a table to dance or the expression on their face when they hear a song they love. I also love to educate people on music they have never heard.": "Chelsea",
  "Patriotism is love of country. But you can't love your country without loving your countrymen and countrywomen. We don't always have to agree, but we must empower each other, we must find the common ground, we must build bridges across our differences to pursue the common good.": "Cory",
  "My goal is to be able to provide for myself and not have to worry about the daily expenses. I do want to be able to benefit from my work and make a good living, but I love it so much that I would do it for free.": "Jenn",
  "People happy in love have an air of intensity.": "Stendhal",

  "Football is unconditional love.": "Tom",
  "I love being on the road. I love that lifestyle, traveling city to city, rocking out and moving on to the next place.": "Caleb",
  "Patriotism is not an abstract concept. It begins from one's own home. It buds out from the love for one's parents, spouses and children, the love for one's own home, village and workplace, and further develops into the love for one's country and fellow people.": "Kim",
  "Now, what really makes a teacher is love for the human child; for it is love that transforms the social duty of the educator into the higher consciousness of a mission.": "Maria",
  "Wherever the art of medicine is loved, there is also a love of humanity.": "Hippocrates",
  "I'm in love with red. I think it's such a passionate color. Every flag of every country pretty much has red it it. It's power, there's no fence sitting with red. Either you love it or you don't. I think its blood and strength and life. I do love red. I love all colors. Great shades of blue, you find them in nature. They're all magic.": "Bryan",

  "True love doesn't come to you it has to be inside you.": "Julia",
  "What I've enjoyed most, though, is meeting people who have a real interest in food and sharing ideas with them. Good food is a global thing and I find that there is always something new and amazing to learn - I love it!": "Jamie",
  "I think it's not really difficult to write about love. We've been saying the same thing over and over for so many years. But it depends on how honest it is and how good you make it feel. You can say 'I love you' in a trillion ways, and it can always sound different or feel different.": "Babyface",
  "People confuse ego, lust, insecurity with true love.": "Simon",
  "I don't love studying. I hate studying. I like learning. Learning is beautiful.": "Natalie",
  "The hunger for love is much more difficult to remove than the hunger for bread.": "Mother",
  "I love women, but I feel like you can't trust some of them. Some of them are liars, you know? Like I was in the park and I met this girl, she was cute and she had a dog. And I went up to her, we started talking. She told me her dog's name. Then I said, 'Does he bite?' She said, 'No.' And I said, 'Oh yeah? Then how does he eat?' Liar.": "Demetri",

  "Let's practice motivation and love, not discrimination and hate.": "Zendaya",
  "I love the name of honor, more than I fear death.": "Julius",
  "The Bible tells us to love our neighbors as ourselves. Surely part of loving in this way is trying to understand what another person wants us to understand. I may not understand perfectly and I may not agree, but if I love you I should try to know what it is you wish I could know.": "Kevin",
  "No human creature can give orders to love.": "George",
  "A pair of powerful spectacles has sometimes sufficed to cure a person in love.": "Friedrich",

  "I love to be outdoors, so I like to hike, bike and go to the beach.": "Jillian",
  "I love fairy tales because of their haunting beauty and magical strangeness. They are set in worlds where anything can happen.

  "You are loved just for being who you are, just for existing. You don't have to do anything to earn it.

  "Always kiss your children goodnight, even if they're already asleep.": "H.",
  "To be a good father and mother requires that the parents defer many of their own needs and desires in favor of the needs of their children. As a consequence of this sacrifice, conscientious parents develop a nobility of character and learn to put into practice the selfless truths taught by the Savior Himself.": "James",
  "Children are educated by what the grown-up is and not by his talk.": "Carl",
  "When you hold your baby in your arms the first time, and you think of all the things you can say and do to influence him, it's a tremendous responsibility. What you do with him can influence not only him, but everyone he meets and not for a day or a month or a year but for time and eternity.": "Rose",
  "Every word, facial expression, gesture, or action on the part of a parent gives the child some message about self-worth. It is sad that so many parents don't realize what messages they are sending.": "Virginia",
  "I'm not a parenting expert. In fact, I'm not sure that I even believe in the idea of 'parenting experts.' I'm an engaged, imperfect parent and a passionate researcher. I'm an experienced mapmaker and a stumbling traveler. Like many of you, parenting is by far my boldest and most daring adventure.": "Brene",
  "Children are not casual guests in our home. They have been loaned to us temporarily for the purpose of loving them and instilling a foundation of values on which their future lives will be built.": "James",
  "The number of stressors has multiplied exponentially: traffic, money, success, work/life balance, the economy, the environment, parenting, family conflict, relationships, disease. As the nature of human life has become far more complicated, our ancient stress response hasn't been able to keep up.": "Andrew",
  "Parents were invented to make children happy by giving them something to ignore.": "Ogden",
  "Even as kids reach adolescence, they need more than ever for us to watch over them. Adolescence is not about letting go. It's about hanging on during a very bumpy ride.": "Ron",

  "The child supplies the power but the parents have to do the steering.": "Benjamin",
  "Abortion is defended today as a means of ensuring the equality and independence of women, and as a solution to the problems of single parenting, child abuse, and the feminization of poverty.": "Robert",
  "There are times as a parent when you realize that your job is not to be the parent you always imagined you'd be, the parent you always wished you had. Your job is to be the parent your child needs, given the particulars of his or her own life and nature.": "Ayelet",
  "The more people have studied different methods of bringing up children the more they have come to the conclusion that what good mothers and fathers instinctively feel like doing for their babies is the best after all.": "Benjamin",
  "Every cliche about kids is true; they grow up so quickly, you blink and they're gone, and you have to spend the time with them now. But that's a joy.": "Liam",
  "To me luxury is to be at home with my daughter, and the occasional massage doesn't hurt.": "Olivia",
  "Autism is a neurological disorder. It's not caused by bad parenting. It's caused by, you know, abnormal development in the brain. The emotional circuits in the brain are abnormal. And there also are differences in the white matter, which is the brain's computer cables that hook up the different brain departments.": "Temple",

  "Relationships are complicated no matter what style of parenting you choose.": "Mayim",
  "Childhood obesity is best tackled at home through improved parental involvement, increased physical exercise, better diet and restraint from eating.": "Bob",
  "I think parenting these days is definitely different from when a lot of people grew up. As much blame as we give a lot of our kids for what they're not doing... I also try to give them as much credit for dealing with things that we didn't have to deal with. Bullying was one on one and face to face. Now it's all over the Internet.": "Nelly",
  "Loving a child doesn't mean giving in to all his whims; to love him is to bring out the best in him, to teach him to love what is difficult.": "Nadia",
  "It's a great mistake, I think, to put children off with falsehoods and nonsense, when their growing powers of observation and discrimination excite in them a desire to know about things.": "Anne",
  "You know, parenting is so personal. And we're all afraid that we didn't quite get it right. And it feels like the stakes are so high. By we - what if we made a mistake?": "Amy",

  "Love is staying up all night with a sick child - or a healthy adult.": "David",

  "Family involvement is a valuable thing and playing together actively can be the '90s version of it. Instead of just watching, you can do it together... something we don't spend enough time on. We can motivate and excite each other about fitness.": "Alan",
  "Parenthood always comes as a shock. Postpartum blues? Postpartum panic is more like it. We set out to have a baby what we get is a total take-over of our lives. ": "Polly",
  "The unconditional love for you child, it's truly amazing.": "Jourdan",
  "Everywhere, people are discovering that doing things more slowly often means doing them better and enjoying them more. It means living life instead of rushing through it. You can apply this to everything from food to parenting to work.": "Carl",
  "Parenting is one of the hardest jobs on earth.": "Jennifer",
  "Parenting is not for sissies. You have to sacrifice and grow up.": "Jillian",
  "Parenting is the hardest thing I have ever done. I tried to find the balance between the strict, traditional Chinese way I was raised, which I think can be too harsh, and what I see as a tendency in the West to be too permissive and indulgent. If I could do it all again, I would, with some adjustments.": "Amy",
  "My husband's a pediatrician, so he and I talk about parenting all the time. You can't raise children who have more shame resilience than you do.": "Brene",
  "Giving kids whatever they ask for is disastrous parenting. There's no sense of something earned. I'm sorry, but when you're 12, you don't need a new cell phone every few months just because a new one comes out.": "Ewan",
  "The secret to success, to parenting, to life, is to not count up the cost. Don't focus on all the steps it will take. Don't stare into the abyss at the giant leap it will take. That view will keep you from taking the next small step.": "Regina",
  "The parenting style that is good for grit is also the parenting style good for most other things: Be really, really demanding, and be very, very supportive.": "Angela",
  "Modern parents want to nurture so skillfully that Mother Nature will gasp in admiration at the marvels their parenting produces from the soft clay of children.": "George",
  "You learn that there's no right way to do it, no wrong way to do it. It's just what you feel comfortable with, to trust that, and don't let anybody box you in to a certain style of parenting or make you feel a certain way about what your kids do.": "Stephen",
  "That's my parenting style - 'Go watch the TV.' I'm one of 11 children, and my mother's parenting style was, 'There's the TV. Go watch it. Mommy's got 10 other people to take care of.'": "Stephen",
  "Nobody ever becomes an expert parent. But I think good parenting is about consistency. It's about being there at big moments, but it's also just the consistency of decision making. And it's routine.": "Sebastian",
  "Tell me how a person judges his or her self-esteem, and I will tell you how that person operates at work, in love, in sex, in parenting, in every important aspect of existence - and how high he or she is likely to rise.

  "If you're financially responsible, your children have a much better chance to grow up financially responsible.": "Suze",
  "Many people think that discipline is the essence of parenting. But that isn't parenting. Parenting is not telling your child what to do when he or she misbehaves. Parenting is providing the conditions in which a child can realize his or her full human potential.": "Gordon",
  "Kids are fat because of lack of parenting.": "Ben",
  "Parenting involves two separate activities. You have to change your child in that you need to educate your child and instill moral values in them. But you also need to celebrate your child for who he or she is and make them feel really good.": "Andrew",

  "The uncertainty of parenting can bring up feelings in us that range from frustration to terror.": "Brene",
  "If I feel good about my parenting, I have no interest in judging other people's choices. If I feel good about my body, I don't go around making fun of other people's weight or appearance. We're hard on each other because we're using each other as a launching pad out of our own perceived deficiency.": "Brene",
  "I came to parenting the way most of us do - knowing nothing and trying to learn everything.": "Mayim",
  "Leave part of the yard rough. Don't manicure everything. Small children in particular love to turn over rocks and find bugs, and give them some space to do that. Take your child fishing. Take your child on hikes.": "Richard",

  "Of course, the ideal scenario for parenting is obviously two parents of a mature age.": "Jennifer",
  "Parenting now is a two-way relationship where you learn from each other.": "Juhi",
  "What lingers from the parent's individual past, unresolved or incomplete, often becomes part of her or his irrational parenting.": "Virginia",
  "I have a neuroscience background - that's what my doctorate is in - and I was trained to study hormones of attachment, so I definitely feel my parenting is informed by that.": "Mayim",
  "If two very different people pool their DNA, they'll create more genetic variety, and their young will come to the job of parenting with a wider array of skills.": "Helen",
  "In truth, I am a single mother. But I don't feel alone at all in parenting my daughter. Krishna has a whole other side of her family who loves her, too. And so Krishna is parented by me, but also by her grandmother and aunts and cousins and uncles and friends.": "Padma",
  "Thing is, I went to a born-again Christian high school, was brought up in a traditional Mormon family where these ideas about parenting are of structure and sacrifice. To think outside of that idea of family and parenting that I've grown up with is tough but also very freeing.": "Paul",

  "That's my ideal day, time with my boys.": "Kenny",
  "Success for me its to raise happy, healthy human beings.": "Kelly",
  "The Golden Rule of Parenting is do unto your children as you wish your parents had done unto you! ": "Louise",
  "Don't reward bad behavior. It is one of the first rules of parenting. During the financial cataclysm of 2008, we said it differently. When we bailed out banks that had created their own misfortune, we called it a 'moral hazard,' because the bailout absolved the bank's bad acts and created an incentive for it to make the same bad loans again.": "Eliot",
  "As a dad, you are the Vice President of the executive branch of parenting. It doesn't matter what your personality is like, you will always be Al Gore to your wife's Bill Clinton. She feels the pain and you are the annoying nerd telling them to turn off the lights.": "Jim",
  "We put more emphasis on who can drive a car than on who can be a parent. And I think there ought to be mandatory parenting classes starting in high school, and you should have to have a license to be able to be a parent to explain that you don't give alcohol to kids.": "Dale",
  "Learning from wolves to interact with pet dogs makes about as much sense as, 'I want to improve my parenting - let's see how the chimps do it!'": "Ian",
  "I've decided the secret of parenting is benevolent neglect.": "Barry",
  "Sleeping is one of the more private aspects of parenting; it happens in a quiet room, whereas eating is a more public aspect of parenting. Other people can see it and compare it to what their kids eat.": "Adam",
  "Happiness is not always through success. Equally, the constant pursuit of success is sure unhappiness. But we have to find the balance. My own thoughts are that parenting is very personal. And we all feel enormous insecurity about parenting. What are they going to think of us 20 years down the line?": "Amy",
  "To me, Slow parenting is about bringing balance into the home. Children need to strive and struggle and stretch themselves, but that does not mean childhood should be a race. Slow parents give their children plenty of time and space to explore the world on their own terms.": "Carl",
  "My parents were definitely on the incentive side of parenting. Like, they told me that my father had learned to read when he was three. So, of course, I thought I had to, too.": "Chelsea",
  "Don't judge other people. For example, if you want God's anointing to be on you for parenting, you need to be careful not to criticize other parents.": "Joyce",
  "I think Lincoln had a unique parenting style. He let his kids run free and wild.": "Steven",
  "Most moms and dads, they want to be good moms and dads. But it's an incredibly hard job when you are stressed out, when you are poor, when your life is in chaos. And giving them some of the tools to be better parents, to whittle away at that parenting gap, gives those kids a much better starting point in life.": "Nicholas",
  "I sort of feel like people are not that honest about their own parenting. Take any teenage household tell me there is not yelling and conflict. ": "Amy",
  "Tiger parenting is all about raising independent, creative, courageous kids. In America today, there's a dangerous tendency to romanticize creativity in a way that may undermine it.": "Amy",
  "I believe that at least 70 percent of parenting goes to the mother. In our house, I'm the one who knows about all the school stuff, helps with the homework, organizes the play dates, and remembers the birthday parties.": "Cindy",
  "The basic idea that incentives can be used to motivate behavior is a powerful one. It works for employees, and it has a clear place in parenting, as anyone who has tried to potty-train a recalcitrant toddler with sticker rewards knows.": "Emily",
  "Parenting is the most important job on the planet next to keeping Gary Busey off the nation's highways.": "Dennis",
  "Parenting is not giving your child everything they want. Parenting is not being your child's friend. Parenting is about preparing your child to be a useful and respectful person in society.": "GloZell",
  "Children live in the only successful Marxist state ever created: the family. 'From each according to his ability, to each according to his need' is the family's practice as well as its theory. Even with today's scattershot patterns of marriage and parenting, a family is collectivist to a more than North Korean degree.": "P.",
  "Most American children suffer too much mother and too little father.": "Gloria",
  "My childhood should have taught me lessons for my own fatherhood, but it didn't because parenting can only be learned by people who have no children.": "Bill",
  "My son was five months old, and I built a makeshift studio in my living room so that I could do the attachment parenting approach and write the record at the same time. That was fortuitous, that we could build that in the house.": "Alanis",
  "I think parenting is very different now. We're totally governed by our children!": "Andy",
  "Parenting is not for everybody. It changes your life. Especially when they're little.": "Tori",
  "Gerard and I pretty much share all parenting responsibilities, although I'm definitely the disciplinarian.": "Shakira",
  "From politics to parenting, Christians have something to say.": "Monica",
  "Ironically, parenting is a shame and judgment minefield precisely because most of us are wading through uncertainty and self-doubt when it comes to raising our children.": "Brene",
  "Growth doesn't hurt. This is what I've learned. In the end, it doesn't hurt. It hurts while it's happening. But in the end, you know, for life, for parenting, and for the arts, it's not a bad - not a bad thing to try for.": "Laura",
  "The children who are 'our future' will inherit a world created not just by parental devotion but by the sort of zealous, focused endeavors that can preclude good parenting.": "Virginia",
  "I barely have time for my own children. To adopt more children and not have time for them, that would be poor parenting on my part.": "Mary",
  "Parenting isn't just parenting your own child.": "Lewis",
  "Whatever needed to be done, I need to know how to do it just as well as my wife. You know, for us to be able to really balance the parenting. It was very humbling, and it was also, um - terrifying. Because, you know, giving a baby a bath for the first time is one of the scariest things you can do on this whole earth.": "Jason",
  "I've been lucky enough to live through all the things that are supposed to give meaning to our lives, like parenting, grandparenting, art, celebrity. All these things you expect meaning to come from, and sometimes it comes when you're not expecting it.": "Alan",
  "Becoming a father, I think it inevitably changes your perspective of life. I don't get nearly enough sleep. And the simplest things in life are completely satisfying. I find you don't have to do as much, like you don't go on as many outings.": "Hugh",
  "I love to read books that focus on parenting topics because there are so many different ways to do things. I find these books offer a lot of great opinions on many different subjects.": "Kourtney",
  "I am always trying to evolve, so I like to read parenting books and things like that.": "Kourtney",
  "We learn much of parenting from our own parents. My love for my father deepened profoundly when he was kind, patient, and understanding.": "James",
  "The interesting thing about being a mother is that everyone wants pets, but no one but me cleans the kitty litter.": "Meryl",
  "My parents were divorced when I was a young teenager, and I was raised by a single mother after that. So, I understand the difficulties that families have. I understand single parenting.": "Michele",
  "As a housewife, I feel that if the kids are still alive when my husband gets home from work, then hey, I've done my job.": "Roseanne",
  "I'm torn about late parenting. I believe people should spend their twenties living and having fun and not having any regrets later. I also think people in their thirties generally make better parents but so many of my friends are having trouble - myself included - as fathers get older.": "Eric",
  "My work makes me a better mom. It gives me a little door to step out of my parenting and bring the excitement from my day back home.": "Christie",
  "My guess is that good and bad parenting is spread fairly evenly across different social groups. But can you imagine Tony Blair lecturing the middle class on how to bring up their children? He is far more comfortable as a latter-day exponent of the Poor Law mentality.": "Martin",
  "In my experience (I am the lone father of an eight-year-old boy who lost his mother when he was one year old), parenting is the most difficult of all jobs: forget your chief executives, editors, prime ministers and the like - parenting is far more challenging.": "Martin",
  "My grandmother was a kind of Scarsdale, New York, society woman, best known in her day as the author of the 1959 book 'Growing Your Own Way: An Informal Guide for Teen-Agers' - this despite being a person whose parenting style made Joan Crawford's wire hangers look like pool noodles.": "Sloane",
  "Ah, the power of two. There's nothing quite like it. Especially when it comes to paying utility bills, parenting, cooking elaborate meals, purchasing a grown-up bed, jumping rope and lifting heavy machinery. The world favours pairs. Who wants to waste the wood building an ark for singletons?": "Sloane",
  "A picture excites the love of parenting that comes through meditation on a child.": "John",
  "Parenthood and family come first for me, and when I'm not working I'm cool with the Teletubbies.": "Clive",
  "Very often when you see families it's all perfect and neat, and parenting isn't like that. You do have constant negotiations. Things are ever developing and ever changing, and you constantly have to evaluate how you deal with your kids.": "Clive",
  "There's this constant guilt that comes with parenting. You always feel like you're never enough. If you're confident in your parenting, you probably suck at it.": "Nia",
  "'Kramer vs. Kramer' is one of my favorite films, where you have a story that really juxtaposes a lot of ideas that we have about family and about parenting.": "Taylor",
  "The parenting bit is much harder than the acting bit. You just never know what to do.": "Helena",
  "Kids are a great analogy. You want your kids to grow up, and you don't want your kids to grow up. You want your kids to become independent of you, but it's also a parent's worst nightmare: That they won't need you. It's like the real tragedy of parenting.": "Jonathan",
  "While not impossible, it is especially challenging for teenage parents to develop bonds with their children. A high percent of them were themselves children of teenage parents and have never experienced appropriate parenting.": "Jane",
  "I think a dad has to make his daughter feel that he's genuinely interested in what she's going through.": "Harry",
  "I think that good parenting should allow children to be children. That naivety and slightly open way of looking at the world is very valuable.": "Robert",
  "The Internet is just bringing all kinds of information into the home. There's just a lot of distraction, a lot of competition for the parent's voice to resonate in the children's ears.": "Phil",
  "Having children with someone is the real bond.": "Francesca",
  "My parenting heroes are the Obamas! They've been married for so long, and it looks like they're having fun, and their kids are down to earth, well-adjusted, and smart. They seem to have a strong family unit that I would like to emulate in my life.": "GloZell",
  "Today's new age parenting guarantees you'll hear children screaming, whining, and begging for items and attention in an airplane, store or any other public place.": "GloZell",
  "The government cannot overcome bad parenting. What our leaders can do is publicly condemn irresponsible parental behavior in vivid terms.": "Bill",
  "There's no handbook for parenting. So you walk a very fine line as a parent because you are civilizing these raw things. They will tip the coffee over and finger-paint on the table. At some point, you have to say, 'We're gonna have to clean that up because you don't paint with coffee on a table.'": "Gary",
  "Parenting is an impossible job at any age.": "Harrison",
  "In Los Angeles, parenting is a competitive sport. From Beverly Hills baby boutiques to kids' yoga classes, L.A. fuses high style, industrial-strength materialism, and parental outsourcing into our own unique version of child-rearing.": "Shawn",
  "No fathers or mothers think their own children ugly.": "Miguel",
  "No, I've never wanted kids. But I do read about parenting a lot.": "Fiona",
  "Parenting girls makes you quite gender-conscious - it's almost impossible to fight the power of pink. It's not such a terrible thing to want to be a princess when you're five, but it would be nice if there were some other options.": "Robert",
  "I'm worried about parents who aren't parenting.": "Barbara",
  "Women are individuals in parenting, and why not?": "Erica",
  "I'm trying to break any chain of negative parenting that I might have survived.": "Eddie",
  "I want to have children, but my friends scare me. One of my friends told me she was in labor for 36 hours. I don't even want to do anything that feels good for 36 hours.": "Rita",
  "What parent has it easy? I just never make the difficulty of it an obstacle. I just do it.": "Marlee",
  "I would love to have kids one day. In fact, I'm pretty good with them. I grew up with five half-siblings, the youngest of whom is 11 years younger than me, so I think I learned some pretty cool parenting skills quite early on in life.": "Matthew",
  "Asian American success is often presented as something of a horror - robotic, unfeeling machines psychotically hellbent on excelling, products of abusive tiger parenting who care only about test scores and perfection, driven to succeed without even knowing why.": "Jenny",
  "No matter how much time you spend reading books or following your intuition, you're gonna screw it up. Fifty times. You can't do parenting right.": "Alan",
  "Loving and parenting a dog as a single parent can create all sorts of new and unusual problems, but also new sources of joy.": "Jenna",
  "My dad was not super-intentional in his parenting. He was very self-absorbed. I won't say mean or selfish per se, but very self-absorbed. I think he was just thinking out loud.": "Angela",
  "Parenting is tough.": "Kate",
  "Around a third of parents still worry that they will look like a bad mother or father if their child has a mental health problem. Parenting is hard enough without letting prejudices stop us from asking for the help we need for ourselves and our children.": "Kate",
  "I love, love, love being an actor - it's still the hardest and scariest thing I do, outside of parenting. But I've always been someone who likes a busy day.": "Sarah",
  "I'm afraid the parenting advice to come out of developmental psychology is very boring: pay attention to your kids and love them.": "Alison",
  "The science can tell you that the thousands of pseudo-scientific parenting books out there - not to mention the 'Baby Einstein' DVDs and the flash cards and the brain-boosting toys - won't do a thing to make your baby smarter. That's largely because babies are already as smart as they can be smarter than we are in some ways. ": "Alison",
  "I would like to do another piece of fiction dealing with a number of issues: Lesbian parenting, the 1960's, and interracial relationships in the Lesbian and Gay community.": "Audre",
  "The thing about parenting rules is there aren't any. That's what makes it so difficult.": "Ewan",
  "Mama and Daddy King represent the best in manhood and womanhood, the best in a marriage, the kind of people we are trying to become.": "Coretta",
  "We had a kid. The kid was awesome. She didn't fall asleep easily. We complained about it. We got frustrated. But we didn't look for an out. We just accepted that this was part of parenting.": "Adam",
  "When it comes right down to it, developing a critical sensibility about parenting isn't really about disapproval; it's about honing your own sensibilities, figuring out how you want to parent.": "Adam",
  "It's hilarious to me that by writing an obscene fake children's book I am mistaken for a parenting expert.": "Adam",
  "I do not think there was anything abusive in my house. Yet, I stand by a lot of my critiques of Western parenting. I think there's a lot of questions about how you instill true self-esteem.": "Amy",
  "To be honest, I know that a lot of Asian parents are secretly shocked and horrified by many aspects of Western parenting.": "Amy",
  "I think there are many ways to raise great kids. From what I can tell, Ayelet Waldman's kids are interesting, strong, and happy, and if that's the case, that's good parenting.": "Amy",
  "We go into parenting, and we discover that we don't have the answers. We are at a loss.": "Julia",
  "Parenting is no sport for perfectionists.": "Andrew",
  "The most rewarding aspect of parenting is seeing my children be authentic. The most rewarding thing for me is to see them do anything that they're proud of.": "Jamie",
  "The challenging part of parenting for me is to make sure that an individual person is an individual and not some sort of cookie-cutter version of me. At the same time, I want to make sure that I impart my sense of the world as an adult.": "Jamie",
  "Attachment parenting demands not just certain actions you take with your baby but also certain emotional states to accompany those actions.": "Hanna",
  "I don't think my father considered allowing a teenager to follow his dreams was necessarily good parenting, or even parenting. I think he thought I was a teenager with teenage impulses. I'm pretty sure he knew that if he just let me follow those impulses, it would wind up being very expensive and perhaps even life-endangering.": "W.",
  "Parenting is difficult under any circumstances, and in my father's view, to raise a morally upright and honest child, you sometimes have to lie to him.": "W.",
  "I think I'm going to have to live vicariously through my daughter's rebellion because I certainly never did go through adolescence.": "Brooke",
  "I thought that once we were out of the baby stage, parenting would be a breeze.": "Tori",
  "I'm not a parent, but it seems to me the nature of parenting is contingent, full of unexpected challenges - which is one of the wonderful and amazing things about it.": "Stacey",
  "Parenting is meant to be just a natural part of life. You just think you know how to do it but, of course, it's much more complicated than that.": "Essie",
  "As soon as you become a parent, everyone gives you their parenting advice. It's like an onslaught of information about how other people do it.": "Essie",
  "It's a huge change for your body. You don't even want to look in the mirror after you've had a baby, because your stomach is just hanging there like a Shar-Pei.": "Cindy",
  "Studies show that children best flourish when one mom and one dad are there to raise them.": "John",
  "I feel very blessed to have two wonderful, healthy children who keep me completely grounded, sane and throw up on my shoes just before I go to an awards show just so I know to keep it real.": "Reese",
  "Society should see parenting as a public health issue and help parents to bring their children up feeling loved. We have birthing classes, but no parenting classes. The latter is desperately needed if we are to avoid self-destruction.": "Bernie",
  "I've become sort of an accidental advocate for attachment parenting, which is a style of parenting that... basically, the way mammals parent and the way people have parented for pretty much all of human history except the last 200 years or so.": "Mayim",
  "Attachment parenting is not a passive parenting style.": "Mayim",
  "Indeed - judicious, consistent parenting is a dream of mine. No judgements, learning space and listening carefully are my goals.": "Emma",
  "I hope to find the roles that are age appropriate but not yearning to be younger, or parenting ad nauseam.": "Debra",
  "It's hard enough to work and raise a family when your kids are all healthy and relatively normal, but when you add on some kind of disability or disease, it can just be such a burden.": "Patricia",
  "I don't think children's inner feelings have changed. They still want a mother and father in the very same house they want places to play. ": "Beverly",
  "My approach to parenting is that everything is open - everything. I'm not very good at covert, or subtle, and I've had to learn timing. I do blunder in a bit.": "Dawn",
  "I have a shallow understanding of what it means to be alive, and I know certain things about parenting and being a wife and doing the school run. I know little bits, but I'm really a paddler on a beach.": "Tamsin",
  "Being a chef isn't the ideal career to intersect with parenting, but I try to be in my kids' lives as much as possible.": "Wylie",
  "I adore my family. I don't love their politics. I think they're wonderful parents. They were dreadful at parenting.": "Alexandra",
  "Should kids check phones at dinner? I don't know. To me, that's a parenting choice.": "Sundar",
  "I think we've moved to thinking of parenting and pregnancy as something in which you should lose yourself.": "Emily",
  "I feel sure that unborn babies pick their parents.": "Gloria",
  "I told my kids when they were little, 'Look, kids, your mother and I are screwing you up somehow. We don't understand how, or we wouldn't do it. But we're parents. So somehow we're damaging you, and I want you to know that early. So just ignore me when I go to that part of my parenting.'": "Pat",
  "Here's a confession: I hate parenting books. I hate the ones that are earnest and repetitive.": "Bruce",
  "I set out to write an anti-parenting parenting book.": "Bruce",
  "We're living in a time when parenting is not at all mirroring the way I was parented. For me, I just followed my parents around on their errands; when they were busy on the phone, I was quiet. It's a different kettle of fish these days: They run the house, and you listen to their music, and you go to their appointments.": "Edie",
  "The truth about parenting is that the reality of our lives needs to be enough.": "Jessica",
  "I think that the ideal of parenting can make people unhappy. It's that this lie that they're being told by society that parenting is one thing - and when parenting is something completely different - that's what makes them unhappy.": "Jessica",
  "How pleasant it is for a father to sit at his child's board. It is like an aged man reclining under the shadow of an oak which he has planted.": "Walter",
  "Whether I'm running, working, relating, parenting, learning - whatever I'm doing, I want to surround myself with people who push me.": "Kristin",
  "I'm not the first to admit that raising a child in Park Slope, Brooklyn, can bear an embarrassing resemblance to the TV show 'Portlandia.' My wife and I try to have some ironic distance from the culture of organic, chemical-free parenting, but we're often participants.": "Adam",
  "I realize that of all people, I am no expert on parenting or marriage.": "Mika",
  "My parenting style is probably like that of my parents, because you do how you learn. My mother was very nurturing and loving, but very stern. She was a disciplinary. My dad was also very loving.": "Kym",
  "Slow parents understand that childrearing should not be a cross between a competitive sport and product-development. It is not a project it's a journey. Slow parenting is about giving kids lots of love and attention with no conditions attached. ": "Carl",
  "Smaller families mean we have more time and money to lavish on each child. Parents are more anxious because small families give them less experience of parenting and put their genetic eggs in fewer baskets.": "Carl",
  "In my career as a writer, I preferred to avoid current events: I wrote young adult novels and book reviews and lifestyle journalism about health and parenting and other such evergreens.": "Laura",
  "I take my children everywhere, but they always find their way back home.": "Robert",
  "Never raise your hand to your children - it leaves your midsection unprotected.": "Robert",
  "I take parenting incredibly seriously. I want to be there for my kids and help them navigate the world, and develop skills, emotional intelligence, to enjoy life, and I'm lucky to be able to do that and have two healthy, normal boys.": "Joan",
  "The way I was parented did affect my parenting - probably in the reverse. My dad was pretty strict, and the next generation probably wants to be less strict.": "Alan",
  "For decades, parents were told by so-called parenting 'experts' that offspring would be best raised on the belief each is special and entitled to all life has to offer.": "Bob",
  "Most people who have grown up introverted in this very extroverted culture of ours have had painful experiences of feeling like they are out of step with what's expected of them. Parenting can pose unique challenges for introverted parents, who fear that their own painful experiences will be repeated in their children's lives.": "Susan",
  "I grew up with no money. My kids will grow up with a lot of money and so it's really important to me, and it will always be a part of my parenting, to keep them conscientious and connected socially to other people.": "Ryan",
  "We expect teachers to handle teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, and the failings of the family. Then we expect them to educate our children.": "John",
  "I don't claim to know everything about parenting, but I do know parents do their children a disservice by constantly sugarcoating their shortcomings to protect their feelings.": "LZ",
  "So, you know, parenting is a very intimate and amazing experience and one of the best experiences of my life.": "Uma",
  "Offering unequal leaves just reinforces the longstanding notion that parenting responsibilities aren't equal, and that doesn't help anyone.": "Christine",
  "No work-family balance will ever fully take hold if the social conditions that might make it possible - men who are willing to share parenting and housework, communities that value work in the home as highly as work on the job, and policymakers and elected officials who are prepared to demand family-friendly reforms - remain out of reach.": "Arlie",
  "In response to our fast-food culture, a 'slow food' movement appeared. Out of hurried parenthood, a move toward slow parenting could be growing. With vital government supports for state-of-the-art public child care and paid parental leave, maybe we would be ready to try slow love and marriage.": "Arlie",
  "I have three daughters, so I can't be as tough as I want to be. When you have kids - especially daughters - they know how to work you. They're a lot smarter than we are, that's for sure. But I'll be more tough on their boyfriends.": "Tim",
  "I can only speak for my husband and myself, but we don't feel like we could do any of this parenting without our faith.": "Jodi",
  "Some have said that 'Frankenstein' is a story of a bad parenting giving rise to a troubled child.": "Dave",
  "There's nothing to be gained, and much to be lost, in trying to bend every child to match a one-size-fits-all notion of what it means to be a boy or girl of a specific age. Better to set a few parameters and then go with the flow. Call it 'jazz parenting.'": "Ezekiel",
  "My father was a farmer and my mother was a farmer, but, my childhood was very good. I am very grateful for my childhood, because it was full of gladness and good humanity.": "Roberto",
  "There are 80 million moms in the United States. Forty million stay at home with their children.": "Andrew",
  "I learned that life is about the people around you and the people you give back to. That's what parenting is: You're not there for yourself you're there for your offspring and everyone else around you. ": "Conrad",
  "Mom and Dad would stay in bed on Sunday morning, but the kids would have to go to church.": "Lynn",
  "You have to support your children to have a healthy relationship.": "Connie",
  "I'm doing a lot of parenting work and acting as a spokesperson. I have a clothing line and a line of toys.": "Josie",
  "If there is any truth to my parenting the dreamwork movement, it comes from the power of the press.": "Henry",
  "We all, as parents, are laughing at ourselves and helicopter parenting and saying, 'This isn't the way we were parented; we were allowed to run free.' When I talk to my friends, we are all fascinated by what we are doing, but we can't seem to stop ourselves.": "Liane",
  "Being a father of three children and grandfather to nine, I do think that this thing called 'parenting' is becoming increasingly difficult.": "Craig",
  "Believe me, my children have more stamina than a power station.": "Robbie",
  "Becoming a mother has been the best thing ever for me. It's become my life's work. Not just parenting, but sharing information and encouraging other women to be receptive to the basic nature of motherhood.": "Anna",
  "You can make sure your kids make their beds and hang up their clothes and put their dishes in the dishwasher when you're the one calling the shots. So, parenting alone, for me anyway, I think is almost easier, being single.": "Jane",
  "For me, conscious parenting is staying attuned to your child, being really open and in the moment. It means staying as present as possible in your own breath for the betterment of your whole family.": "Anna",
  "Parenting is not just about you and your kid it's also about whomever you're parenting your child with. So there is a kind of 'awareness' involved for everybody. It's all about the way you interact with your child and participate in your child's life. ": "Anna",
  "Children that are raised in a home with a married mother and father consistently do better in every measure of well-being than their peers who come from divorced or step-parent, single-parent, cohabiting homes.": "Todd",
  "In parenting, as in judging, the days are long, but the years are short.": "Don",
  "I come from a dysfunctional family, so my views of parents and parenting used to be highly mixed.": "Tamora",
  "Single parenting is sometimes just a case of sitting around by yourself in mild despair, not knowing what to do.": "Simon",
  "I suppose it's amazing how quick life goes by when you have children.": "Steffi",
  "Dad was a strict disciplinarian and would give us a wallop with a wooden spoon if we were out of order. But we really respected him - he didn't try to be our best friend.": "Stephen",
  "I'm endlessly fascinated by parenting, marriage, my wife and the ins and outs of marriage.": "Rob",
  "It's really hard to figure out what they need to know. And that's parenting, in general. It's hard to figure out what would benefit your kids and what would just make them needlessly frightened.": "John",
  "I'm a parent, especially when you've had the intense parenting the way I had. It's all in the bank. It's all in the great experience bank. Those are your secrets. That's the stuff that makes your work rich, that's what you dip into.": "Hector",
  "Parents forgive their children least readily for the faults they themselves instilled in them.": "Marie",
  "My father wasn't really involved and my mom is the light in my life.": "Marion",
  "There's really no point in having children if you're not going to be home enough to father them.": "Anthony",
  "For me, Twitter works best as a way of taking pictures of being stuck in traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge. If people really want to read really funny quips about life, parenting, and pop culture, then by all means read Michael Ian Black's tweets.": "Michael",
  "When I was a kid, my mother's parenting style teetered between benign neglect and intense bouts of violence.": "Ariel",
  "It's difficult to keep that perspective, I think, as a parent: to know your boundaries as to what's good parenting or just projecting your own expectations on your kids. That's the hardest.": "Anthony",
  "Fathers and mothers have lost the idea that the highest aspiration they might have for their children is for them to be wise... specialized competence and success are all that they can imagine.": "Allan",
  "I wasn't very good about juggling family and my career. I was interested in who was coming to the children's birthday party, what my son was writing. I was thinking about Legos.": "Jill",
  "We criticize mothers for closeness. We criticize fathers for distance. How many of us have expected less from our fathers and appreciated what they gave us more? How many of us always let them off the hook?": "Ellen",
  "Parenting classes should be mandatory, whether you are adopting or not, and would include an evaluation of your current physical, mental and financial state as well as how ready you are to take on the rigors of parenthood. Our children are our most precious natural resource, and there is absolutely no other way to parent but to put them first.": "Dale",
  "As a rule, I try to steer clear of opinions pertaining to your parenting. I assume you're doing the best you can, and God bless.": "Emma",
  "A parentologist is a person who writes a book about parenting that is very clear about answers to, 'How am I supposed to raise my child?' Some of these well-intentioned people may be a bit too sure-footed on the sometimes slippery slope of parenting.": "Clyde",
  "No one knows his true character until he has run out of gas, purchased something on the installment plan and raised an adolescent.": "Marcelene",
  "Parents learn a lot from their children about coping with life.": "Muriel",
  "It is a sad commentary of our times when our young must seek advice and counsel from 'Dear Abby' instead of going to Mom and Dad.": "Pauline",
  "Edith Vonnegut behaved like a guest in her children's lives. To her way of thinking, parenting came under the general heading of household tasks, which, as a wealthy woman, she could pay others to do.": "Charles",
  "I had three children while doing a show, as demanding as 'Good Morning America,' so this is - you know, it's almost like I'm less daunted about motherhood, and parenting at this point in time. And I think I'm just much more fit and healthy than I was 20-years-ago.": "Joan",
  "My father once said about being a parent that it is the only thing you do that requires a very long period of learning, and at about the time that you are becoming competent, you don't need the skills anymore. Notwithstanding this modest assessment of their parenting skills, they were wonderful parents.": "Michael",
  "Family life was wonderful. The streets were bleak. The playgrounds were bleak. But home was always warm. My mother and father had a great relationship. I always felt 'safe' there.": "Robert",
  "Parenting a pre-teen is quite something.": "Melissa",
  "I'm hosting weekend retreats all over America. It is like a 24-hour slumber party for moms. We laugh, eat, play games, get massages, win prizes, talk about parenting and even cry a bit.": "Lisa",
  "My kids love it. I thought I was the coolest dad in the world when I got to be in a Bond film, but 'Harry Potter', too? Well, I think I qualify for a medal for exceptional parenting or something, don't you?": "Robbie",
  "I have this blanket thing about giving parenting advice to parents, and that's: 'Don't take other people's advice on parenting.'": "Drew",
  "Some men don't want to be responsible fathers. It's easier to say 'Let's just turn the kids over to the state.' Women end up bearing the entire load, raising kids alone without a husband to share the parenting.": "Tim",
  "My mother was the influence in my life. She was strong she had great faith in the ultimate triumph of justice and hard work. She believed passionately in education. ": "John",
  "I'd just as soon stay home and raise babies.": "June",
  "I think letting babies cry it out is barbaric. Why would parenting stop when it's dark outside? You can't expect a baby to know that he's supposed to sleep just because we want to go to bed.": "Holly",
  "I'm not a parenting expert by any means, but I've been interviewing and writing about kids for almost 20 years.": "Nancy",
  "We are apt to forget that children watch examples better than they listen to preaching.": "Roy",
  "I get whatever placidity I have from my father. But my mother taught me how to take it on the chin.": "Norma",
  "I really like 'Shameless' because it brings up important issues, but we get to talk and laugh and look at something that's really important that's a problem, like alcoholism and bad parenting. It's done in a funny, smart way.": "Justin",
  "A lot of kids have parents who say, 'Music is hard; maybe you should come up with a Plan B.' Whenever I hear that kind of 'advice,' I think it's bad parenting. I was lucky to have a parent who assured me it was a possibility to pursue music.": "Gerald",
  "Parents are key when it comes to keeping kids off drugs. Good parenting is the best anti-drug we have.": "Mel",
  "Being a mother of two myself - and two small girls - I think that single parenting is hard.": "Sarah",
  "Having a baby changes the way you view your in-laws. I love it when they come to visit now. They can hold the baby and I can go out.": "Matthew",
  "The more we learn, the more we will be confronted with decisions that we've never had to make before about life, about death, about parenting.": "Riccardo",
  "I think a generation ago, dads went to work, they came home, and they had their dinner, had a drink, and then went to bed. I don't know what it was like in your house, but that is how it was in mine. I think it is cool to have the dads in the trenches and doing the real parenting work.": "Zach",
  "Being cool is being your own self, not doing something that someone else is telling you to do.": "Vanessa",
  "Keep a cool head and maintain a low profile. Never take the lead - but aim to do something big.": "Deng",
  "My key to dealing with stress is simple: just stay cool and stay focused.": "Ashton",
  "My sister is my little star, and I'm excited for her and proud of her. With her, I'm protective, but also I don't want to be that sister who's really pushy and thinks they know everything and making her feel like she doesn't know what she's doing. I'm trying to be that cool older sister and not the mom, but it's hard.": "Gigi",
  "It's cool to be different and just be who you are and shock people in a good way.": "Brendon",
  "Nothing is cooler and more attractive than a big comeback, and that'll be me.": "Steven",
  "I'm a mirror. If you're cool with me, I'm cool with you, and the exchange starts. What you see is what you reflect. If you don't like what you see, then you've done something. If I'm standoffish, that's because you are.": "Jay-Z",
  "I'm not the kind of person who tries to be cool or trendy, I'm definitely an individual.": "Leonardo",
  "I think it's cool to be smart, and I think it's sexy to be smart.": "Stacey",
  "I don't want to be just known for the way I dress. I want to be known for how I play, how I treat people, and how I am as a role model. I don't just want to be, 'He dresses cool' or 'He dresses crazy.' You're going to have lovers and haters. I want my golf game to be the main thing.": "Rickie",
  "Keep a cool head and a warm heart.": "Mike",
  "Picking a best friend who stands up for what she believes in, is true to herself and allows you to be yourself without judgement of how 'cool' you are? Well, now you're picking a friend for life.": "Renee",
  "It's so important to realize that every time you get upset, it drains your emotional energy. Losing your cool makes you tired. Getting angry a lot messes with your health.": "Joyce",
  "What people don't understand is joining a gang ain't bad, it's cool, it's fine. When you in the hood, joining a gang it's cool because all your friends are in the gang, all your family's in the gang. We're not just killing people every night, we're just hanging out, having a good time.": "Snoop",
  "My mom is just someone who's easy to talk to and hang with. My sister, it's always cool to be able to help her out with things. My brother is fun when we're just joking and messing around. And my dad is someone who's helpful with my music and easy to talk to about that stuff because he understands me in that sense.": "David",
  "I think I'm cool. That's all that matters.": "Tyler,",
  "I think fashion is a lot of fun. I love clothes. More than fashion or brand labels, I love design. I love the thought that people put into clothes. I love when clothes make cultural statements and I think personal style is really cool. I also freely recognize that fashion should be a hobby.": "Anne",
  "I don't think of myself as hot or cool or anything, just a dork.": "Ashley",
  "I want to be a vampire. They're the coolest monsters.": "Gerard",
  "Cell phones, mobile e-mail, and all the other cool and slick gadgets can cause massive losses in our creative output and overall productivity.": "Robin",
  "Jazz is smooth and cool. Jazz is rage. Jazz flows like water. Jazz never seems to begin or end. Jazz isn't methodical, but jazz isn't messy either. Jazz is a conversation, a give and take. Jazz is the connection and communication between musicians. Jazz is abandon.": "Nat",
  "Good words cool more than cold water.": "John",
  "To create well I have to be in a good mood, happy and cool.": "Marc",
  "I'm cute - and God I hate that. Because that's not cool. I'm like your niece, and nobody wants to date their niece. It's the chubby cheeks. The whole reason people voted for me on American Idol is because I'm an everyday, normal girl.": "Kelly",
  "I wear sunglasses almost all the time outside - not because I think I'm really, really cool, but because of the rays.": "Ronda",
  "I think when you are a cool guy but also a hot guy, that makes you even more sexy.": "Tessanne",
  "Rockets are cool. There's no getting around that.": "Elon",
  "I try to explain to people that the only way to be cool is to be who you truly are, and the only way to live life is to do the things that you want to do and be the person that you want to be no matter who that is or what that is or how you have to do it. That's the only way you can be genuinely happy.": "Tucker",
  "Music is music, ultimately. If it makes you feel good, cool.": "Prince",
  "For cool things to happen, you have to get out of your comfort zone.": "Rony",
  "I am a bit of a bad boy. I have tattoos and I mess around. That's part of my image, so it's cool.": "Zayn",
  "My main focus is to always try to be myself first, and then, hey, if I wear a cool jacket, that's a bonus.": "John",
  "For me, the cool thing is doing things that could only be done in gaming.": "Warren",
  "A full beard looks cool.": "Richard",
  "I never cut class. I loved getting A's, I liked being smart. I liked being on time. I thought being smart is cooler than anything in the world.": "Michelle",
  "I suppose being fierce is a very good thing, and a very cool thing. But more than fierce, I think I'm a strong person and a strong individual. And that's what I take with me every day.": "Johnny",
  "Rhyme patterns are nothing without meanings to the words. A lot of rappers can do those flows, but the raps aren't really about anything - which is cool sometimes, but to have the flow and the message is one of my favorite things.": "J.",
  "I like low-maintenance girls, but at the same time, classy. She needs to take care of herself. But also be a girl who isn't afraid to get sweaty and play basketball, so it's cool if she's a tomboy.": "Chris",
  "Rather be dead than cool.": "Kurt",
  "The cool thing about being famous is traveling. I have always wanted to travel across seas, like to Canada and stuff.": "Britney",
  "My biggest thing about being a role model is whatever I'm preaching, I'm practicing. If I'm telling people I'm boxing and then I'm eating a burger tonight, it's because I am. I'm not cheating and eating a salad and then being like, 'Yeah! Burgers are cool!'": "Gigi",
  "If you've got cool nails, you wake up and you're like, 'Oh, I'm happy now.'": "Maisie",
  "Remember the first time you went to a show and saw your favorite band. You wore their shirt, and sang every word. You didn't know anything about scene politics, haircuts, or what was cool. All you knew was that this music made you feel different from anyone you shared a locker with. Someone finally understood you. This is what music is about.": "Gerard",
  "I'm cool with failing so long as I know that there are people around me that love me unconditionally.": "Dave",
  "There's something cool about being a stealth classic.": "John",
  "November is auspicious in so many parts of the country: the rice harvest is already in, the weather starts to cool, and the festive glow which precedes Christmas has began to brighten the landscape.": "F.",
  "My personal style falls between casual cool and meticulous slob. I'm most comfortable in jeans, but I love fashion.": "Reid",
  "What I think is so amazing about having everything, and feeling like I have everything, is that I don't really find happiness within materialistic things. Like, it's cool if I can buy myself a new car, and I think it's amazing for a week, but then the thrill is over, and I'm like, 'Oh, so I guess that wasn't really happiness.'": "Kylie",
  "People look at me and see a calm, cool guy on the sidelines and I want them to know that my Christian faith affects my coaching and everything I do.": "Tony",
  "It's the most gratifying thing to have young girls telling me, 'I love that you do a photo shoot in pants and a button up shirt, and you still look cool.'": "AJ",
  "I think you have to be cool to be a good flirt, and I don't think I'm very cool.": "Harry",
  "I'm never quite cool, if you know what I mean. I'm basically the worst, best superhero.": "Tom",
  "Black and awkward is the worst, because black people are stereotyped as being anything but awkward in mainstream media... Black people are always portrayed to be cool or overly dramatic, anything but awkward.": "Issa",
  "Racism is taught in the home. We agree on that? Well, it's very hard to teach racism to a teenager who's listening to rap music and who idolizes, say, Snoop Dogg. It's hard to say, 'That guy is less than you.' The kid is like, 'I like that guy, he's cool. How is he less than me?": "Jay-Z",
  "Sometimes just when I say hello the right way, I'm like, 'Whoa, I'm so cool.'": "Robert",
  "The Internet is for haters. Everyone wants to knock somebody down, but it's cool.": "Andy",
  "When I hit 16, I got a scooter to ride to school. It was bright pink, and I saw on the ownership papers that Jonathan Ross once owned it. My friends slated me for it because of the colour, but it was cool. My father used to ride, and my mother's boyfriend has a bike, so we're a bit of a biker family.": "Thomas",
  "Saturday morning, you knew what was cool by what was on 'Soul Train.'": "Nick",
  "The cool parts - the parts that have won Dubai its reputation as 'the Vegas of the Middle East' or 'the Venice of the Middle East' or 'the Disney World of the Middle East, if Disney World were the size of San Francisco and out in a desert' - have been built in the last ten years.": "George",
  "I kinda see everyone as competition. I'm a very competitive person. But I think that's good. Competition is great. And as long as it's friendly and not a malicious thing, then I think it's cool.": "Janet",
  "Sometimes it's okay to give yourself a pat on the back and say, 'That was cool. That made me feel good.'": "Sebastian",
  "The thing that I think a lot of guys need to know how to do is not take your mother's advice about honesty being the best policy. Listen to your cool, drunk uncle who tells you to lie. Those are the relationships that last.": "Adam",
  "I'm not the biggest motorcycle fan - they're cool and a lot of fun, but they're scary as well!": "Taylor",
  "Is a hippopotamus a hippopotamus, or just a really cool Opotamus?": "Mitch",
  "Me and my dad are friends. We're cool. I'll never be disappointed again, because I don't expect anything anymore from him. I just let him exist, and that's how we get along.": "Drake",
  "I still have my school friends who are actually friends. It's nice that they don't think much about my singing career. They think it is cool, and they are happy for me, but they don't really bother me about it. To them, I'm still just the schoolgirl from next door.": "Jackie",
  "I like cool jackets - a nice fall or winter coat. You can get a lot of use out of it, and you'll wear it frequently, so it can really set the tone of your uniform for the season.": "John",
  "I definitely move to the beat of my own drummer and man, he's not playing something anyone has heard before. It's pretty cool, though. Pretty cool.": "Q-Tip",
  "Growing up, I didn't feel cool; I didn't fit into any crowd.": "Madonna",
  "I try to be cool with everybody, but sometimes, everybody just has different personalities, motives, and different characters.": "Tyga",
  "There aren't many things that are universally cool, and it's cool not to litter. I'd never do it.": "Matthew",
  "If your stomach disputes you, lie down and pacify it with cool thoughts.": "Satchel",
  "I used to listen to 'Perfect Day' by Hoku every single day in high school! 'On this perfect day, nothin' standin' in my way... Don't you try to rain on my perfect day.' It pumped me up when I was feeling down or defeated, whether it was from the cool kids making me feel left out or feeling overwhelmed with homework and mean teachers.": "Kara",
  "Whatever hysteria exists is inflamed by mystery, suspicion and secrecy. Hard and exact facts will cool it.": "Elia",
  "You can think of Hollywood as high school. TV actors are freshmen, comedy actors are maybe juniors, and dramatic actors - they're the cool seniors.": "Owen",
  "I haven't experienced anything paranormal yet, but I did see what I think was a meteor light up the sky in a flash of red for a few seconds. That was really cool.": "Ryan",
  "It's cool to be a part of recovery. This is just who I am, this is what I write about, what I do, and most of my work has been a reflection of what I've been going through in one way or another.": "Chester",
  "I'm a geeky toy collector, and to have toys of your own characters is unbelievably cool.": "Craig",

  "I like to look cool and dress nice. Lil Uzi is a rock star. Just know that.": "Lil",
  "I don't count on the boy who waits till October, when it's cool and fun, then decides he wants to play.": "Darrell",
  "Obviously anything that accessorizes or enhances the iPhone is always pretty cool.": "Harry",
  "Pink is my favourite colour. I used to say my favourite colour was black to be cool, but it is pink - all shades of pink. If I have an accessory, it is probably pink.": "Roxane",
  "You show up in Paris, and on the drive from the airport to the hotel you're like, 'This is so cool! I want to see something! I want to go to the Eiffel Tower!' And then you leave the next morning.

  "I'm just a cool type of guy who's all about positives.": "Big",
  "It's cool when people know you more, but I like people to treat me regular when they see me. I take pictures. I don't really be big on people looking at me.": "Meek",
  "I think I'm commercial underground. I'm not commercial in the way that people consider 'pop,' but I'm not underground in the way that people consider that. either. I am just a cool guy.": "Tiesto",
  "I think making friends is not being afraid to look stupid, because everyone wants a friend who is willing to be stupid and fun. If you try and be too cool, it only works in high school. After that, being uncool is a very cool thing to do. So just have fun, and don't worry what other people think of you and people will want to be your friends.": "Adam",
  "I've built a network that curates interestingness. In my universe, it encompasses thousands and thousands of filters and people, each person being a filter. So it's kinda cool. Like I've created my own utopia, removing the boring stuff and showing only the amazing stuff.": "Jason",
  "In the Middle East in the summertime, to keep cool, a lot of people sleep on the rooftops.": "Daron",
  "Sketching in general - anywhere, not just in Gitmo, but in life, in the world - is a profoundly disruptive act. Because you're creating something when you're kind of expected to consume or sit passively. I've always sketched things as a way to get into them, whether it was a fancy nightclub or, you know, to have kids think I was cool, whatever.": "Molly",
  "I do love Instagram, and my kids are with me, like, 24-7, so it's inevitable that they'll be on there. And honestly, I know it sounds weird, but I look up people all the time on it. Because I find people so interesting, and I'm curious about them. It's a gateway to meet new people. I think the whole concept of Instagram is really cool.": "Britney",
  "I'd rather be the cool aunt than the authoritative aunt.": "Solange",

  "As a young boy, I was taught in high school that hacking was cool.": "Kevin",
  "My perfect guy wears converse, is totally laid back, and doesn't worry about being cool.": "Selena",
  "Jazz took too much discipline. You have to come in at the right place, which is different than me singing the blues, where I can sing, 'Oh, baby,' if there's a pause in the melody. With jazz, you better leave that space open, or put in something real cool.": "Etta",
  "When you're writing, you're only a brain and some fingers, but drumming, you're involving all four limbs, and you're hearing stuff and you're converting your ideas into physical motions, getting physical feedback from things you are touching - it's pretty cool. It's a really a nice contrast to writing.": "Michael",
  "My mom gave me enough self-worth to carry me through difficult experiences. She was very loving and accepting. She was like, 'Whelp, you're gay? OK, cool.'": "Jillian",

  "I never saw music in terms of men and women or black and white. There was just cool and uncool.": "Bonnie",
  "I wanted to escape Small Town U.S.A. To dismiss the boundaries, to explore. My life experience came from watching movies, TV, and reading books and magazines.

  "I think all jocks have a sensitive side. It's just, will they show it to anybody? Will they let their guard down and stop being tough and the cool jock guy around their friends, or just relax?

  "These days it's cool to be ethnic and to be different, but when I was a kid, it was not cool - at all. My friends would come over and my mom would make crepes with eggs, stuffed with mozzarella cheese, tomatoes and spinach. And they'd be like, 'What is this?'": "Giada",
  "The cool thing about reading is that when you read a short story or you read something that takes your mind and expands where your thoughts can go, that's powerful.": "Taylor",

  "I'm cool with the way I look, I'm not an ugly dog, but I don't see myself as a stud or anything.": "Seann",
  "My Barbies were usually naked. Once, I took their heads off, cut their hair, drew on their short, spiky hair with some markers, then stuck the heads on Christmas lights.

  "It's cool to be healthy.": "Dick",
  "In my hometown there is a pub named after me - The Frome Flyer on Jenson Avenue. How cool is that?!": "Jenson",
  "I've always been scared of advertising folk. I've met them at parties and I've been to their offices and I've always found them intimidatingly cool. At one company I visited, they held their meetings in a caravan that had somehow been installed in the place, a rather more exotic place to gather than the typical BBC glass box.": "Evan",
  "It was just an idea I had, that it could be cool to have a book covered in fake fur.": "Dave",

  "Being in love is not cool!": "Alice",
  "When you think back to your first kiss, your hair is perfect and she was wearing a cool outfit. We remember it with restraint and we remember it with style. We remember it as idealistically as you can think.": "Stephen",
  "I have visualizations where I'm living in a really cool place - probably outside of town - with a really dope studio where I can record music or film things. Just have my own mini production house. That's really the thing I'd love to end up with the most and only do gigs when I needed to and also amass a little bit of a crew around me.": "Reggie",
  "I want to speak up and tell you that mascara and clothes don't make you cool, neither do name-brand handbags, but being a leader can.": "Renee",
  "I would love to work with Marion Cotillard... and my sister! I've never worked with Dakota before in a movie. It'd be so cool to be on screen interacting with each other one day. It will happen, I'm just not sure when.": "Elle",
  "I'm a girl's girl. I'm a woman's woman. I'm a cool girl.": "Kimora",
  "Maybe the coolest people are the ones who don't care about being cool.": "Steve",

  "I'm cool with Jay-Z. Jay-Z is genuinely my friend.": "Drake",
  "I had a couple of really cool friends when I was a kid, and we'd find cool music and movies and show them to each other.

I was sleeping over his house - and I think we were literally 15 - and we watched it.": "Gerard",
  "You've got to be strong enough for love. It's very easy to be cool and cynical. It's very difficult to just let yourself go and be in love. You've got to be strong enough for that.": "Noel",
  "I really want to do a film in another language. My dad's from Germany, so it'd be really cool to do a film in German. I'm not quite fluent, but I can get there. And my accent's pretty good. I wouldn't feel too out of my element.": "Kirsten",
  "I'm glad to see that BMW is bringing an electric car to market. That's cool.": "Elon",
  "Unwanted honking not only irritates others, but may also end up causing accidents. Drivers lose cool and it may result in road rage.": "Rahul",
  "I've done a road trip across Italy with a girlfriend, and that was very romantic. I think that road trips are probably one of the romantic things you can do. To take your girlfriend and just stay wherever; don't have a destination and just drive and see where the road takes you is pretty cool.": "Christopher",
  "I go from English to Spanish, and I feel I have some cool songs.": "Enrique",
  "I once asked Ozzy Osbourne, truly one of my favorite people in the world, if he was cool with singing Black Sabbath songs year after year, whether he was performing with Black Sabbath or out on a solo tour. He said it was great.": "Henry",
  "As far as putting stuff on social media, I think Instagram is really cool because I like the visual aspect. You're taking pictures, and you can put a filter on them, and it's super creative.": "Ross",
  "I love to hear a cool ambient sound at runway shows. It creates a good energy.": "Theophilus",
  "When I have a good pair of shoes, I wear them over and over. Whether it's nice sneakers or a cool pair of combat boots, splurge on a pair you love that you can wear over and over with totally different outfits.": "Bethany",
  "I'm born and raised in Mexico. I only spent eight months in the States, but definitely English is a really big part of my life, and I love it. Thank God my mom put me in American school because I'm able to be working in the States, and it opens a lot more doors being half and not being only one. It's cool because I get to turn it on and off.": "Eiza",
  "I don't follow anything that's said about him much, but the Uwe Boll that I know is just a really cool guy. He's just a really quiet, kind and passionate filmmaker who really believes in what he's doing. Like any director that an actor wants to work with, you want a director who's passionate and believes in the work that he's doing.": "Michael",
  "If kids can have some sort of social responsibility, that's cool. But if they're not actually having social responsibility, and they're kind of hiding behind it, that's kind of useless, or even worse.": "Diplo",
  "I feel like my style's always been influenced by 'less is more.' The coolest styles are kind of simple and classic, like a white T-shirt and jeans. Maybe you have a cool belt and cool shoes, but everything else you keep simple.": "Chris",
  "When I am working on a book or a story, I write every morning as soon after first light as possible. There is no one to disturb you, and it is cool or cold, and you come to your work and warm as you write.": "Ernest",
  "Fashion is really a place where every other industry connects, whether it's music or acting. At the end of the day, everyone is going to walk the red carpet and be interested in the fashion side of it. I think that's really cool because as a model, you get to connect with a lot of different worlds.": "Gigi",
  "I guess I've always been a groupie. My first date was a bull rider called Tommy Lee Bryant. We'd go to the rodeo every Saturday and Sunday. The bull riders were the cool guys.": "Jerry",
  "Just sharing music with each other - that's cool. It's the selling that becomes the problem.": "Prince",

  "The last game I played in college was in the NIT against St. Mary's. That was the first time I had come to the Oakland area. So, the last game I played in college and the first game of my NBA career were out here in the Bay Area. It's pretty cool.": "Stephen",
  "My favorite was the one about 'Snow White'. Those funky little guys with the beards. The poisonous apple. And that cool mirror the evil stepmother used to talk to. You know, she'd ask it all these questions: Who's the nicest? Who's the sweetest... Who's the fairest of them all? And for a while, everything was hunky-dory.": "Kathi",
  "Me and my buddies are all like brothers. So it's okay for us to say 'I love you' or whatever. It's always cool. I think that comes from my dad. That's just the way he always was.": "Paul",
  "When I'm singing, it's a mixture of my innocence in the projects, my mom and dad. It's all the good and the bad, the laughs and the frowns that I went through and seen other people go through. Then you be trying to write it. Whatever's coming out, you try and make it all cool.": "Aaron",
  "Being a sex symbol isn't cool unless you're in love with a girl, and she calls you a sex symbol.": "Shawn",
  "This was something I always dreamed and wanted to be part of, when women's wrestling was freakin' cool, and now it is.": "Becky",
  "Accessories are key - nothing beats a cool Panama hat or statement shades - look to Maison Michel or Miu Miu for inspiration.": "Poppy",
  "Living my life socially means there is a swagger to how I dress, walk; it's not about being 'cool,' it's just being me - that's understanding your place and your center - that's what swagger is, and I guess that's where the soul comes from.": "BJ",
  "Drake is an amazing person. Also, a magician. He's a big brother, super-talent; he's cool.": "Travis",
  "The Internet made fame wack and anonymity cool.": "Frank",
  "What's really cool about LEGOs is that you can put a bunch of bricks on the table, and everybody will make something different. Everyone has different ideas, and some of them may seem crazy.": "Christopher",
  "The worst thing I could be thinking is how could I be a cool bass player.": "Mike",
  "I'm more into the Spawn toys. They're really cool. They're coming out with a Techno Spawn series and another series, The Dark Ages, which are really cool.": "Jason",
  "Everyone is different, but I'm not standoffish at all. I'm not one of those people who prefer to write a note. I'll walk right up to you and ask you out! Even if the answer's no, I'm totally cool with it.": "Corbin",
  "When people recognise me they just kind of go 'Hi how are you,' really kind of cool you know.": "Rachel",
  "Americans are cool; if you show just a chink of vulnerability, they respond so much. They'll pat you on the arm and say, 'Hey kid, you're all right.' Brits will respond but they are much more cynical.": "Bear",
  "I'm not Rihanna. I'm not cool. When people come up to me in the street, they often want a hug, not a photo, and they want that because they like my work.": "Anne",
  "I went to high school, and I started getting bullied because I was very weird. I mean, freshman year I went to school in a pirate suit - I just didn't care. I'm not like the cool girls - I'm the other girl. The one that's basically a nerd, but proud of that.": "Lele",
  "I went to a public school through sixth grade, and being good at tests wasn't cool.": "Bill",
  "That's the thing about Aquaman that's cool is he's not an alien, right? He's from our planet, and he's from a society that we're not privy to in the context of the story.": "James",
  "The Tom Brady sandwich would be a prosciutto with a nice Buffalo mozzarella, on a crispy baguette with a little fresh basil. Brady is classy; he's a really cool dude. He's got a lot of flavor.": "Guy",
  "I created 'Rookie' because I read a lot of websites that I thought were cool and interesting, but they weren't for teens, and I wanted us to have something that could be ours.": "Tavi",

  "I think it's cool that London Fashion Week is about young designers trying wacky things.": "Alexa",
  "'Boyz-n-the-Hood' was actually supposed to be written for Eazy's group. He had a group out in New York called Home Boys Only, called HBO. One of them looked like LL Cool J. Eazy wanted to write a song for them, a street song, like what we were doing on the mix tapes. So when I wrote it, it was too West Coast for them.": "Ice",
  "If you're doing this because you feel like you have a burning desire to do it, then you'll find a way to do it, no matter what. If you're doing this because you're thinking, 'Hey, this will be really cool. I'll be famous. I'll be on YouTube,' then you'll probably quit, because it's not easy to do for the long haul.": "Trisha",
  "Cyber attacks are not what makes the cool war 'cool.' As a strategic matter, they do not differ fundamentally from older tools of espionage and sabotage.": "Noah",
  "People in high school either feel like they're with the cool kids in a clique, or they're isolated - there's no in-between.": "Ross",
  "I was not a cool kid. There was no reason for me to be marginalised. I was just a nerd. I was kind of weird, and I found solace in video games.": "Kumail",
  "Tracy Morgan is subdued. I'm cool. I'm chilled out.": "Tracy",
  "Making a mix CD - albeit slightly old school - is generally a pretty cool gift and something I like to receive, or giving someone a book that moved you. Writing an inscription inside makes it even better.": "Ryan",
  "We do this basically for ourselves. People appreciate it, which is cool, but I think they appreciate that we're doing it for ourselves. We're doing it our way, and how people like it is not up to us. We like it.": "James",
  "It's a funny thing. I'll be in my home town of Columbus at a restaurant or something, and the waiter maybe asks, 'What do you do?' and I say, 'Oh, I'm in a band... Twenty One Pilots,' and he'll say, 'Cool, I'll check it out. I never heard of them.' And then I say, 'In September we're playing the Schottenstein Center,' and it's like, 'What?!'": "Tyler",
  "I always preferred to hang out with the outcasts, 'cause they were cooler; they had better taste in music, for one thing, I guess because they had more time to develop one with the lack of social interaction they had!": "John",
  "Keep cool anger is not an argument. ": "Daniel",
  "I just think it looks so cool when a woman has a dirty martini. She looks so powerful.": "Jillian",

  "Prince turned experimental music into pop music. 'When Doves Cry,' the whole 'Purple Rain' soundtrack - he was inspired by the Cocteau Twins and new wave pop and brought it into R&B when he first started, and then it became this cool, next-level, kind of hard-to-digest music. Which is what I felt 'House of Balloons' was.": "The",
  "You think aerobics is not a cool sport? I think you are wrong. It requires amazing discipline - flexibility, fitness, knowledge. And you have to do it with a big smile on your face. Also, I once performed in front of 10,000 screaming women. I tell you something, I'd rather do that than kick a ball around in front of a few men.": "Magnus",
  "When I was doing 'Smile,' I was looking back at pictures of myself and going, 'Thank goodness I couldn't do the sprayed-bangs thing! Everybody's so embarrassed by that hairstyle now, but I was never cool enough to pull it off!'": "Raina",
  "Reggae, oh man. It's the ultimate music. The positivity. The musicality. The whole cultural expressionism of it. The danceability. Just the cool factor. The melody factor. Some of it comes from a religious place. If there were a competition of who makes the best religious music, it would definitely be the Rastafarian reggae.": "Lupe",
  "I wish I was a cool guy and could drink coffee black, but I put almond milk and raw cane sugar in it.": "Nick",
  "My family lived off the land and summer evening meals featured baked stuffed tomatoes, potato salad, corn on the cob, fresh shelled peas and homemade ice cream with strawberries from our garden. With no air conditioning in those days, the cool porch was the center of our universe after the scorching days.": "David",
  "It's actually cool to be positive and optimistic and idealistic. It's cool to see yourself doing beautiful, great things.": "Tom",
  "It's just so cool when you meet people who are different than you are. That can give you a different perspective, a viewpoint on life, or inspire you. I mean, what would the world be like if we were all the same? I think it would be very boring.": "Ciara",
  "I wouldn't want to be Superman. Batman would be cool. But the one I've always wanted to play is the Joker. There is a maniacal and dangerous side to me.": "T.",

  "The battle to find a workplace that's wheelchair accessible is a feat in itself, let alone an employer who's going to be cool about employing someone with a disability in a job you actually want to do.": "Stella",
  "I'm like a big 10-year-old when I'm on stage. I just go up there and do whatever I think is cool at the moment.": "Tyler,",
  "I feel that we, as Indians, have a knack for loving a stereotypical, sobbing, sympathy-seeking personality. I feel that we need to promote quirky, cool and youthful talent. We have to stop propagating the sob-story angle of celebs, where they try to be larger-than-life. That is very outdated. It is so boring that it puts you to sleep.": "Kangana",
  "If we have a great idea, we'll go, 'Oh, this could be a cool movie.' Or really for us, it's more like, 'Oh, this is a really bad idea. Let's do this. This seems really stupid.'": "Trey",
  "Heroes don't wear diapers. It's just not cool.": "Felix",
  "I want kids of this generation to see that everything is cool, that there's some kind of unity in hip-hop. We all found something that's really important to us, and music is all we've really got.": "Missy",
  "I know that people think I'm sexy and I am looked at as that. It is cool with me. It's wonderful to have sexy appeal. If you embrace it, it can be a very beautiful thing.": "Aaliyah",

  "Survival, in the cool economics of biology, means simply the persistence of one's own genes in the generations to follow.": "Lewis",
  "No-one has ever called me a cool dude. I'm somewhere between geek and normal.": "Linus",

  "What's really cool about our family is that we don't hold grudges, and I think that is what's been the key to the success. We get into our little disagreements, and whether we're right or wrong, we'll go and apologize. That's just the way we are.": "Selena",
  "To act coolly, intelligently and prudently in perilous circumstances is the test of a man - and also a nation.": "Adlai",
  "My problem was that I was blond. There were no heroes with blond hair. Robert Taylor and Henry Fonda, they all had dark hair. The only one I found was Van Johnson, who wasn't too cool. He was a nice, homely American boy. So I created my own image. It worked.": "Michael",
  "Being uncool is being pretty much the coolest you can be.": "Rufus",
  "Music is for people. The word 'pop' is simply short for popular. It means that people like it. I'm just a normal jerk who happens to make music. As long as my brain and fingers work, I'm cool.": "Eddie",
  "I'm always drawing, so Draw Something is a cool game to play against your friends when you're bored and sat chilling out and relaxing.": "Zayn",
  "As far as rap goes, I grew up in Hollis, Queens, so early influences were people like Run DMC and LL Cool J.": "Ja",
  "I'm not trying to be this cool girl. If you're trying to be something you're not, it's slowly going to bite you in the butt.": "Bella",
  "It's the same with visual arts, you have some really cool, wonderful striking images that make you think and then again you have wonderful striking images that just take you away from the existing world for a second. And I like the latter a bit more.": "Ville",
  "I've been in fights, but that doesn't make me cool or like a tough guy or more interesting actor, I'm not proud of it.": "Shia",
  "When you're a kid, you see your parents reading the newspaper and you're like, 'God, why are they reading the newspaper?' When you're young, you're not reading the newspaper. But there comes a time in your life when the newspaper's cool.": "Fred",
  "Sure, climbing Mount Everest would be cool, but that's something I would now like to do as a family. Big experiences like that I don't want to have on my own anymore. I want to share them.": "Heidi",
  "We found out the Gemini spacesuit was, well, oxygen was flowing to keep me cool as well as to breathe, and it wasn't good enough. My visor got fogged.": "Eugene",
  "The funny thing is, the girls that I'm always up against for roles are pretty nice and cool, like Emma Watson. She's awesome.": "Amanda",
  "And we have a little herb garden, which survived the winter thanks to global warming. It makes me feel like a cool, old Italian housewife, that I kept my rosemary alive outside all winter.": "Elizabeth",
  "There's a gap between what I want to do, what I do on camera, and what gets edited. Right? So the goal is to try and close the gaps. What's the biggest compliment is if I read a review and it's exactly what I wrote down in my diary before ever filming it. That's really cool. That's the biggest signifier of closing the gaps.": "Matthew",
  "I used to love being the class clown. I loved to make jokes and make people laugh. There was a set of students who would find it funny. But the cool students were like, 'Eeew!'": "Issa",
  "One thing that has helped me to become patient and cool is that I grew up with sisters.": "William",
  "My mom is my best friend in the entire world. She is so cool and so inspiring. I've always been able to be open with her and talk to her as a friend.": "Jessica",
  "I'm not very cool. I have a really hard time meeting people and stuff.": "Taylor",
  "I always say, 'Hip-hop takes me everywhere.' It's crazy when I step onstage, and people might not speak much English, but they know every word to your songs. It's kind of freaky, but it's really cool.": "Eve",
  "Many in the world are searching, often intensely, for a source of refreshment that will quench their yearning for meaning and direction in their lives. They crave a cool, satisfying drink of insight and knowledge that will soothe their parched souls.": "Joseph",
  "You're going to be way happier doing what you actually love and finding other people that love the same thing than doing something that other people love so you're just cooler and you have cool friends.": "Afrojack",
  "It's going to be interesting to see how society deals with artificial intelligence, but it will definitely be cool.": "Colin",
  "I had my bad-boy moment in my teens. I'll never do that again. It wasn't pleasant, and I learned my lesson. It was sexy and mysterious, and it's like, 'Look how cool they are,' but it's just not worth it. He was lying to me and accusing me of cheating - but then I realized he was the one cheating.": "Jessica",
  "In this beginner-friendly book, called 'Learn to Program with Minecraft,' you will learn how to do cool things in Minecraft using the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is needed.": "Mark",
  "To me, a sure-fire way to get in a rut is by sitting around playing by yourself for too long. You've gotta get out there and jam, man! You don't have to necessarily be in a band, all you've gotta have are a couple of buds who play too. They don't have to be guitarists either; jamming with a bassist or a drummer is cool.": "Dimebag",
  "We may never be as big as WWE, but the cool thing about TNA is that we are the alternative. So people who get tired and bored with the WWE - I've been there, I understand - there's an alternative and something else to watch.": "Jeff",
  "I'm proud to be part of the fabric that inspires the next generations to remain curious and remember that 'smart is cool.'": "Walter",
  "I'm keeping the pixie. I hope I inspire people... it's really cool to have short hair.": "Millie",
  "I think when you're winning, your uniforms are cool.": "Shaun",
  "You know, you grow up with the image of John Travolta being super cool - 'Saturday Night Fever,' Brian De Palma, handsome young god... he, in reality, is a very silly man. And I mean that in a good way. He'll walk around the set talking in little weird voices, making people laugh.": "Eric",
  "With 'The Social Network,' I got into it at first because frankly I thought there was a cool courtroom drama to be had with the intellectual properties. And then what further drew me in was that the most extraordinary social networking device ever created was created by the world's most antisocial person. I liked that story.": "Aaron",
  "But this is Miami, you can't come to Miami and not show any skin. You gotta show something. If you're all covered up in this heat, you're gonna make me pass out out just to look at you. It's sweaty in Miami-but the diamonds will keep me cool.": "Lil'",
  "The thing about stand-up was, I was doing all this sketch and YouTube stuff where I was not being censored and I got to do my own thing, and it was really cool.": "Donald",
  "When you try to cool down hot emotions, what tends to happen is that you end up either repressing them or losing them altogether. Neither is desirable. Without emotion, much social interaction loses its meaning or changes for the worse.": "Julian",
  "At Tencent, we may be businessmen, but we are still chasing our IT, our science. We are still striving to create something really cool, trying to create things we couldn't even imagine without our new technologies. I am still clinging to this enthusiasm.": "Ma",
  "I like Kauffman Stadium in Kansas City. With the waterfall and things like that, I think it's pretty cool.": "CC",
  "Trajectories aren't linear. Life's just a roller coaster. If you're getting a chance to do cool stuff, and it's varied stuff, just enjoy it. I guess I'm a believer in the randomness of life rather than it being a linear trajectory or an arc, a consistent smooth arc, towards anything.": "Riz",
  "The simple truth is that balding African-American men look cool when they shave their heads, whereas balding white men look like giant thumbs.": "Dave",
  "I just tried to keep my cool and continue with my race plan: to win.": "Mark",
  "I don't go to the cool, trendy restaurants. I go to either the holes in the wall or the super-fancy restaurants where there are no cool people.": "Tyra",
  "I've never been cool - and I don't care.": "Celine",
  "I'm from Iowa, we don't know what cool is!": "Ashton",
  "And not only that, I also have the MacBook Air which is really cool. Even my wife is jealous of my MacBook Air.": "Karl",
  "I used to lie between cool, clean sheets at night after I'd had a bath, after I had washed my hair and scrubbed my knuckles and finger-nails and teeth. Then I could lie quite still in the dark with my face to the window with the trees in it, and talk to God.": "Frances",
  "The cool thing is that now that people have made this evolution where cooking is cool, people are doing it on weekends, they're doing their own challenges. It's back to cooking. And it's real cooking.": "Emeril",
  "In the Lamborghini I have to avoid certain roads because of pot holes, and there's nowhere to put my drink, no cup holder. And I'm not going to lie, it looks pretentious. I used to think it was cool to, like, drive it to dinner. Now? Like I really need to be looked at any more.": "Danica",
  "We're always bombarded with images from magazines of what looks cool and sexy.": "Marilu",
  "Sometimes life's so much cooler when you just don't know any better and all the painful lessons have not hammered your head open yet.": "Anthony",
  "An orange on the table, your dress on the rug, and you in my bed, sweet present of the present, cool of night, warmth of my life.": "Jacques",
  "I try not to name too many labels - not because it's not cool, but because it starts getting political.": "Nelly",
  "I shall go the way of the open sea, to the lands I knew before you came, and the cool ocean breezes shall blow from me the memory of your name.": "Adela",
  "It's cool to have critical success because it's always nice for your peers to say, 'Good job.' But who cares about them?": "Zac",
  "I was training more learning how to scuba dive which I'd never done which was really, really, really cool.": "Ashley",
  "Now, guitar was pretty cool. Everybody knew something on the guitar. So I wanted to play guitar, but I told my dad if he wanted me to keep studying something, I'd like to study piano.": "Jackson",
  "When Brian told me he grew up in New Mexico, I told him I thought it is cool that people from other countries play football. He corrected me on my geography and agreed to sit down with me anyway.": "Terry",
  "One of the great bands we opened up for was Priest back in '89. That was really great because at that time we had never met them, never toured with them before. They were a big influence on Slayer, so to open up for them was really cool.": "Dave",
  "Well, a sort of epiphany: I was in a great band. And it's very cool to be at 53 and realise that when you were a kid you were in a great band.": "Bob",
  "If you want to go to the mall, you have to take security. But it's always cool. The kids are amazing.": "Aaliyah",
  "I read the script for Wonder Boys, and I said that was almost perfect, it was so classy, cool and funny. It's a really specific thing. We stuck to it, it turned out good and a lot of people liked it.": "Robert",
  "Where I come from it was really unheard of to be at a party and someone says, 'What kind of music do you make?', and you say, 'Pop music.' You may as well have 'I'm not cool' stamped on your forehead.": "Lady",
  "I try to explain to people that you get the roles that are right when they're right. If you have a nerd character but you're kind of a cool guy, you're probably not going to get the nerd part. The nerd is going to get the nerd part. You know, someone like me.": "Ed",
  "You have to be the best of whatever you are, but successful, cool actresses come in all shapes and sizes.": "Jessica",
  "Fame and stuff like that is all very cool, but at the end of the day, we're all human beings. Although what I do is incredibly surreal and fun and amazing and I'm really grateful for it, I don't believe my own press release, do you know what I mean?": "Tom",
  "I think working with Johnny Depp was very intimidating. It was my fault though. I mean he's a total cool nice, nice guy, but I was just so, I don't know, overpowered by his presence. Like he's a very mystic person. He's older so I never really warmed up around him. I was so stiff.": "Franka",
  "I'm a big techno fan. I love that thumping kick drum. We heard a version of 'Lost in Love' and it was thrash metal. It sounded cool!": "Graham",
  "I remember being on film sets when I was younger, and only men got to do the cool action movies. So I thought, 'Maybe I'll get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff too,' which is what happened when we did 'Charlie's Angels.' Starting my production company was a big turning point for me.": "Drew",
  "If you meet a girl, you meet a girl. It's normal, so if you exchange numbers, whatevs, it's cool.": "Zayn",
  "Violence is a very ugly thing. Violence is often so casual on film, and made to look so cool and so sexy, but violence is a repulsive, repugnant act that human beings inflict on each other. It shouldn't seem to be cool and sexy, ever really.": "James",
  "'Aladdin' was probably my favorite Disney animation when I was a kid. The animation was great and Robin Williams was unbelievable as the Genie. 'Aladdin' was an amazing adventure and the lead character was a hero for guys, which I loved. It wasn't a princess or a girl beating the odds; it was a street rat. That seemed really cool to me.": "Zachary",
  "As far as friendships go, things change even without the fame. People start moving on. I have a few friends that are married and are starting to have kids and I'm like, 'Oh my goodness gracious - that's so insane.' I also have friends who are just doing their own thing, which is cool.": "Jordin",
  "I think it's interesting to have a cool character not look so cool, you know?": "Norman",
  "My niece was very much caught up in the vampire craze for young adults, and she thought having a vampire boyfriend would be a cool thing. What do you do on a first date? The more I thought about it, the more fun I had imagining what you'd serve a vampire for dinner.": "Deborah",
  "New diseases like SARS and bird flu cause anxiety in the community. People get worried, some to the extent that it even affects their health. You feel very sad, and yet you must carry on and maintain your cool in very trying and difficult moments. You have to tough it out.": "Margaret",
  "I'm thinking, 'Man, there's this whole other group of people that are attached to me because of my last name and my family's roots.' That's pretty cool. That's special, that's a lot of power and it's important.": "Mark",
  "I don't view Twitter as a promotional tool but as a really, really, really cool cocktail party.": "Kurt",
  "Perfect heroes are cool, but no one can really empathize or identify with them.": "Masashi",
  "When The Daily Muse initially wanted to launch a job board, our first ideas were insanely (and needlessly) complex. We wanted to integrate with social networks, gather rich personal data to build predictive algorithms, and put together numerous cool visualization tools before launching out to the world. We were just sure users would love it!": "Kathryn",
  "I don't go out drinking and stuff like that. My friends say 'Just have one drink, JD.' I say 'What's the point?' I'll go to a club and have a Red Bull, get my buzz. And the next day I feel cool. It's discipline, not just with drinking but a lot of things in life. You've just got to look at the bigger picture.": "Jermain",
  "The world needs actual excitement and emotion more than it needs cool people.": "Amanda",
  "I was just a big fan of tattoos always growing up, and I wanted something cool that symbolizes what I've been through in my life, and everything on my chest and my back is like a collage.": "Kevin",
  "I remember my first run-in with cops. It took me really getting to hang, well after that, with cops who were cool, and realizing, 'Okay, there are some bad ones.' I ran into some bad ones in Columbus, Ohio, but they're not all bad.": "Woody",
  "When you make a book or you make a movie, it is almost like hitting on somebody. It's not because you want to seduce people that you will seduce them; you can hit on somebody and it doesn't work. But when you hit on them and it works, then it's really cool.": "Marjane",
  "I don't need to come back to Wimbledon every year because I can't live without it. I'd be totally cool without tennis.": "Roger",
  "The world that I am coming from, hip-hop, is so regurgitated and repetitive that some people are used to that and they don't want change, they don't like change. And I get that, that's cool. Luckily for me, I'm confident in myself as an artist where I can do what I want, and as long as I'm cool with it, I'm cool with it.": "Kid",
  "I first met my husband when I was 15. He was very cool, in a band, all that kind of thing, but he took a long time to grow up. Our paths crossed again 10 years later, and after about two weeks I knew that was it. I'm glad I met him when I did, even though I was fairly young. Because I think sometimes you can crystallise into singledom.": "Natascha",
  "I met Bill Clinton; he's a very nice guy. Yeah, Bill Clinton's cool.": "Ed",
  "My dad probably gave me the best advice growing up. I think it's really just keeping your cool in situations and learning to balance everything.": "Cassie",
  "Being incarcerated is truly very serious, and it has changed my life to such an extent that breaking the cycle has become my sole focus. Jail is definitely not cool. Education is.": "Ja",
  "'Cyberspace' as a term is sort of over. It's over in the way that, after a certain time, people stopped using the suffix '-electro' to make things cool, because everything was electrical. 'Electro' was all over the early 20th century, and now it's gone. I think 'cyber' is sort of the same way.": "William",
  "My advice to young people wanting to make music and to be in this industry is to really spend your time making music. Make so much music you have no friends. Make music. Figure out what it is you love, and... because if you're making cool art, then everything else will fall into line.": "Lorde",
  "Growing up in a cold place, in Southern Ontario, Woolrich was a brand of choice for us because it was always warm and comfortable. The parka with the fur on it was standard fare for us. It's extraordinary that they have kept up with the times. Beyond the parka, they have changed, and they have some pretty hip, cool items which I wear.": "Douglas",
  "Entrepreneurship is seen as if you're in Silicon Valley or New York City and starting an app business or a social-media business, which is cool. But what we really have to focus on is people who make things, and how can we fund them, and how can we encourage people to stay in their community and make a difference in their community.": "Hamdi",
  "We believe it is bad or dangerous to be carried away by our emotions. We admire the person who is cool, who acts without feeling.": "Alexander",
  "I don't like to say 'dork' and 'nerd' and things like that because I think that everyone is cool in their own right.": "Jaime",
  "Thom Browne, Michael Bastian... all these people that I love, when I finally get to meet them, I'm like, 'You're a cool guy!'": "Brad",
  "I have this obsession with really cool, old books.": "Constance",
  "Asking Siri where the nearest sushi bar is - that's not interesting. What's interesting is asking your phone where one of your friends have last had dinner in the neighborhood, or having it recommend a cool paella place in Barcelona because it knows you eat paella all the time at home.": "Dennis",
  "In 2007, I hit 50 home runs. That was pretty cool. I never thought I'd be able to do that. At the time, I didn't even think it was that big of a deal for some reason. But now, looking back, I realize it was pretty cool.": "Prince",
  "Living in New Zealand, it's like a different world - it is a different world. It's very, very cool.": "Luke",
  "Growing up, I didn't get the talk of 'Make sure boys take you on a date and treat you right.' So I was the girl who wasn't dating and would just text. I dated these guys who didn't have jobs, and I would always be paying. At one point, I remember looking in the mirror and thinking, 'You're too pretty and cool to be treated like this.'": "Meghan",
  "I am the 'Cosmic Dancer' who dances his way out of the womb and into the tomb on 'Electric Warrior.' I'm not frightened to get up there and groove about in front of six million people on TV because it doesn't look cool. That's the way I would do it at home.": "Marc",
  "I have got prostate cancer, and I have to keep monitoring that. It's no problem, it's under control and I'm very cool about it, but other people are dying from it.": "Ian",
  "The only other thing I can really remember wanting to do besides acting was a gas station attendant. At the time, that seemed like a great job - wash the windows, pump the gas - it looks so cool coming home with black hands. There's a natural transition, from wanting to be a gas station attendant to being an actor, right?": "Daniel",
  "The reason it has taken so long for the robotics industry to move forward is because people keep trying to make something that is cool but difficult to achieve rather than trying to find solutions to actual human problems. Technology can be extremely expensive if you don't focus.": "Colin",
  "To me, Sid Vicious is cool. Super chill.": "Tyler,",
  "I'm cool with my body, I love my body. I wouldn't trade it for no other body.": "Marshawn",
  "Being on a lunchbox was awesome, and being on a thermos was pretty cool, too.": "Zach",
  "Rey is so strong. She's cool and smart and she can look after herself. Young girls can look at her and know that they can wear trousers if they want to. That they don't have to show off their bodies.": "Daisy",
  "I've done so much travelling in the past few years, and when you travel, you realise that we do actually have a cool, clean look in Scandinavia - it's not just Denmark - which I think brings peace if you have it in your home.": "Birgitte",
  "Getting to share the stories in my head with other people and have them enjoy those stories, and having them come to see my characters as real. That's so cool.": "Gail",
  "The really cool thing about festivals is that you're getting to play in front of a whole lot of people who have never heard of us before. That's exciting. At the same time, it's a little bit of a challenge to capture the attention of people who have already seen a lot of bands.": "Josh",
  "Technology is cool, but you've got to use it as opposed to letting it use you.": "Prince",
  "I write poems, I meditate. I don't live up to people's expectations. I don't do the conventional cool things - I know I am the coolest person.": "Kangana",
  "Isn't it crazy to think that we've explored space more than we have explored the depths of our ocean? That just fires up my imagination about potential sea monsters and cool creatures, that kind of stuff.": "James",
  "When you're playing music through the streets of London at 2 o'clock in the morning, there's something so cool and magical about that. It takes you to a special place very quickly.": "Rachel",
  "There's no idea or concept in comedy you could do that hasn't been attacked from some angle. But if you start leaving punchlines out so you'll look cool, I don't get that. But I don't watch standup anyway, so I don't know what they're doing.": "Ron",
  "I think, for the first time, people are starting to say, 'That's Sterling K. Brown,' which is cool, which is uncharted territory for your boy. It's nice to be called by your name when you're not in character.": "Sterling",
  "Anything I get to wear to the Met Ball is huge. I'm not a fashion girl, so it's cool to be dolled up and have those diamonds where they send armed guards with you.": "Chrissy",
  "My best friend was really cool, and she went to a youth theatre in Paisley, so I thought maybe that's the way to do it. I went along, and I immediately found something I was passionate about and really enjoyed.": "Richard",
  "I have to stay calm, cool, and collected.": "Canelo",
  "The films that have influenced me most are: 'The Hustler', 'Badlands', 'Hud', 'Tender Mercies', 'Cool Hand Luke', 'A Perfect World', and 'Laurence of Arabia'. I also really like 'Fletch'. I feel like all of these films reached an honest place in regard to the human condition while also stringing together really entertaining stories.": "Jeff",
  "It wasn't like I wanted to be the next Marc Andreessen, but it would be cool to be in the same place.": "Jawed",
  "People expect you to be doing something cool all the time. In a normal life, that's not happening!": "Kaia",
  "My aspiration isn't to be famous; it's to design clothes. If that gets me attention at the end of the day, cool.": "Sofia",
  "My brother's my best friend, without a doubt. Me and my big sister get along so well. She moved to East London, though, so points off, but she's wicked. And then my little sister is a little genius. She's super talented and such a great person, always been far more mature and cool than me.": "Will",
  "When the NBA adopted their uniform that they had to wear, I thought that was very interesting. And you see the way NBA players dress: It's very cool.": "Tom",
  "At the end of the day, we all know what the Jordan logo means, and you can't take anything away from that. But it's pretty cool to have my own logo on a Jordan shoe.": "Kawhi",
  "I am young, and I am cool, and I want to wear cool clothes!": "Aidy",
  "One of the reasons I'm excited by what visionary Elon Musk has done with the Tesla is to show that you can reduce global warming and drive a powerful, fun car. A cool car helps make a cooler planet.": "Dean",
  "It's just cool to witness talent.": "Kenan",
  "When you're growing up, I think there's this idea that the coolest people are the ones who are really rude and feverish. But I've come to realize that isn't cool.": "Charli",
  "I'm just trying to work out a way to be a singer and to create cool content. I'm willing to do that as an entertainer. But I'm not willing to give up my actual self.": "Sia",
  "I wasn't the cool kid in school, but I wasn't the lame one. I knew I wasn't cool, so I called myself lame, and that's what made me cool in front of the cool kids.": "Astro",
  "I laugh at what I used to think was cool when I was growing up. In all seriousness, I thought having braces was cool.": "Rachel",
  "I think the whole thing, boy band, it's a little bit of a dirty word. They say it's not a good thing to be in a boy band. We want to change that. We want to make the boy band cool. It's not just about dancing and dressing the same.": "Liam",
  "And of course I've got kids of my own now, and they love me being in the Harry Potter films. I'm now part of a phenomenon. You become incredibly cool to your kids, and you get a young fan base. So you became the cool dad at school. You're suddenly hip.": "Gary",
  "I used to be a cool chick but I'm not anymore.": "Britney",
  "As a kid, I did want to be an old-timer, since they were the ones with the big stories and the cool clothes. I wanted to go there. Now, I guess I want to bring that with me and go back in time.": "Tom",
  "Long intros are cool because there's a little bit of anticipation, you know?": "Miranda",
  "It's cool to be recognised by your peers.": "Frank",
  "It's pretty cool to see how far music can take you.": "Luke",
  "I was the kid growing up who would play with G.I. Joes in a pink dress and then run off to play with my Barbies. It doesn't mean that I'm less girly, it just means that I have this other side of me. It's kinda cool to be a little bit of both, I think.": "Adrianne",
  "Music's been with me from the get-go. It was always around me as a kid. Dad got me my first guitar when I was 11 and, at school, if you wanted to be cool you had to be in a band.": "Julian",
  "I think part of picking where you live in New York is accepting who you are. Really looking at yourself and going, 'Yeah, I'm not cool enough for the West Village.'": "Tina",
  "It's very important to enjoy time alone with yourself and just existing, because existence is kind of cool.": "Angel",
  "What's cool about Spider-Man is that it's everybody - anyone, you put on the suit, anyone believes that you're Spider-Man. That's what's charming about the character. He's anyone. He's a huge nerd that ends up being this huge superhero.": "Jake",
  "Being cool is when you win, you don't get too happy; and when you lose, you don't get too mad.": "Ice",
  "I was feeling like a real misfit in middle school, but when I saw 'Wicked,' it made me feel really cool for being different... and you can carve that in stone!": "Jennifer",
  "Photographing friends means that there's a spontaneity to the images. I have a lot of love for my friends and family, and I love taking cool pictures of them.": "Suki",
  "The concept of the robot encapsulates both aspects of technology. On one hand it's cool, it's fun, it's healthy, it's sexy, it's stylish. On the other hand it's terrifying, it's alienating, it's addictive, and it's scary. That has been the subject of much science-fiction literature.": "Thomas",
  "It's pretty cool I'm known for FIFA. If you think of KSI, people instantly think, 'Ah, that FIFA YouTuber.' I didn't think I would be up there as the ambassador of FIFA on YouTube, but I'll take it.": "KSI",
  "I never panic when I get a wasp at my ear. As soon as you strike out, they'll sting you. So just stay cool.": "Martin",
  "At a young age, it is hard to be different from the crowd. I want to encourage young girls that it is cool to be different. Young women should be pleased they have something unique and make the most of their talent.": "Bryony",
  "There are some parts of my life that are wonderful, and it's amazing to get to go to cool events and award shows and things like that, but I think the outside perception is that your life just changes overnight and you wear Dolce and Gabanna suits and drive a Mercedes. But life's just not like that.": "Taron",
  "Pluto is still active four and a half billion years into its history. It was expected that small planets like Pluto would cool off long ago and not still be showing geological activity. Pluto is, in fact, showing numerous examples of geological activity on a massive scale across the planet.": "Alan",
  "I do value the respect I get from my contemporaries, but to have Oasis cover my song, to have Puff Daddy cover a song, to have Goldie come along to my gigs - that's where my ego is at. To have my fellow musicians like what I do, that's very cool.": "David",
  "I loved the world of roller derby because I thought it was such an empowering metaphor, that you get out there and do it. It's such a rocker, athletic, capable, cool exhibitionist sport; it's about this great sort of camaraderie.": "Drew",
  "There's something about girls together, uniting, that I just thought was cool.": "Charli",
  "I've always loved Jennifer Lopez, and I think, as an entertainer, she is a great example of a strong woman that is also very levelheaded and cool and produces her own content.": "Christina",
  "When I was a child, it was cool to be a scientist.": "Michio",
  "I look at other people my age in this industry, other famous people my age, and they've just got famous friends. Which is cool, but I love being normal and just chilling at mine.": "Maisie",

  "What is cool today is not going to be cool tomorrow, and what wasn't cool yesterday is going to be cool tomorrow.": "Zendaya",
  "I enjoy fashion photography and textiles, that whole aspect of it. As more of an art form, I like Proenza Schouler. Those guys are really cool because they seem to have an interesting approach to it all.": "Gia",
  "I always say, 'If it looks good on a T-shirt, it would probably be a pretty cool title or cool song.'": "Cole",
  "The challenge is to stay cool enough to handle the pressure in the moment so that you can succeed in the future.": "Jurgen",
  "The softest thing I've ever heard are the wind chimes in my backyard. They are soft and cool and mellow.": "Ty",
  "I used to love to draw. I didn't want to go to art class because I felt that would be too corny when I was young, but architectural drafting was the cool thing to do because there was more precision. It taught me a lot about building and structures and doorways and frames and windowsills.": "Ice",
  "I don't mind The Boss. I think he's an honest guy. I have some of his records, not all of them. I've met a couple of the E-Street guys, and they seem really cool.": "Henry",
  "In Israel, there's a lot to learn from anyone, because to live there you've got to deal with the truth. Things happen real fast. Your day goes from cool to catastrophic in one second. Israelis know that the cafe you're in could blow up, or the shopping mall, and they rock that.": "Henry",
  "America was cool with Saddam Hussein when he was killing Iranians.": "Henry",
  "I wonder what it's like to be from a state that is spread across a few islands way out in the Pacific Ocean, only added to the United States in 1959. Not only that but to be the birthplace of America's first black president? Pretty cool, I bet.": "Henry",
  "Most Americans are very cool people.": "Henry",
  "I get along with Australians really well. Everyone's usually really cool, and it's always a drag to leave.": "Henry",
  "I hate painting with a broad brush, but I think the birther thing, at its root, is racist. The guy was born in Hawaii. A black guy is president. It's cool. Get over it. Just deal with it. There's nothing you could show these birther people that would shut them up.": "Henry",
  "Imagine a 15-year-old kid saying, 'I have two moms - it's cool.' I don't fear that at all.": "Henry",
  "I am not immune to the lure of a signed record, flier or set list. The fact that your music heroes potentially had, in their own hands, the record you now have in yours is kind of cool. When the musician has departed, it can give the thing a unique power.": "Henry",
  "Horses and horsepower alike are about status and being cool.": "P.",
  "I don't ever feel like the cool kid at the party, ever. It's like, 'Smile and be nice to everybody, because you were not invited to be here.'": "Taylor",
  "I think who you are in school really sticks with you. I don't ever feel like the cool kid at the party, ever. It's like, 'Smile and be nice to everybody, because you were not invited to be here.'": "Taylor",
  "It never mattered to me that people in school didn't think that country music was cool, and they made fun of me for it - though it did matter to me that I was not wearing the clothes that everybody was wearing at that moment. But at some point, I was just like, 'I like wearing sundresses and cowboy boots.'": "Taylor",
  "When I'm 40 and nobody wants to see me in a sparkly dress anymore, I'll be like: 'Cool, I'll just go in the studio and write songs for kids.'": "Taylor",
  "If someone has a really great boyfriend or career, I think, it's cool that happens.": "Taylor",
  "One of the biggest challenges we have, folks, is making liberty and freedom cool.": "Rush",
  "The advent of cellphones may, in the end, be no more relevant than the ability of laptops to change our written documents into ones using cool new fonts.": "Douglas",
  "I would like to fly in space. Absolutely. That would be cool. I used to just do personally risky things, but now I've got kids and responsibilities, so I can't be my own test pilot. That wouldn't be a good idea. But I definitely want to fly as soon as it's a sensible thing to do.": "Elon",
  "So there's nothing more provocative than taking a genre that everybody who's cool hates - and then making it cool.": "Lady",
  "The thing is, it's not uncool to worry about people who seem like they're going on the wrong path. There's nothing cool about being self-destructive.": "Patti",
  "It's not uncool to worry about people who seem like they're going on the wrong path. There's nothing cool about being self-destructive.": "Patti",
  "That's one of the cool things about fame. You have an affect on society and where it goes.": "Jeff",
  "I have a cycle that is not particularly cool, but it's a cycle: trash myself to reward myself.": "Jeff",
  "My mother and my father were very nurturing and wonderful examples of how to live your life. I really had a cool foundation.": "Jeff",
  "I grew up not really having anything, so the idea that I can take care of my family and my friends now is a really cool bonus.": "Katy",
  "I don't like the ironic tone that our pop culture, in the world, has taken. Everything is 'ironic.' Everything is 'cool.'": "Alejandro",
  "You make yourself broad. You make yourself appealing. 'Hey, y'all, I'm cool with everybody.' That's my message.": "Kevin",
  "I'm not cool enough to hang out with any rock stars. Jay-Z doesn't come over to my house. I don't hang out with Ted Nugent.": "Ted",
  "London Fashion Week isn't the most organised, but I don't mind that. It's such an exciting place - it's small and cool.": "Carine",
  "When I was a kid, maybe 11, I remember saying, 'When I grow up I wanna have enough money to buy a really cool car, because I won't.'": "Joss",
  "I am not a fan of referencing your own work when it's in a different universe than what you're doing. That, to me, is a wink at the audience, and winking isn't actually cool when you're not, like, 10.": "Joss",
  "It's only recently women got to be action heroes on TV. Progress is slow, and often non-existent. There's plenty of cool comics with female characters... But all it takes is one Catwoman to set the cause back a decade.": "Joss",
  "I was probably cool around the end of 2002.": "Martin",
  "I don't like 'cool telly.'": "Martin",
  "I'm not quite as cool as I would like to be, really.": "Ian",
  "My friends are people who like building cool stuff. We always have this joke about people who want to just start companies without making something valuable. There's a lot of that in Silicon Valley.": "Mark",
  "A lot of people are focused on taking over the world or doing the biggest thing and getting the most users. I think part of making a difference and doing something cool is focusing intensely.": "Mark",
  "My goal was never to make Facebook cool. I am not a cool person.": "Mark",
  "'Fast and Furious' is the only franchise that I've directed that I did not create from scratch. So it definitely was an eye-opening experience for me coming to that world. I had to be respectful of the roles that had been established by the filmmakers before me, and I was cool with that.": "James",
  "My low-budget films, more than anything, taught me that you've got to create cool, likable characters and great stories because, if you don't, it doesn't matter how cool it might look - no one is going to care about it.": "James",
  "I always say, what is cool for me with 'The Conjuring', is it's not just another scary set piece or another scary case; it's more about what I can do with the characters of Ed and Lorraine Warren.": "James",
  "There's something very cool about that indie spirit that I try to hang on to even now with the bigger films that I'm working on.": "James",
  "I grew up loving X-Men, Spider-Man and Batman. Those are obviously the key big ones, but there's always something kind of cool about Aquaman still, the idea of creating a huge world that is on our planet.": "James",
  "I won't do things for money. I can't. So I'll hold out and say, in my mind, 'There's a really cool diner down the street from my house. They make really good pancakes; I'd be happy doing that.'": "Brie",
  "The cool thing about designers is they have very specific points of view, and because my inspiration is always changing, it's easy to go, 'This feels right.' But just because I wear fancy dresses on weekends doesn't mean in my heart of hearts I'm not a jeans and T-shirt person.": "Brie",
  "I have snakes, three sharks, moray eels, piranhas, five scorpions and a bird spider. All of them are predators. They are dangerous but it's cool to have strong and powerful pets.": "Tracy",
  "Cool is the enemy of funny. You can't be cool and be funny at the same time. Only Eddie Murphy could do that.": "Tracy",
  "The truth is - I found myself doing these huge action-adventure movies, and um, and which are cool man. And I really love doing them. And thankfully I haven't had too much dialogue, because if I had I would have really made a mess of it. You know what I mean?": "Orlando",
  "Elves are cool, man.": "Orlando",
  "I wondered how they would top the Pirates and skeletons and moonlight, because that's a pretty cool concept.": "Orlando",
  "I'm trying to mix the cool, independent stuff with the big stuff, but it's been difficult finding the right roles. It's been an interesting ride as far as my career pendulum is concerned.": "Orlando",
  "Steve McQueen is my style hero. He's just cool, isn't he?": "Orlando",
  "When I realized that if I was an actor, I could be any character I wanted instead of just one particular, I was like, 'Wow, that's cool.'": "Orlando",
  "I used to ride motorbikes and drive cars like everything was a racetrack it was ridiculous. It wasn't because I thought it was cool it was just because I loved living on the edge. But I've chilled. ": "Orlando",
  "The nerds are the ones that make the films and do loads of other really cool stuff in their life.": "Daniel",
  "I've never been one of the cool people at school, but then again, I don't get the people who are cool. It's not that I don't like them, it's just that they don't interest me.": "Daniel",
  "I met Elijah Wood once, I met Peter Jackson, I met Orlando Bloom, and they're all really cool.": "Daniel",
  "A part of me wants to sort of try and sound cool and feed this myth that I'm some sort of glamorous lothario, but I was raised by women - my mother and her mother and my aunts - and as a result, most of my friends have always been women.": "Moby",
  "I recently discovered Artkive, a wonderful app that allows you to archive your child's artwork and create cool gifts like photo albums, mugs, mousepads, etc. It's very easy to use, and since Arabella is such a talented artist, I'm a pro!": "Ivanka",
  "If you could drive straight down, into a tunnel bored through the crust of the planet, you'd hit this molten mess in about an hour. It's called the asthenosphere - a sluggish sea, several hundred miles thick, on which floats the Earth's cool epidermis - the so-called tectonic plates.": "Seth",
  "Plate tectonics is not all havoc and destruction. The slow movement of continents and ocean floors recycles carbon dioxide dissolved in the oceans back into the atmosphere. Without this slow speed carbon cycle, Earth's temperatures would cool dozens of degrees below your comfort zone.": "Seth",
  "Gwen Stefani's style and flow I just love. She is so cool to me!": "Rita",
  "I'd love to be the female Kanye. I think he's so cool and effortless.": "Rita",
  "They're very, uh, you know, I don't come from the suburbs and a jolly, Disney type of lifestyle. I come from something totally different. And they're cool and bare minimum so it's not always a money issue for me.": "Shia",
  "What's cool is when you're able to give your audience imagination and you don't have to cage them in like animals.": "Shia",
  "I'm a video game fan, and I always thought it would be cool to be able to control a character.": "Shia",
  "If people could walk around in suits of energy, that would be cool. Other than that, I don't think men should wear spandex.": "Blake",
  "Ngila Dixon is such an incredible costume designer. She's such a cool, stylish woman. She has such an understanding of character.": "Blake",
  "So, it's cool that, yes, Hal Jordan is a superhero, but my character is a real-world hero in her own life.": "Blake",
  "I still, at hotel rooms, I do this one sort of not-so-cool thing: continually shoving my room service tray in front of someone else's door. Because I don't want the remnants. I don't want to be caught, like, being like the pig that I was at two in the morning.": "Drew",
  "I remember being on film sets when I was younger, and only men got to do the cool action movies. So I thought, 'Maybe I'll get to produce one day and get to do cool stuff, too,' which is what happened when we did 'Charlie's Angels'.": "Drew",
  "My mother used to dress rather risque when I was a kid, and that sort of shocked me. I always thought moms were supposed to wear cardigans and flats, but she was in leather bracelets and minidresses. In hindsight, it was pretty cool, but I'm probably more conservative because of it.": "Drew",
  "It took being famous to make me cool, which, by the way, I never forgot.": "Rob",
  "People want to go out and travel around and meet cool people. I could just go live in Vermont, but is that what I really want?": "Tom",
  "I love the idea of real-life experiences finding their way into fiction. I think that's really cool.": "Joel",
  "Someone like Vincent Price or somebody like Christopher Lee, they never won an award, and it doesn't matter. They're cool.": "Nicolas",
  "Mike Myers as Austin Powers makes me laugh - that was genius - and Daffy Duck makes me laugh, but I like odd behavior. I don't like hip dialogue and one-liners and all that sort of cool, sophomoric comedy. It's just not for me.": "Nicolas",
  "In the hot summer months, popsicles are a perfect way to cool down while enjoying a delicious, fruity treat. Frozen, refreshing, mouth-friendly candy on a stick cannot get any better... or can it?": "Marcus",
  "It's cool cause my sister is older than me and we went to the same high school, so by the time I got to high school, I got the lowdown on all the teachers and everything.": "Zooey",
  "I went to Northwestern because I had gone to a really nontraditional high school. I was like, 'It'd be cool to have a traditional college experience.' Then I was like, 'Oh, but none of these people understand what's cool about me. My specialness is not appreciated in this place.'": "Zooey",
  "Growing up in Hollywood meant there were a lot of film stars' kids at my school - but no conspicuous wealth. It wasn't cool to show off that you had money.": "Zooey",
  "But being on location and shooting, whether its in Puerto Rico or Atlanta, it always reminds me of how really cool my job can be. Interacting with the fans is one of the best parts of it.": "Dwayne",
  "'Be Cool' was a defining movie for me.": "Dwayne",
  "If you're going to walk out of the house in jeans and T-shirt, what can you do to make that interesting? Is it putting on a bright-colored pair of high-tops or a cool leather jacket?": "Brad",
  "The forties are very cool and very pastoral. The fifties look like they're pastoral, and then you get a bit more turbulence.": "Pierce",
  "Susanne Bier's work I've always really enjoyed. She's just such a great filmmaker; she's very cool and very sexy - that always helps, too.": "Pierce",
  "I love 'Maxim,' actually. It's very cool.": "Pierce",
  "Crunches are much more effective than regular sit-ups because they specifically target your upper abdominal muscles rather than your hip muscles. If you're not used to them, they can cause soreness a day or two later, but it's a 'cool' soreness. A badge of honor.": "Sylvester",
  "I've always believed in good music over bad music. I believe in two sorts of musics. And the lines that separate us, I don't believe in that. That's for people who need to easily define what they're hearing. Me, I'm cool with everything and anything I'm hearing that's music. It comes under one definition for me.": "Jay-Z",
  "You make your first album, you make some money, and you feel like you still have to show face, like 'I still go to the projects.' I'm like, why? Your job is to inspire people from your neighborhood to get out. You grew up there. What makes you think it's so cool?": "Jay-Z",
  "Growing up, politics never trickled down to the areas we come from. But people from Obama's camp, and Obama himself, reached out to me and asked for my help on the campaign. We've sat and had dinner, and we've spoken on the phone. He's a very sharp guy. Very charming. Very cool.": "Jay-Z",
  "No one dislikes LL Cool J. If you meet LL Cool J, you fall in love with LL Cool J. LL and I had mutual friends, and he and I had always talked about doing something. My fans know LL's music. And I love him - we're blood brothers at this point. We've been through the fire together. I know no finer person.": "Brad",
  "The artists who stick around for a while are the ones who go, 'Oh, that's cool, never thought of that. Ought to do that.'": "Brad",
  "Obama can't change his cool disposition, though it would be nice if he lost the vaguely grudging air he gives off that problems of management get in the way of ideas.": "Tina",
  "The reason why I am proud of my part in the punk movement is that I think it really did implant a message that was already there. The hippies told it to me, but punk made it something cool for people to stand up for, which is that we do not believe government, that we are against government.": "Vivienne",
  "I think big brows are pretty cool.": "Charli",
  "I think it's cool to be a rock star I don't think there are many. There aren't many who speak out and take risks. And I think that's important. ": "Charli",
  "I think the best people are the ones who are just as nice and fun. This is really cheesy, but you only have one life - why spend most of it pretending to be cool?": "Charli",
  "I'm lucky I have really cool parents.": "Charli",
  "I was never the cool kid in school, and loads of people told me that I was weird, that I dressed uncool and did uncool things, that I was too nice, too happy.": "Charli",
  "I've always wanted to write pop music. I never wanted to be cool or make a hipster record.": "Charli",
  "I never set out to be a cult cool artist. I always made music that I thought was pop.": "Charli",
  "I used to worry about being cool. Now I realize that I genuinely don't care.": "Charli",
  "Sometimes I feel like I was born in the wrong year - I think it would have been cool to be alive in the '60s.": "Charli",
  "I've passed up on many a thing that could have made me a big artist or something. Like, I was offered a feature on a Christina Aguilera song and I turned it down. It just wasn't right. She's cool, but it just wasn't right.": "Charli",
  "Being cool, having a 'cool' energy is just not attractive to me.": "Selena",
  "My mom was really cool.": "Ryan",
  "There are people out there who are older who are cool. I want that.": "Billy",
  "At my age, I'm not trying to score cool points. I'm just excited when I can speak to younger members of our audience in the WWE. I just get to be a superhero to kids, but I'm not trying to be on the cutting edge of style or anything like that. Once you reach that point of deprivation, you don't mind it.": "John",
  "Blood is one of the things that made fights cool. Like, you knew it had gotten serious. I understand why we don't do it anymore.": "John",
  "I really, really, really love my job, so it's not like I'm trying to quit wrestling to do movies. They just all seemed like cool things to do. I mean, I'd love to be the bad guy in an action movie because then people would get to see another side of me they don't get to see.": "John",
  "That's how I grew up - it wasn't cool to not have a good system.": "Jimmy",
  "I always wanted to be where the cool was because I didn't think I was cool. But music was cool.": "Jimmy",
  "I can't learn in school, but I can learn from somebody who I think is cool and great.": "Jimmy",
  "I knew in my heart that I wasn't cool, but I figured I could at least be cool by association.": "Jimmy",
  "I follow cool. When I went up to see Steve Jobs, I said, 'The party's at this guy's house.'": "Jimmy",
  "Seeing young people caring about sound again and realizing that it's not cool to not have good sound, that means a lot.": "Jimmy",
  "I have a satellite radio show called 'The Legends of Reggae.' It's a cool way to branch out and do other things. I'm paying respect to the legends of reggae.": "Ziggy",
  "My father and I had a really good relationship. We're cool. I am not trying to outdo him or anything like that.": "Ziggy",
  "I suppose the only thing at 50 you can really start to look forward to is just total irresponsibility. As you get older, you can just sit in a chair, wear anything you want, you know you can walk down; old people dress cool. You know they wear sweatpants. The elderly have it down.": "Johnny",
  "iTunes kind of feels like Sam Goody to me. I don't feel cool when I go there. I'm tired of seeing John Mayer's face pop up.": "Trent",
  "'Yeezus,' I really love it. I think the sound of it is cool.": "Trent",
  "When your culture comes from watching TV every day, you're bombarded with images of things that seem cool, places that seem interesting, people who have jobs and careers and opportunities. None of that happened where I was. You're almost taught to realize it's not for you.": "Trent",
  "A good president needs a big comfort zone. He should be able to treat enemies as opportunities, appear authentic in joy and grief, stay cool under the hot lights.": "Nancy",
  "I loved animation and cartoons, even when it was not cool when you were in high school. I raced home to see the Bugs Bunny cartoons.": "John",
  "I love Japan. I love the collision of the modern and ancient worlds coming together in that place. It's so high-tech and cool.": "John",
  "Fortunately for me, I'm married to an amazing woman - Nancy Lasseter - who is wise enough not to let me buy every car I want. If I was single, I would be living in a very small apartment and renting a warehouse full of cool cars.": "John",
  "Nowadays, the truth is, I think a lot of the newer generation of action stars usually are pretty self-deprecating and cool. I mean, Dwayne Johnson is a great example.": "Adam",
  "McCain is the kid who was really cool in middle school but never got high school game and people are sick of him acting like he's still popular.": "Adam",
  "When I think of the definition of cool and when I look at people, John Travolta is really the definition of cool because, not only is he great in all his movies, but, as a person, he's just really cool.": "Christina",
  "My real last name is Flores, and Milian is actually my mom's maiden name. So it's not made up, which is cool; it runs in the family. And it actually worked out better for my career to have the last name Milian, because Flores kept me in a little box, and no one really associated me with the last name Flores.": "Christina",
  "I had a really great performance with Steven Tyler in the movie 'Be Cool.' I performed 'Cryin',' so we recorded the song beforehand. But I didn't get to meet him until I hit the stage with him, and we had a live performance with 30,000 people in the audience, and that was for the movie.": "Christina",
  "In the end, the whole Internet thing kills me, because you can use it as a positive thing or you can read into all the negativity. And I think you've gotta put out positive energy, put out cool viral stuff, and then just stay out of people's opinions.": "Nikki",
  "I just think if I can go from being a homeless kid with a dream of being in the biggest band in the world and making that happen, I can do a lot of other cool stuff, too.": "Nikki",
  "If your album sells, that's cool, more people find out about you, more people get turned on to what we're really about-which is a live rock and roll band.": "Nikki",
  "Reflecting back, we all make mistakes; we all go through our stuff - relationships, financial, all kinds of stuff - and if you can grow from that and pass that message on, it's a pretty cool thing.": "Nikki",
  "It's really cool to know that there are so many people out there that are attached to me or projects that I've done to really feel that it's a personal relationship.": "Nikki",
  "Nothing that Robert Plant does will ever equal Led Zeppelin, but that doesn't mean he's going to stop being creative. Jimmy Page has so many incredibly cool projects, but it's not Led Zeppelin; there will only ever be one Led Zeppelin.": "Nikki",
  "After a while, you just want transportation, and things like cool cars or motorcycles are all about getting attention. I get all the attention I could ever need, so I kind of like being in a minivan and people not paying so much attention to me.": "George",
  "I just like short hair on women I think it's cool. ": "Evangeline",
  "What a cool job to be part of - whether it's doing lighting or acting or serving food on set. You're part of telling a story that hopefully has an essential component, and that's super exciting to me.": "Laura",
  "I didn't want to be a genius! That ain't cool.": "Missy",
  "Every day I am being told to sign up for Tumblr, Yammer, Friendfeed, Plaxo, Last.fm, ping.fm or the hot social-media tool du jour that happened to get mentioned on Mashable.com. It is like a social-media arms race. Each one of these new tools is like a cool new night club. Hot today, gone tomorrow, replaced with something else.": "Mark",
  "An Oklahoma girl like me wouldn't even know how to be a diva. I'm just a person who has a cool job. I love to be at home. I rarely go to clubs... and I always wear underwear! I just know I'd fall down, and that's not for everyone to see.": "Carrie",
  "I like John McCain, or he seems like a cool guy in a lot of ways. I don't agree with a lot of his policies, but he still seems like a cool guy.": "John",
  "My parents were vegetarians. I'd show up at school, this giant black kid, with none of the cool clothes and a tofu sandwich and celery sticks.": "Aisha",
  "My novel, which I had started with such hope shortly after publishing my first book of stories, wouldn't budge past the 75-page mark. Nothing I wrote past page 75 made any kind of sense. Nothing. Which would have been fine if the first 75 pages hadn't been pretty damn cool.": "Junot",
  "If you, like, consciously think about being cool, you're not cool. If you consciously think about being, like, different or original, you ain't different or original.": "Junot",
  "It's amazing: it's so cool being from Brampton, Ontario, and being able to travel the world and being embraced by so many countries.": "Alessia",
  "It's so cool though when I see thirty-year-old men that are coming in to watch my shows. It's like, 'You really like my music? Like a teenage girl, you relate to it?' It just proves how much people are alike.": "Alessia",
  "'Wild Things' is saying, 'I don't have to belong anywhere. This is where I belong.' It's a place in the back of my mind that I created, and it's cool, and I love it here.": "Alessia",
  "It doesn't occur to me that I don't drive a cool car until I hang out with Jon Hamm, who picks me up in what looks like a Transformer, and I think, 'Oh, that's what movie stars are driving. I guess I'm not a movie star.'": "Bill",
  "England is like the margin of a spring-run: near its source, always green, always cool, always moist, comparatively free from frost in winter and from drought in summer.": "John",
  "Doing graphic novels is cool! It's fun! You get to write something, and then see it visually page by page, panel by panel, working with the artist, you get to see it fleshed out.": "Anthony",
  "I listen to a lot of really old western and country music. There's a lot of cool stuff in there... all the heartbreak of the country darkness.": "Theophilus",
  "I always imagined how cool it would be to be the face of a Gap campaign!": "Theophilus",
  "Sometimes you have the trends that's not that cool. You may have certain artists portraying these trends and don't really have that lifestyle, and then it gives off the wrong thing. And it becomes kinda corny after awhile. It's really about keeping hip-hop original and pushing away the corniness in it.": "Kendrick",
  "Once I started singing, I didn't have to try to be cool. I was just one of the coolest guys around.": "R.",
  "I came from a crew, and to me, all the guys I rapped with were better than me, so I was surprised when I was the breakout one. It was definitely a cool thing.": "Queen",
  "My mom was my main influence growing up, and Phylicia Rashad reminded me a lot of my mother, just the way she handled certain things, she was... not soft-spoken but smooth-spoken. Just very calm, cool, collected about things.": "Queen",
  "I'm cool with myself. If I can't have the body of Angie Bassett, so be it.": "Queen",
  "When I'm wearing too-high heels and swaying my hips, I do that Sharon Stone kind of thing - she has the sexiest walk, a New York cool thing that throws you back.": "Queen",
  "A guy's biggest style mistake is definitely trying to look too cool. As long as you've got a good pair of jeans, a good pair of boots and a few good shirts, you're fine.": "Luke",
  "At that moment in time when we feel like the other, we were not the person embraced, not one of the cool kids, not in the club - when you're that person, it makes you feel smaller, and when they persecute you as a result, that's a difficult position to be in.": "Mahershala",
  "Now, being one who lived in the era of Obama, there are so many markers of improvement made. It's hard to be mindful of that, in the same way you're going, 'Oh everything's cool now!' and it isn't. But I try to be mindful of how much of an improvement there has been because that gives hope. You need hope. I need hope!": "Mahershala",
  "The real guys that I knew were really cool people, who I played basketball with and traveled with on teams and knew their families and knew that they love their family. They just happen to do something that wasn't all the way legal, but it was a part of their life, and you knew that they hustled.": "Mahershala",
  "The first song I learned on the guitar was a Kenny Chesney song called 'What I Need to Do' it was just an easy song to play... and it was really cool to see that come full-circle a few years later and have him record a song that I was part of. ": "Sam",
  "All actors are my brothers and my sisters. It ain't cool to compare or disparage them. It ain't polite.": "Michael",
  "It's cool now to play golf.": "Tiger",
  "The high-spirited man may indeed die, but he will not stoop to meanness. Fire, though it may be quenched, will not become cool.": "Ovid",
  "I love to add '90s trends mixed with modern day pieces I find along my many travels. Like these cool fun hats from Europe I have. I love to collect different ones from every country. I have them from London to Brussels.": "Kat",
  "'Blade' was amazing; I can't imagine the character without Wesley Snipes. He just made a long, black leather trench coat look so cool.": "Kat",
  "I'm really into kind of finding different masculine pieces and making them feminine. Like cool oxfords.": "Kat",
  "Sometimes fashion designers will be like, 'This is what's hot right now, and you will be cool if you wear this,' but sometimes it's too expensive or doesn't look good on me or isn't who I am, and I don't need to just think that what you're saying is what's cool if I have my own identity.": "Kat",
  "I love a cool bralette paired with a high-waisted jean, maybe with Chanel suspenders and a good platform shoe.": "Kat",
  "I haven't took no punishment. There's nothing cool about taking punishment.": "Floyd",
  "Ali was a threat because he was a voice, and the people hated Ali when he was a voice, but once Ali could no longer speak and he wasn't a voice, they loved him. Love me now. I don't want to be loved if I could barely walk or barely talk. That's not cool.": "Floyd",
  "It's just a really cool deal to be a character in 'WWE 2K17.' Whether it's competing on Nitro or Halloween Havoc, to have me as an available character... it's a tribute.": "Bill",
  "I remember telling myself when I got to start having artist opportunities, 'Let yourself be a fan, because you are. The minute that you walk in a room with Carrie Underwood, and you're too cool to freak out, you need to check yourself.' I just let myself be a fan.": "Kelsea",
  "It's been really cool to me to watch someone like Sam Hunt, whose lyrics and roots are in country but you can hear that he listens to Drake and Justin Timberlake - and that's OK. It allows songwriters to be more honest because it's like, 'This is who I'm listening to.'": "Kelsea",
  "It's really cool when, in every genre of music, you can listen to a song and know what era it was from.": "Kelsea",
  "When I entered high school I was an A-student, but not for long. I wanted the fancy clothes. I wanted to hang out with the guys. I went from being an A-student to a B-student to a C-student, but I didn't care. I was getting the high fives and the low fives and the pats on the back. I was cool.": "Ben",
  "Catty is not cool. I can't think of anything less becoming than a man who talks about people behind their backs.": "Meghan",
  "I'm the person friends come to when they want to find the perfect restaurant or boutique hotel on the outskirts of Paris. As opposed to scouring the Internet for a travel guide, wouldn't you rather ask the people who are really cool who go there? That's what I do.": "Meghan",
  "I don't want to judge, but I've also met women who think it's cool to be out or away from their baby, and I don't get that.": "Kourtney",
  "The '90s was a decade of mundane market-consumer nothingness where there was nothing coming up from the streets you just had someone in an office deciding what was cool. ": "Irvine",
  "Because of my job, I get a lot of opportunity to grab a few days here and there in many cool cities for press commitments, magazine shoots and premieres - Barcelona, Madrid, Rome, Paris, Stockholm, New York, Berlin. I always try to get to a gallery or museum if there's time.": "Natalie"
