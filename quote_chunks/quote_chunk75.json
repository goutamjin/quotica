In those mirrors, the minds of men, in those pools of uneasy water, in which cloud forever and shadows form, dreams persisted; and it was impossible to resist the strange intimation which every gull, flower, tree, man and woman, and the white earth itself seemed to declare (but if you questioned at once to withdraw) that good triumph, happiness prevails, order rules, or to resist the extra ordinary stimulus to range hither and thither in search of some absolute good, some crystal of intensity remote from the known pleasures and familiar virtues, something alien to the processes of domestic life, single, hard, bright, like a diamond in the sand which would render the possessor secure.

Our attitudes and opinions change we develop new habits and eccentricities; but that's something different, more like decoration. Perhaps character resembles intelligence, except that the character peaks a little later;between twenty and thirty, say. And after that we're just stuck with what we've got. We're on our own.

  "I got interested in the idea that love is often used as a kind of blanket explanation for things. I mean, battered wives, for instance: \"Why did you go back to him?\" \"Oh, I loved him.\" \"Why did you embezzle fifteen million pounds and run away to the other side of the world?\" \"Oh, well, because I was in love.\" All that and then you don't ask anything else. I thought if I just say, these people needed love and they found it, then it kind of explained it away. I wanted to look at their behaviour and how love can inspire the best and the very worst in human behaviour but love itself is not behaviour. So I avoided the word 'love' until the very end and it's the last word in the novel. I wanted to explore what people will do when they're in such terrible need of love. If there was a big idea then that was it. Then, of course, I hope that if it's a story worth reading it's the characters themselves who make you want to read it, not the big idea. I don't think a big idea drives a novel usually. Something else has to engage you on a much more kind of personal level. ": "Morag",

  "Vanity is by far my favorite of all sins, and the camera lens is the ultimate vanity mirror. The camera captures all moods and nuances; immortalizes the soft and silky continuum that is humanity. Those still life moments seem so fluid, so representative of continuity. They are a single moment captured, yet an eternity expressed. All your youth; all your ages, captured and expressed in a single click. Of all the indulgences, vanity is certainly my favorite which we should otherwise resist, but are inexplicably captivated by and addicted. What other animal would spend so much time pouting and preening for its reflection? Only humanity would participate in such self-adoration. You would think we have the most colorful feathers or softest of manes. Rather, we are a naked biped that feels incomplete without some decorative element, accessory, or embellishment of the self. We are intoxicated by the image of the body, no different than we are seduced by fine wines, foods, or mind altering elements. We devour the skin, and peel away clothes as if they were the skin of some tropical fruit, covering a colorful and juicy interior. We hunt for bodily pleasures, and collect them as prizes; show them off in social situations as if our companions were some sort of extended adornment to ourselves. We are revealed in our sensuality. To touch beneath the surface; to connect beyond facades, that unattainable discourse between individuals is put tentatively within reach in intimacy. To capture those moments is to capture the essence of what makes us human, and what ultimately sets us above and aside from the rest of nature. Capturing humanity in its most extravagant expressions is intoxicating. Vanity is by far my favorite sin, and it is an endless tale as infinite as humanity. Every person is but a stitch in a giant tapestry.": "A.E.",

  "By appealing to his imagination, a pornographic novel brings the reader\u2019s body into play; libertine fiction appeals only to his mind. The goal of the former is erotic pleasure, or rather the desire to experience erotic pleasure, which the pornographic novel, obviously, cannot satisfy by itself. It is in this regard merely an intermediary, a stimulant, a kind of literary pimp.With libertine fiction, the goal is that of overcoming the prejudices of some of the characters, which are assumed to be the same as those of the reader.

  "We stepped in, and, as we paid the cover charge, the music hit us. The double doors buzzed open and we walked in. A handsome man and his lover in an orange top snuggled as they walked to the exit. Veronica turned to me and smiled, taking my hand. I unbuttoned my shirt at the neck and exposed my collar. It was a thin metal collar with a padlock on the front. If the padlock wasn\u2019t attached it would have looked like any other interesting necklace that was tight against my neck, but it got more interesting with the padlock. \tOn Veronica\u2019s left hand there was a thick bracelet, and that had a key on it. Her right wrist had a glow bracelet. We walked past the tables of people as they drank and screamed over the music to talk. We decided to go right to the dance floor. She took me by the hand, led me.\tWe were on the dance floor and I couldn\u2019t dance. I ended up just throwing myself around, getting lost in the people surrounding us. The bodies pressed against us, the industrial music loud and crisp. The bass shook your bones, and my ribcage felt like it was rattled to pieces. I closed my eyes and just moved. Veronica moved with a grace I hadn\u2019t seen in awhile when I opened my eyes. She pressed herself against a couple that surrounded her. I felt my breath catch in my throat, my heart pounded from excitement. She squeezed past them and moved to me, her hands ran down my face, and then she gripped the padlock with her left hand.\tShe pulled me down to her, which wasn\u2019t very far, but it was the intensity of the moment that made all the difference. What she did next made me jump, my body tensed and relaxed in milliseconds. She gave me a deep kiss, and, while she kissed me, distracted me, her other hand undid my padlock. I pulled back as I jumped in shock. Our eyes were locked on each others\u2019 in the flashing neon stage lights. She had a twinkle in her eye as she pulled me close to her.\t\u201cFind a man, for you.\u201d\tI pulled back, looked at her in surprise. She smiled wickedly, an erotic edge to her features suddenly.

  "Ghost shook his head as he sat on the very edge of the bed, poised to take flight if need be. The spiral under his hair felt warm, almost painful, but he resisted the urge to rub it. It never helped when he did, and he was not sure what Gerry would do if the man saw it. The Witch had a symbol she called a triskele, the ink a vivid scarlet still, but no male that had ever come for healing bore a mark like hers, or like his.

  "Jeffrey woke up, tied to the high-backed chair in his bedroom, nude. He could hear his wife giggling in the hallway, the hardwood floors creaking with her footsteps with what must have been someone else too. He was gagged, a tight cloth wrapped around his mouth, hurting his jaw when he tried to call for help. He looked down at his body, seeing that he was tied with an intricate rope pattern - a pentagram - on his chest, the hemp fibers tight. He could breathe fine, and he recognized his wife\u2019s rigging skills instantly. They\u2019d practiced Kinbaku, a rope bondage before, on multiple occasions, but this rigging was different. It seemed to be tighter than normal, and he knew that something new was being introduced tonight.": "Todd",
  "I was in a copse of pine trees, and the pine was overpowering my scent. The pheromones of the big cat mingled with the pine and I spun around. I was smelling and looking for the flash of white, but I couldn\u2019t see it. I grew angry and I pawed at the earth. The aroma of the soil cleansed my nose as I leaned down and sniffed deeply. I slowly closed and opened my eyes. As I looked ahead I saw something. \tThere, further on, I had another glimpse of the large white cat. She was stopped and her hindquarters were in the air. I stared, trying to figure out what she was doing. Her forepaws and head were on the ground, but her hind was wiggling. She was next to a tree, marking it, so I slowly paced in a zigzag pattern as I walked close to her. I was being cautious because poachers had been known to employ shifters to entice real animals in the wild. She turned her head and growled at me. I took it as an invite to come closer. I ran up to her and started circling. She was an albino panther as I thought. I paced closer, breathing deep. I was in the middle of Ohio, outside of a lost cougar and a few bobcats there were no big cats here, at least not counting lycanthropes, and this creature didn\u2019t smell like one of those. Her rump almost wagged in anticipation, and I felt my tiger body respond.\tI circled her, taking a swipe in her direction to see if she was going to respond negatively to me. The pink eyes followed me and she growled. I walked up to her, sniffed her face and neckline. I didn\u2019t smell any other male on her, and I walked to her raised rump. Burying my nose in her groin I smelled deeper, and she shifted her body. \tI felt it before I could see it. She was shifting, changing from albino panther to human. I sat on my hindquarters as I watched. Her white fur seemed to melt from her, sliding upwards, starting with her back legs. The flesh and fur on her feet slid forward, leaving human feet and calves. It was fully fleshed, unlike some lycanthrope changes when they\u2019re younger. The calves of her legs appeared, and slowly slid up. The panther flesh was sliding forward, slowly and methodically. Across her ass and groin, now lower back and stomach. The pheromones I smelled earlier were coming from her, the human form. I stood and started pacing behind her, and her panther head shook in a very human gesture. I stopped, fighting the desire to lean forward and lick her wetness with my large tongue. The flesh was sliding forward and as her teats turned into breasts, I growled in need. Next were her shoulders and arms, then her head and hands. As the transformation ended, there was a pile of fur and flesh lying in front of her. Her human form was beautiful; a full figured woman with long white hair, that was perfectly natural. She looked to be in her early forties, but didn\u2019t have a line on her face that she didn\u2019t want. In the corners of her eyes were small, but beautiful, crow\u2019s feet, laugh lines surrounded her mouth. She laid out with her former form under her, laying on it, propped up by her elbows. She smiled with the confidence of someone who was used to being in charge. Her long hair flowed around her shoulders, framing her body. She reminded me of someone, but I couldn\u2019t figure out who.": "Todd",

  "After a torrent of rapid knocking, Lucy swept past her in the hallway, threw her purse on the table, and landed her ass on the couch before turning expectantly toward Riley and patting the couch next to her.

  "I don\u2019t want to talk about it,\u201d she said. Once again he was close. Too close. So damn close. \u201cAt all,\u201d she added, hearing with some alarm that her voice had softened. Everything had softened, at just his proximity. \u201cEver,\u201d she whispered, and found her gaze locked on his mouth.He had a really great mouth.\u201cI don\u2019t want to talk, either,\u201d that mouth said very seriously. And then he lowered his head and kissed her.": "Jill",
  "She had no idea how long they kissed\u2014and kissed\u2014but she didn\u2019t think about stopping until she ran out of air. Breathing hard, she slowly opened her eyes and stared directly into his.They\u2019d heated. Darkened. And something else. He wasn\u2019t looking so relaxed now. In fact, he was looking the opposite of relaxed. He looked\u2026feral.And she was his prey.": "Jill",
  "Murmuring soothing noises, Dallas settled himself between her thighs and pressed a soft kiss to her clit. \"You're all right.\" He eased the second sphere out of her. \"I've got you.\" She laughed and covered her face with her hands. \"No, you don't. I can't stop spinning.\" He dropped another kiss, this time to her inner thigh. \"Nothing wrong with spinning.\" One final tug and another full-body shudder from Lex, and he tossed the toy aside. \"I'll catch you, love. I'll always catch you.\" \"Will you?\" She traced his jaw. \"Even when you're spinning with me?\" \"Especially then.": "Kit",
  "You gently lift my chin with one finger and stare deep into my eyes. Automatically I drop my gaze to avoid eye contact with you, but not before I see the debauchery loaded in your expression.\u201cWhose slut are you?\u201d you ask, \u201cand you have permission to look at me whilst you reply.\u201dI glance up at you quickly and take a moment to absorb your beautiful face before you deprive me of it again.\u201cI am your slut, Master \u2013 only yours.\u201dYour eyes burn into mine and you too pause to relish your utter possession of me.": "Felicity",
  "As I am still on duty at this moment, is there anything else I can do for you?\u201d he continues.Images of him kissing me, disrobing me and fondling my entire body fill my mind\u2026 I push them away, although I know my face has coloured at the thought.\u201cI have a few suggestions\u2026\u201d I murmur quietly, staring into his smouldering blue eyes. \u201cBut I am not sure they fall into a butler\u2019s remit.\u201d\u201cPerhaps you\u2019d be surprised at the lengths I\u2019m prepared to go to in order to keep you happy, madam,\u201d he replies, winking at me.": "Felicity",
  "Come over here and taste me,\u201d he says, his voice little but a seductive whisper.": "Felicity",
  "He headed for the stairs, pulling me along behind him. He was forceful, yet took the steps at a slow pace so I did not stumble. It was an overwhelming experience, heightened by the fact he didn\u2019t speak, nor once look back at me.": "Lorraine",
  "They can lick you, darling. They can stroke you and suck you and pet you, but they can't have you. The only question now is how many times I'm gonna watch you come before I get my cock in you.": "Kit",

This time I\u2019m employing a bit of dramatic license, I think. \u201cOr until you came all over me \u2013 because you know, you could do that if you wanted to. I could undo my nightie, and then you could just \u2026 spurt all over my tits.\u201d He makes the following sound: \u201cHoh.": "Charlotte",
  "The thing is, how do you expect to fuck dirty if you can\u2019t even talk it?": "Julia",
  "Straddling him intimately, he slides his hands up my thighs, pushing the silk aside and caressing my pale, exposed skin. Even against his uniform, I can feel his hardness. His body feels taut and poised for action.": "Felicity",
  "It rubs against me, dipping between my hot lips and makes me whimper with yearning. You remove it dramatically and raise it up, out of my eye line, although I imagine that you are inspecting it.\u201cYes, definitely a slut, aren\u2019t you?\u201d\u201cYes, sir.\u201d I reply instantly. My voice sounds needy \u2013 already.": "Felicity",
  "He stands, loosening his black tie and stripping off his white shirt, dropping the latter just in front of my face. The appetizing smell of him reaches my face in a goading wave. As he walks around my body to the bed, he slaps my ass, making me turn and yelp.": "Felicity",

It is an appropriate question and yet he makes it sound like a scorching proposal\u2026\u201cMmmm, please,\u201d is all I manage in reply.I watch him filling the crystal flutes one at a time. He is meticulous and seems to deliberately take a long time to complete the job. The room is silent \u2013 except, it seems, for the sounds of my excited breathing. \u201cIs there anything else I can do to help you enjoy your stay?\u201d he probes, raising one dark eyebrow ever so slightly...": "Felicity",
  "She saw each of the men enter the room and look her up and down. One by one their eyes followed her, watching her every move. Suddenly she ripped the covers off the bed and laid down on it, turned and looked back at them longingly, silently communicating with her actions and expectant stare that she was ready.": "A.L.",
  "You land a second strike, this time just on my left cheek. It feels hard already and stings like hell. I imagine the red mark it has left on my behind as I thank you. As the belt catches my right buttock, I squeeze my eyes shut. I know my tears are close. You strike me again and again. You vary the location and the intensity; somehow never letting me settle into a pattern with the pain. I try to keep count in mind, but after fifteen I am lost in the hot, stinging sensation of my behind.": "Felicity",

She\u2019s wearing black stockings and short heels, and I\u2019m curious to see if she\u2019s wearing a garter belt under there. Her thick brown hair falls to her shoulders and her large brown eyes make her look innocent and doe-like. \u201cCome in,\u201d I say opening the door wide and stepping aside. Lexi hesitates for a second then comes in, looking around at our small studio apartment. The room is dimly lit by shaded lamps, letting most of the light come in through the uncurtained windows. I can see the full moon framed against one pane. In the center of the room is our four-poster king sized bed. Eric is lying on the red silk sheets.": "Marketa",

  "He was quite possibly the most desirable man she had ever had the good fortune to lay her eyes upon and she had to meet him like this. Life was not fair. A groan of frustration left her lips as her body began to heat once more, blood pumping furiously through her. Oh no, she thought, this cannot be happening yet again.

Achingly slow, he sunk two thick fingers inside her. \u201cIf I could go back and do one thing differently that first night, I would taste your virgin pussy before I fucked you. I bet it would have been extra sweet.": "Tessa",
  "I had to have her, and I did. She got on her knees when I told her to. She slipped easily into play and out again, becoming her witty, intelligent self seamlessly. She wasn't intimidated by me.

It was something she was becoming adept at, since her father had brought him into the household and given him the task of keeping watch over her all day, every day, and sleeping across the threshold to her chamber every night. But it was no use. Even with her head turned she could feel his dark eyes upon her.Deep dark pools that drew her into their depths, making her skin burn and her heart flutter. The one and only time she\u2019d made the mistake of gazing into those eyes she\u2019d paid the price, losing her wits entirely for several heartbeats. The man was handsome in a rugged way, his body hard and strong like a warrior\u2019s should be, but it was more than that.There was something . . . Was it the look of him, the scent of him, the taste of him? Not that she\u2019d touched his skin with her tongue yet, but she\u2019d thought about it. At night, in her chamber, in her luxurious bed with its furs and curtains, all alone with him outside her door. Oh yes, Melina had the makings of a sensual woman and that was the trouble.": "Evie",

Phillipe scooted off the edge of the mattress to kneel on the floor between her spread thighs. Damn, she's soaked. Her thighs were glistening from her excitement.

  "When people say, \u2018But what is acceptable in erotica?\u2019 I sometimes answer them by saying: there are certain taboos and limits in writing about sex as a positive, enjoyable, blissful, exciting activity.

He commands me to look at him and I can\u2019t stop.\u201cI ask the questions, Regina.\u201d The cadence is smooth, but there is an undercurrent of threat.He called me Regina, only Ezra calls me Regina. The one that was upset when I fled to the bathroom is the childlike Ezra- he probably would call me Regina, too. Master Ez calls me Queen. The true Ezra is a combination of both- an integrated personality. He\u2019s the one talking to me. Why is HE looking at me like that?\u201cI don\u2019t understand that look, Ezra,\u201d I mumble.\u201cAs I\u2019ve said over and over, we are one in the same- Master Ez and I.\u201d He sighs like he gets sick of pointing out that fact.\u201cUm- yeah\u2026 but Master Ez loves ladies and they\u2019re missing an appendage for you to enjoy,\u201d I tease because anything else would scare the shit out of me.\u201cRegina, Regina,\u201d he laughs. \u201cThe Ezra I used to be liked boys.

  "In the past I was a vicious hunter. I would stalk my prey with pinpoint accuracy. Ever since Monica came into my life I\u2019ve abstained from the game. It almost feels strange to stand here and look to the crowd knowing I could pick one and f*ck them into oblivion. I won\u2019t though. I may love her, but that isn\u2019t the reason. If I were to pick someone for the sake of revenge sex then I\u2019m giving control to Monica and Dalton for betraying me. I\u2019m strong enough to wait. A good hunter is always patient and never stalks in anger.''I always crack it until Tobias stops flinching at the sound. It\u2019s never the same amount of times. I don\u2019t want it to become obvious so I always do it a few more times to create a sense of surprise.I coil up the leather and with the flick of my wrist I set a perfect line against Monica\u2019s back. She yelps in pain and surprise, and Tobias joins her. He thought he\u2019d get the first blow.I breathe through the pounding in my cock. It beats in time with my rapidly beating heart.I flick my wrist again taking Monica across the shoulder. I see Tobias tense as she screams. Mustn\u2019t allow the slaves to think they are taking even turns. The blow\u2019s shock is what makes my cock burn for release. I palm my balls as they tighten, threatening to shoot my release up the stock of my dick. I inhale through my nose and breathe out my mouth until I regain my control.I flick my wrist again and hit Monica across her thighs. She screams bloody murder at the ceiling and I smile to myself. It hurts like a bitch, but the marks will fade. I never break skin. This is my passion- my gift.": "Erica",

  "What do we have here?\u201d Grant slurs at me. He seems different and it raises flags in my mind. His fingers wrap around a section of my hair and it scares me. His face is flushed red and his eyes are glassy and bright. I can smell the smoky scent of whiskey or scotch rolling off his tongue as he speaks and breathes heavily.\u201cI\u2019m lost and I need a ride home.\u201d My voice wavers as I speak and I hate it. I fist my hands in the hem of my blazer.\u201cI\u2019ll get Albert for you, but first spend some time with me,\u201d he slurs again, sounding like his tongue is too large for his mouth. As if sensing my attention, the tip of his tongue sneaks out and slides along his supple bottom lip. He smiles as he tastes the alcohol that\u2019s staining his mouth. His eyes are bright and shiny and glazed over. He has a smirk on his face that shows off his dimple. It no longer reminds me of Whitt. It seems sinister and dangerous- promising something I\u2019m not ready to experience.The feel of his fingers playing with my hair gives me goosebumps and I shiver as my scalp tightens, sucking up the pleasant attention. I do my first stupid-girl moment of my life. I shameless crush on a guy and let it turn my thoughts to mush.\u201cOkay, if you promise to call Albert first.\u201d I try to negotiate with him and he gives me a naughty smirk for agreeing.He backs me up with his physical presence. His front touches mine- chest-to-chest. His lips part and breathes the smoky, whiskey scent onto my chin. My back hits the door behind me with an audible thump. He reaches around me and I don\u2019t wince. I anticipate him touching me and crave it. Instead, his hand twists the doorknob by my hip and I fall backwards.I\u2019m pushed into a dark room until my legs connect with the edge of a bed. I can\u2019t see anything, and the only sound is our combined breathing. I feel alive with caution. I\u2019m aware of every hair, every nerve on my flesh.

  "As I rock down the hall I am flung from my path- snatched and grabbed. Before I can even utter a word, a large palm is covering my mouth. In less than five seconds I am inside a pitch black room, pushed face first into a cold metal door, and I hear the lock snick into place. A heavy weight presses at my back. I didn\u2019t even have time to panic. It was a well-timed attack.My mind flashes to another time and place, another hand on my mouth. I breathe though the panic that tries to overcome me.I allow my senses to put me at ease. He\u2019s just softly breathing near my ear. His body is relaxed. The way he holds me feels more playful than threatening.\u201cLet me guess\u2026 the Boss,\u201d I say to the heavy weight at my back. My tone is a mix of amused annoyance.": "Erica",
  "As I finished my rice, I sketched out the plot of a pornographic adventure film called The Massage Room. Sirien, a young girl from northern Thailand, falls hopelessly in love with Bob, an American student who winds up in the massage parlor by accident, dragged there by his buddies after a fatefully boozy evening. Bob doesn't touch her, he's happy just to look at her with his lovely, pale-blue eyes and tell her about his hometown - in North Carolina, or somewhere like that. They see each other several more times, whenever Sirien isn't working, but, sadly, Bob must leave to finish his senior year at Yale. Ellipsis. Sirien waits expectantly while continuing to satisfy the needs of her numerous clients. Though pure at heart, she fervently jerks off and sucks paunchy, mustached Frenchmen (supporting role for Gerard Jugnot), corpulent, bald Germans (supporting role for some German actor). Finally, Bob returns and tries to free her from her hell - but the Chinese mafia doesn't see things in quite the same light. Bob persuades the American ambassador and the president of some humanitarian organization opposed to the exploitation of young girls to intervene (supporting role for Jane Fonda). What with the Chinese mafia (hint at the Triads) and the collusion of Thai generals (political angle, appeal to democratic values), there would be a lot of fight scenes and chase sequences through the streets of Bangkok. At the end of the day, Bob carries her off. But in the penultimate scene, Sirien gives, for the first time, an honest account of the extent of her sexual experience. All the cocks she has sucked as a humble massage parlor employee, she has sucked in the anticipation, in the hope of sucking Bob's cock, into which all the others were subsumed - well, I'd have to work on the dialogue. Cross fade between the two rivers (the Chao Phraya, the Delaware). Closing credits. For the European market, I already had line in mind, along the lines of \"If you liked The Music Room, you'll love The Massage Room.": "Michel",
  "My eyes glue to him in fascination as he cleans his flogger. He\u2019s shirtless since the room is above comfortable temperature. I watch as a drop of sweat creates a path down his back, gliding around all those perfect striated muscles. The drop disappears beneath his low-slung, leather pants. A shiver rocks my body at the thought of it sliding down the crack of his bitable ass.\u201cKatya, snap your mouth shut, close the door, and have a seat,\u201d Dexter commands and I listen.": "Erica",
  "Cassie,\u201d I growl at the young brunette. \u201cHow\u2019s the sobriety?\u201dAlex brought the submissive to us. She\u2019s an addict that he councils at Transcend. I don\u2019t want to be mean to her right now, especially since my best friend brought her here, but I\u2019m furious and she\u2019s an outlet. She can\u2019t strike back.\u201cNinety days sober,\u201d she says with pride.\u201cThat\u2019s awesome,\u201d I say enthusiastically and smile at her. \u201cI love how we have to give fuck ups a medal when they behave. I would think it should go to those who never fuck up. What\u2019s the incentive to behave if all you have to do is get shit-faced and steal shit for years and then ninety days on the straight-and-narrow we have to pat you on the back for being a good girl,\u201d I say in a saccharine voice.She gazes at me with huge, glassy brown eyes. I can see the tears forming. Cassie worries her full bottom lip between her teeth and tries not to blink.\u201cBut hey, what do I know. It just seems like the system is flawed. The good little boys and girls just don\u2019t get the recognition that a crack-whore thief gets,\u201d I shrug.Cassie blinks and the surface of her tears breaks and they finally slide down her cheeks in shame.\u201cBut go you!\u201d I shout sarcastically. I give her a thumbs up and walk down the hall.\u201cCold\u2026 that was just cold, dude,\u201d Alex chuckles at me.That was so bad that I have to laugh or I\u2019d puke. I shake my head as my belly contracts from laughter.\u201cScore on my newest asshattery?\u201d I ask my partner in crime. If I didn\u2019t have him I\u2019d scream. I\u2019ll owe Master Marcus forever. He stripped me bare until Font was naked in the impact room at Brownstone I trained in. Alex walked in and shook my hand- instant best friend.\u201cAh\u2026\u201d He taps his chin in thought and the bastard tucks his black hair behind his ear. I growl at him because he did it on purpose. He knows how much I miss the feel of my hair swinging at my jawline.Alex arches a perfect brow above his aqua eye and smirks. He runs his hands through his hair and groans in pleasure.\u201c8.5. It was a decent attempt, but you pulled your hit. You\u2019re too soft. I bet you were scared you\u2019d make her relapse.\u201d\u201cYeah,\u201d I say bashfully.\u201cNot happening, bud. I\u2019m just that fucking good. I better go do some damage control. Don\u2019t hurt any more subs. Pick on the big bastards. They may bite back, but their egos are delicate.": "Erica",
  "Gentleman,\u201d I purr smoothly in greeting.Ezra and Cort circle me like sharks scenting blood. I know who they are, but not who is who since they\u2019re wearing black hoods over their heads. It covers them to the shoulder and has holes for the eyes and mouth. Their clothing is identical Italian designer label suits. Even their shoes are the same. Their eyes glow like steel ball-bearings from the safety of their masks. The mouths are different- one serious, one snarky- both ruby-red and kissable.While they circle Fate and me several times taking our measure, the other Master stands in a sphere of his own confidence. He\u2019s older and I don\u2019t mean just in age, but knowledge. Ezra and Cortez feel like babies compared to this man. I bet he\u2019s who I really have to impress.I wait, always meeting their eyes when their path moves them back to my face. I don\u2019t follow them with my gaze- I wait.\u201cHello,\u201d the hood with the serious lips speaks in a smooth deep tone. I know it\u2019s not his true voice, but the one Kris calls The Boss. His eyes are kind and assessing.No one pays Fate any mind as she cowers at my thigh. I hold their undivided attention. Curly-locks is quiet- watchful- a predator sighting its quarry. Snarky mouth is leering at my chest and I smirk. Caught ya, Cortez Abernathy.\u201cI seem to be at a disadvantage conversing with you while you\u2019re hooded. I can\u2019t see you, but you can see me.\u201d I try to get them to out themselves. It\u2019s a longshot.\u201cAnd who are you, Ma\u2019am?\u201d Ezra asks respectfully.\u201cPlease call me Queen.\u201d I draw on all of my lessons from Hillbrook to pull me through this conversation. The power in the air is stifling. I wonder if it\u2019s difficult for them to be in the same room without having a cage match for dominance. I feel like I\u2019m on Animal Planet and the lions are circling.\u201cQueen, indeed,\u201d Cort says snidely under his breath and I wince. I turn my face from them in embarrassment.I should have gone with something less- less everything. I know I\u2019m strong, but the word also emulates elegance and beauty. I\u2019m neither. Have to say, tonight has sucked for my self-esteem. First, the dominant one overlooks me for Fate and now Cortez makes fun of me- lovely.\u201cWhat did you say to upset her?\u201d Ezra accuses Cortez.\u201cNothing,\u201d Cort complains in confusion.\u201cPlease excuse my partner. Words are his profession and it seems they have failed him this evening. I will apologize for not sharing our names, but this gentleman is Dexter.\u201d He gestures to the dominant man. I wait for him to shake my hand like a civilized person. He does not- he actually crosses his arms over his chest in disobedience. This shit is going to be a piece of cake.": "Erica",

My elbow might be badly bruised, but it wasn\u2019t broken. His eyes followed mine and he sighed. \u201cThat was an accident.\u201d His tan, sinewy hand touched my wrist then delicately ran down my bones to my elbow.

  "-Now the paperwork \u2013\t-What if I don\u2019t want to do the Ultimate, right away? Maybe I want to ease into this thing gently.-No you don\u2019t.-I might. I might just want to ease into the activity, the idea of it.-it\u2019ll be fine, said Rebecca.-you will be fine, and no regrets, honestly. Jillian took me over to the desk.-No possible regrets, said Rebecca, just sign this, she handed me a sheaf of forms.-Jesus I don\u2019t want to buy the place, I scanned the pages \u2013 45 pages.-just fill in page 25 through28 and sign.-Pages 25 through 28, what is this?Rebecca took the pages of forms from my hand \u2013 look its simple stuff, here we\u2019ll read it through. Jillian looked over her shoulder at the pages-weight?-what?- Say 110, Jillian said.-Height?-5\u2019 8\u2019\u2019, Jillian again.-Hair length?-What? Why?-Long, Jillian again.-Cup size?- O come on.- say C-how about say nothing, I was getting angry-Shaved or bikini or natural?-Fuck offRebecca ticked a box anyway \u2013 well she was at the waxing too. Why ask in fact?-Last menstrual cycle?- enough, enough, give me those papers-Yes ignore that, said Rebecca taking the pages away from my grasping hand-Tested? she said this to Jillian-Tested? What tested? What do you mean tested?-Yes, said Jillian, I forwarded a blood sample from the main island-You what!-You were sleeping.-Great now sign here, Rebecca handed me a page and a pen-Who has blood samples for a theme park?-Everyone-especially the staff, can\u2019t have mi\u2019lady getting STDsI took a breath-This is getting a bit weird guys are you sure?

  "The male staff all wore gorgeous colored loin cloths that always seem to be about to fall off they\u2019re wonderful hips. Their upper bodies were tanned sculpted and naked.The female staff wore short shorts and silky flowing tops that almost but didn\u2019t expose their young easy breasts. I noticed we only ever encountered male staff, and the men walking through the lobby were always greeted by the female staff. Very ingenious, as Rebecca said later - if we had ticked Lesbians on the form I wonder what would have happened?\t-There was a place to tick for Lesbians, I said ?\t-Sexual Persuasion- it was on all the forms\t-Really. And, how many options were there?\t-You\u2019re getting the picture, said Jillian.This was not your basic check in procedure as at say a Best Western. Our Doormen/Security Guards , held out our chairs for us to let us sit at the elegant ornate table. Then they poured us tea, and placed before each of us a small bowl of tropical fruit, cut into bite size pieces. Wonderful!Almost immediately a check in person came and sat opposite us at the desk. Again a wonderful example of Island Male talent. (in my mind anyway)We signed some papers, and were each handed an immense wallet of information passes, electronic keys, electronic ID\u2019s we would wear to allow us to move through the park and its \u2018worlds\u2019 and a small flash driveI looked at it as he handed it to me, and given the mindset of the Hotel and the murals and the whole ambiance of the place, I was thinking it might be a very small dildo for, some exotic move I was unaware of. \t-What\u2019s this?

And then slowly closed it, and walked away, hips and heels swaying away from him.I could hear the groan. God, this was powerful.He came up behind me and slid his hand down over the fur, the softness, silkiness of the lining flowed over my naked body, a caress on every inch of my flesh \u2013umm indeed.Now he was sliding his hands up my legs and under the coat.-Aah,Aah not yet, I said and pulled away from him.He moaned again \u2013 Please, he said\u2026": "Germaine",

  "In Russia, the person who put Sevastopol on the literary map was Leo Tolstoy, a veteran of the siege. His fictionalized memoir The Sebastopol Sketches made him a national celebrity. Already with the first installment of the work published, Tsar Alexander II saw the propaganda value of the piece and ordered it translated into French for dissemination abroad. That made the young author very happy. Compared with Tolstoy\u2019s later novels, The Sebastopol Sketches hasn\u2019t aged well, possibly because this is not a heartfelt book. As the twenty-six-year-old Tolstoy\u2019s Sevastopol diaries reveal, not heartache but ambition drove him at the time. Making a name as an author was just an alternative to two other grand plans\u2014founding a new religion and creating a mathematical model for winning in cards (his losses during the siege were massive even for a rich person).": "Constantine",

  "I've thought about that often since. I mean, about the word nice. Perhaps I mean good. Of course they mean nothing, when you start to think about them. A good man, one says; a good woman; a nice man, a nice woman. Only in talk of course, these are not words you'd use in a novel. I'd be careful not to use them.Yet of that group, I will say simply, without further analysis, that George was a good person, and that Willi was not. That Maryrose and Jimmy and Ted and Johnnie the pianist were good people, and that Paul and Stanley Lett were not. And furthermore, I'd bet that ten people picked at random off the street to meet them, or invited to sit in that party under the eucalyptus trees that night, would instantly agree with this classification-would, if I used the word good, simply like that, know what I meant.And thinking about this, which I have done so much, I discover that I come around, by a back door, to another of the things that obsess me. I mean, of course, this question of 'personality.' Heaven knows we are never allowed to forget that the 'personality' doesn't exist any more. It's the theme of half the novels written, the theme of the sociologists and all the other -ologists. We're told so often that human personality has disintegrated into nothing under pressure of all our knowledge that I've even been believing it. Yet when I look back to that group under the trees, and re-create them in my memory,suddenly I know it's nonsense. Suppose I were to meet Maryrose now, all these years later,she'd make some gesture, or turn her eyes in such a way, and there she'd be, Maryrose, and indestructible. Or suppose she 'broke down,' or became mad. She would break down into her components, and the gesture, the movement of the eyes would remain, even though some connection had gone. And so all this talk, this antihumanist bullying, about the evaporation of the personality becomes meaningless for me at that point when I manufacture enough emotional energy inside myself to create in memory some human being I've known. I sit down, and remember the smell of the dust and the moonlight, and see Ted handing a glass of wine to George, and George's over-grateful response to the gesture. Or I see, as in a slow-motion film, Maryrose turn her head, with her terrifyingly patient smile... I've written the word film. Yes. The moments I remember all have the absolute assurance of a smile, a look, a gesture, in a painting or a film. Am I saying then that the certainty I'm clinging to belongs to the visual arts, and not to the novel, not to the novel at all, which has been claimed by the disintegration and the collapse? What business has a novelist to cling to the memory of a smile or a look, knowing I so well the complexities behind them? Yet if I did not, I'd never be able to set a word down on paper; just as I used to keep myself from going crazy in this cold northern city by deliberately making myself remember the quality of hot sunlight on my skin.And so I'll write again that George was a good man.": "Doris",

This triangle of manifestation is one of the secrets of many religions: Scientology, Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism. In Masonry is seen as \"heart, mind and desire\"; in Scientology is perceived as \"reality, communication and emotions\"; basically, \"actions, learnings and affinity\". In Christianity, is the \"Father, son and holy ghost\". Father equals reality or Creator of the illusion; The son is the way, the path, our decisions and actions; The holy ghost is our heart, instincts and desires. In word words, through Jesus, and with the power of the Holy Ghost, you reach God. This is an allegory that most Christians can't understand.

  "It probably seems obvious, but as an editor, I love stories. But it\u2019s a little bit more than that. I intensely believe that stories have power. They can spark an idea, or a realization. They can, by just offering another perspective, change a person\u2019s mind. They can make us weep and cry and care. And they can connect us. That\u2019s powerful stuff.": "Mariah",

  "...with a click, my novel would be born; it would come out into the light suddenly transformed from the hypothetical text composed in my imagination into finished, tangible thing with a real and independent existence. The moment of clicking on the print button always gave rise to strange and powerful ambivalence--a combination of self-satisfaction, gloom and anxiety. Self-satisfaction for having finished writing the book. Gloom because taking my leave of the characters has the same effect on me as when a group of friends have to depart. And anxiety, perhaps because I am on the verge of delivering up into other people's hands something that I treasure.": "Alaa",

  "On writing, my advice is the same to all. If you want to be a writer, write. Write and write and write. If you stop, start again. Save everything that you write. If you feel blocked, write through it until you feel your creative juices flowing again. Write. Writing is what makes a writer, nothing more and nothing less. \u2014 Ignore critics. Critics are a dime a dozen. Anybody can be a critic. Writers are priceless. \u2014 Go where the pleasure is in your writing. Go where the pain is. Write the book you would like to read. Write the book you have been trying to find but have not found. But write. And remember, there are no rules for our profession. Ignore rules. Ignore what I say here if it doesn\u2019t help you. Do it your own way. \u2014 Every writer knows fear and discouragement. Just write. \u2014 The world is crying for new writing. It is crying for fresh and original voices and new characters and new stories. If you won\u2019t write the classics of tomorrow, well, we will not have any. Good luck.": "Anne",

So if you're not a writer, consider yourself fortunate.": "Samuel",
  "I\u2019m an observer. I am fascinated by people and how their minds work (and, of course, my own). Why we are the way we are, why we do the things we do \u2013 and that interest drives my writing. I was a physicist before fiction claimed my soul, so I\u2019m an experimenter. I\u2019m open to different ways of thinking. I like exaggerating, making things up. I\u2019m a very open, honest person in life and that\u2019s the way it should be, but when it comes to fiction, I want to pour a few sharp objects into the comfort zone. Our fears are powerful, yet we\u2019ve all got a desire to laugh and be entertained. I could have followed the same path I do now as a scientist, examining how the brain works. Ironically I get much more freedom to experiment as a writer. That\u2019s why I love it.": "Carla",

Then I get up and throw them out and start from the beginning. And if I knock off from this routine for as long as a day, I\u2019m frantic with boredom . . .": "Philip",

  "Writing is like a blind man building a stone house with a limited amount of space and time. Brick after brick, row after row, feeling his way round and round. Turning stones into walls, rooms and towers. Relentlessly searching for doorways and windows, frequently replacing a stone or two here and there for a tighter fit. Often taking out entire walls that just feel out of place and sometimes, sadly, removing entire rickety rooms.": "Jack",
  "I see Sarah framed in the light of her doorway and it is like looking at a painting that emanate a mixture of wishes and truths about someone I loved - from a time I can already vividly remember.

  "The best thing that can happen to me when I'm writing fiction is to lose sight of the fact that I'm writing at all. It's as though I enter into a kind of trance. I know I'm writing, but I don't THINK about it. I just let my fingers type--it's as though the feeling comes out directly through them, bypassing the brain altogether. When that happens, I feel completely transported. There is nothing else like this feeling, very little else is more important to me. That intimacy I feel between myself and my work is what makes me feel at home on the earth. I am basically a shy person, basically a loner and an outsider; and I have been all my life. But when I achieve the kind of connection I can through writing, I feel I'm sitting in the lap of God.": "Elizabeth",

  "Still writing?\" I usually nod and smile, then quickly change the subject. But here is what I would like to put down my fork and say: Yes, yes, I am.

Even if my fingers were to clench and wither, even if I were to grow deaf or blind, even if I were unable to move a muscle in my body save for the blink of one eye, I would still write. Writing saved my life. Writing has been my window -- flung wide open to this magnificent, chaotic existence -- my way of interpreting everything within my grasp. Writing has extended that grasp by pushing me beyond comfort, beyond safety, past my self-perceived limits. It has softened my heart and hardened my intellect. It has been a privilege. It has whipped my ass. It has burned into me a valuable clarity. It has made me think about suffering, randomness, good will, luck, memory responsibility, and kindness, on a daily basis -- whether I feel like it or not. It has insisted that I grow up. That I evolve. It has pushed me to get better, to be better. It is my disease and my cure. It has allowed me not only to withstand the losses in my life but to alter those losses -- to chip away at my own bewilderment until I find the pattern in it. Once in a great while, I look up at the sky and think that, if my father were alive, maybe he would be proud of me. That if my mother were alive, I might have come up with the words to make her understand. That I am changing what I can. I am reaching a hand out to the dead and to the living and the not yet born. So yes. Yes. Still writing.": "Dani",

As writers' wives and husbands often learn to their horror......there is no way that writers can be tamed and rendered civilized. Or even cured.

So from a very early age, I went to the movies and I soon grew to prefer the life of the movies to my own life. The reality that the movies offered was preferable to the reality that I was experiencing. I became a child movie addict. I would go in with great pleasure and I'd never look at what was playing -- what was playing was unimportant. The fact was that I was entering a new world, an environment where not only was it much more attractive than my life was ordinarily, but also I could manipulate it to an extent by coming and going, and by looking at scenes or not, which I could not in my own life.

By law, every victim is entitled to a paladin and a chase, else life would be cheapened.And the real reason I do this? My brain is simply bent this way. There is nothing else I would rather do.

Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.\u201d-\u201cThe place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications. That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product. Microsoft themselves did this at the start. So did Apple. And Hewlett- Packard. I suspect almost every successful startup has.\u201d-\u201cGreat software, likewise, requires a fanatical devotion to beauty. If you look inside good software, you find that parts no one is ever supposed to see are beautiful too.\u201d-\u201cThe right way to collaborate, I think, is to divide projects into sharply defined modules, each with a definite owner, and with interfaces between them that are as carefully designed and, if possible, as articulated as programming languages. Like painting, most software is intended for a human audience. And so hackers, like painters, must have empathy to do really great work. You have to be able to see things from the user's point of view.\u201d-\u201cIt turns out that looking at things from other people's point of view is practically the secret of success.\u201d-\u201cPart of what software has to do is explain itself.

  "I\u2019m so exhausted with worry, I go to bed early that day. But hours later, I\u2019m still awake. I can\u2019t seem to fall asleep. Not without him by my side. When did I become so addicted to Jake? Why do I crave his company? Since forever, my conscience responds. After my father\u2019s death, I went off the deep end because he was not there. I sought the BDSM lifestyle, not because I yearned for it, but because I wanted the pain. If Jake had been there, somehow I could have muddled through the aftermath of my father\u2019s funeral without looking for someone to tie me up and administer punishment. I wanted to be beaten as an outlet for my agony. Not that it made any difference. Even after I flew to Brazil, the pain was still there. It still is. And I know why. Because he\u2019s not by my side. As much as I want him to be here with me, he never signed on to babysit me for life.": "Magda",

I\u2019m talking about the mantle of responsibility thrust upon you. Hell at fourteen you practically ran the castle. God knows our father never did.

  "As I unbutton him, I kiss his skin\u2014 warm, fragrant, smelling of soap, his expensive cologne and him. Done, I slip him out of the garment and lay over his heart which thuds heavy and deep beneath my breast. Except for my gossamer-thin robe, we're almost skin to skin.": "Magda",

I moved closer and knelt down in front of him, my naked bottom facing the warmth of the fire. I bent my head downwards and looked at the floor as I had been taught, but he surprised me by lifting up my chin with his hand. \u201cYou look so beautiful.\u201dHe bent and kissed me softly on the lips, and I shivered in anticipation.

Oh, good morning by the way.\u201d\u201cFor a prospective sub you are becoming a little demanding.\u201d\u201cSorry, am I not supposed to want sex?\u201d\u201cThere\u2019s absolutely nothing wrong with you wanting sex, in fact it is a condition of you being here in bed with me. It\u2019s just that a good little sub waits to be asked.\u201d\u201cSorry. Then of course I will withdraw that demand and lie here to await your pleasure.\u201d\u201cGood, a fast learner, that\u2019s what I like.": "Rachel",

  "I looked up, and I really wished I hadn\u2019t. My obsession with those eyes was playing a taunting game with me. His mesmerising gaze was like none other I had ever experienced in my life. It was almost as if he could reach into my soul and pick out all of my sins. Sins I didn\u2019t want him to know about. Sins that would ultimately destroy me if they ever got out. If he knew my sins, he wouldn\u2019t be kneeling beside me with my hand in his. He wouldn\u2019t be sharing with me that look of promises to come. He would be disgusted with me.

Did you come to tell me that the crazy fog has lifted and you\u2019re ready to resume your place by my side?\u201d \u201cNot in this lifetime.

You are still my wife. Let\u2019s not forget that, eh?\u201d Bree shook her head. \u201cYou are unbelievable. Do you feel any remorse at all for what you did?\u201d Alessandro clenched his jaw. \u201cI believe I expressed my remorse quite thoroughly if you recall. I begged you to forgive me and I beg for nothing, Brianna. I laid myself bare and pleaded for you to understand but all you had for me were hateful words.\u201d \u201cOh, was I supposed to believe that little performance?\u201d Bree snapped, forcing herself to block out the image of his hands cupping her face, his tears mingling with her own. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to know because I believed you when you looked me in the eye and told me you had nothing to do with what happened to Colin.": "E.",

Part of her wanted to run after him but a stronger part of her knew he wouldn\u2019t listen to anything she had to say while the red haze was still burning inside of him. He wanted a fight. She\u2019d give him one": "E.",
  "What I want you to understand is that when I heard your words, it was as if every single second we had spent together up to that point was a lie. Every word, every touch, every kiss. You were looking at me, but you wanted him. I was this\u2026thing to be endured to keep your family safe. You would allow me to touch you, to make love to you all the while wishing for Colin. I thought all that passion we had between us was a complete figment of my imagination and it was a bitter pill to swallow. I hated you. Worse than I\u2019d ever hated anyone in my life. I was determined to make you pay. I\u2019d keep you shackled to me forever as punishment. Keep you away from your true love.\u201d Bree stared at him, unable to fathom such cruelty. Who was this man she loved that was capable of such a thing? \u201cAnd then?\u201d He took a deep shaky breath and leaned against the edge of the desk, crossing his arms over his chest. \u201cThen I spent all my energy trying to prove to myself by looking at you that you were lying to me, to justify what I was doing by picking up little gestures or flickers in your eyes that would prove to me that you felt nothing for me.\u201d Bree rolled her eyes and gave a tearful snort. \u201cAnd did you, after how hard I fought for you, did you get what you wanted? Did you prove to yourself what a lying bitch I am?\u201d \u201cNo. Of course not. So I started to doubt what I heard.\u201d \u201cAfter living with Bernardo for all your life it had just occurred to you that he just may have tampered with the fucking thing?\u201d Bree bit out, furiously.": "E.",

  "The loud rasp of leather yanked through Carson\u2019s belt loops sent her attention to his torso.\u201cWhat are you doing?\u201d London\u2019s panicked gaze shot to his face.\u201cI don\u2019t have a collar on me.\u201d\u201cI am wholly disinterested in being collared.\u201d\u201cOne weekend, London.\u201d He grasped one of her hips with his free hand. \u201cIf you\u2019re disappointed at any time, you can walk.

No one\u2014and I mean no one\u2014but us will know.\u201d\u201cWould you put that in writing?\u201d Her eyes filled with mischief.Priceless. London lured him toward a lightning storm. He could play. Hell, nothing appealed in the moment more than a weekend playing with London. Yes, this is what he wanted. Now he needed to know if she was willing.\u201cI\u2019ll do one better.\u201d He snaked the belt around her waist until the leather rested against her hips.\u201cI\u2019m not a notch on a belt.\u201d\u201cYou could never be a notch, London Chantelle. You\u2019re the whole belt, sugar.\u201dHer face softened, and the playfulness in her eyes died. He recognized the deliberation behind them, the wonder if she\u2019d be safe, here and at work. London needn\u2019t have worried. She might get scared, but mutual satisfaction was the only way his brand of sexual fulfillment worked.\u201cSay yes or no.\u201d He pressed his torso to her corseted body, the last space between her body and his obliterated. \u201cBut say yes.\u201d\u201cWhat will happen if I say yes?\u201d\u201cWhat you want.

Is you fault!\u201d \u201cI suggest you put a muzzle on your brat and get back in the living room,\u201d Bernardo ordered. \u201cCareful, Father. This is none of your concern,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cAre you kidding me?\u201d Bree asked. \u201cOf course this is his concern because he\u2019s the only one you give a damn about. You\u2019ll do anything for him. Absolutely anything even if it means betraying me or Will or God forbid Gianni.\u201d \u201cThat is not true. I would never\u2014\u201d \u201cIt is true!\u201d Bree yelled. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve done has proven that.\u201d \u201cLook, every marriage has problems and that is no reason to turn back on the vows you made to each other,\u201d Bernardo pointed out. \u201cYou made a promise to honor the terms of the O'Reiley/Dardano vendetta. Be careful before you renege on those vows, Mrs. Dardano.\u201d \u201cYou and your stupid vendetta!\u201d Bree hissed. \u201cBegun by a man who couldn\u2019t handle the fact that he couldn\u2019t have what he wanted! God it must be genetic. Well, I guess I shouldn\u2019t blame you, Alessandro. Knowing Bernardo and Adriano, at least you come by it honestly.": "E.",
  "Hello, darling,\u201d Alessandro smiled at her. Oh, that smile. Bree wanted to close her eyes, press her hands against her eyes and keep them shut forever so she wouldn\u2019t see that smile. She must have had the question on her face, the knowledge on her face because as she looked at him now, something flickered in his eyes. Guilt. Oh God. \u201cMommy, look. I make good bouncies. See?\u201d Will said, dribbling the ball. \u201cI gonna be a basset ball player when I gwoed up.\u201d The little boy\u2019s voice sounded far away as Bree narrowed in on Alessandro and the look in his eyes. \u201cBrian.

Will stopped bouncing the ball and held it against his chest looking at both of them, picking up on the angry tension that suddenly covered them all. \u201cUh oh.

And Carrie.\u201d He looks like a cornered animal. And what do Dardanos do when they\u2019re cornered? They lie. They cheat. Oh God. \u201cFine, then can you just take the boys upstairs?\u201d Bree said, speaking to Brian, but not moving her gaze from her husband. \u201cCome on, guys.

Hell, Bernardo had taught him how to fiddle with electronics when he was still a teenager. And he wanted Alessandro under his control, under his roof.

  "trailed off as her attention moved from Will taking his juice from the bartender to the glass behind the bartender. There were red dots on the glass. Alessandro brushed her shoulder again and Bree followed a row of red dots from the glass mirror to the wall. Some of the red dots danced over the guests and as an icy cloak of understanding fell over Bree, it seemed to grip Alessandro as well. Then she turned to face him and there were red dots on his chest, as well as her shoulder, which he had been brushing, thinking it was a speck of dust. \u201cGET DOWN!\u201d he screamed to everyone grabbing Bree by the waist and throwing her down while and trying to be heard over the music. Chaos erupted as gunfire drowned out the sound of music and people fell screaming on top of each other as pieces of the wall and glass from the doors and the mirrors rained down on them. The gunfire raged on and on for what seemed like an eternity. Then there was silence.": "E.",
  "Like, okay, look up at that cloud and tell me what you see,\u201d Bree said, pointing up at the closest cloud above them. \u201cWhat do you mean, what do I see? It\u2019s a cloud. I see a cloud,\u201d Alessandro insisted. \u201cNo, what do you see? Like when you go to a shrink and they make you look at ink blots,\u201d Bree explained.

I see a rabbit.\u201d \u201cA rabbit?\u201d Alessandro asked, laughing. \u201cYeah, the top of that one is shaped like ears, long rabbit ears.\u201d \u201cAh, I see what you\u2019re doing now. All right then. That one there\u2026looks like\u2026\u201d Alessandro squinted his eyes as if hard in concentration. \u201cAn airplane.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. I see that,\u201d Bree agreed. \u201cOkay, what about that one?\u201d She pointed to a cloud to Alessandro\u2019s right. \u201cThat one looks rather like my wife\u2019s sweet pert little ass,\u201d Alessandro joked. \u201cAfter two kids? You\u2019re delusional,\u201d she said laughing. \u201cMy turn. I think that one looks like\u2026\u201d Bree tilted her head. \u201cMy wife\u2019s beautiful round breasts,\u201d Alessandro injected. \u201cStop that!\u201d Bree said, giggling. \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m just playing the game.\u201d \u201cNo, you\u2019re not. You\u2019re being a horny guy.\u201d Alessandro pressed a hand to his chest as if she had wounded him. \u201cTo prove it to you, I say we compare.\u201d He undid the buttons of her blouse and Bree was laughing too hard to stop him.": "E.",
  "Evan Lucien, if it is my last act upon this Earth,\" he says, his eyes intense and shadowed in the lantern light, \"I will make you come.": "Lilly",
  "Come see my mommy, Becky!\u201d Will said and Bree stopped in her tracks. \u201cOh hell no!\u201d she exclaimed staring at \u2018Becky\u2019. Rebecca, the bane of Bree\u2019s existence. The blonde woman smiled mockingly at Bree. \u201cHow ya doing?\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Bree asked but the question was directed at her brother and not the skank in front of her. \u201cSo how was Paris?\u201d Rebecca asked moving right past Bree to practically press her body against Alessandro. \u201cSeriously, what?\u201d Bree demanded, glaring at Brian. \"Hey, Alessandro. Great to see you again.\" \u201cStop talking. Stop talking now before I ram your botoxed head through this table!\u201d Bree hissed lunging at her. Brian grabbed her quickly and held her back. \u201cSorry. Bree\u2019s a little bit touchy about that whole Vegas thing I guess. But hey, looks like it all worked for the best, huh?\u201d Rebecca winked at Alessandro": "E.",
  "You have that look on your face,\u201d Alessandro said, smiling as he tucked a damp lock of her blonde hair behind her ear. \u201cWhat look?\u201d Bree asked, resting a hand on his flushed chest, propping herself up on one elbow. She could feel the racingheart beneath. \u201cThe look of a woman who\u2019s been rather well fucked, darling,\u201d he grinned smugly. She punched his chest lightly. \u201cEgo much?\u201d \u201cI see nothing wrong with taking pride in a job well done,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cOh of course,\u201d Bree said, laughing and dropped her head on his chest.": "E.",
  "Look, you are my father and I love you. I will always love you. But that love is not an all or nothing proposition. Brianna is my wife. Will and Gianni are my sons. You are all my family, but if you push me, Father, if you force me to choose between you and them you will not like the choice I make. You are never to treat William the way you did today, ever. Am I making myself clear?\u201d \u201cIs that a threat, Alessandro?\u201d Bernardo asked, his voice cold. Bree felt her body stiffen with nervous tension. Her heart was racing, both with nervousness and joy that Alessandro wasdrawing a line in the sand with his father and that he was sticking up for them over Bernardo. \u201cRemember, Father, you raised me. You raised me to be a Dardano. That\u2019s who I am and I\u2019m sure you know exactly what that means.": "E.",
  "I know full well what being a Dardano means and so will Gianni and Will, but I want more for him. I want him to know what it is to laugh and to play and to not feel like the whole world is out to get him, to find joy in simple things and not just how many zeroes are in his bank account. And more than that, I want them both to grow up and know that power is not everything. It is necessary, yes and I will teach them how to squash their enemies, how to hit first before they can destroy you but I will also teach them that without love, without a family, none of it means a good God damn. I want them to be worthy of that love when it comes, and to not be so wrapped up in this legacy and this power that they lose sight of love when it\u2019s right in front of their eyes.": "E.",
  "I sat at the computer and started my BDSM research in earnest. I learned three things: I still very much like the idea of wielding the power, I do seem to have an inclination toward the opposite in spite of myself, and there are some things on the internet that you simply cannot unsee.": "Lilly",
  "Rebecca glared at her. \u201cCongratulations. You just cost me a million dollar account.\u201d Brianna crossed her arms over her chest. \u201cOh don't worry. I'm sure with your talents you could earn another mil in no time. I'll tell them to clear a street corner for you.\u201d Rebecca lunged for her and Alessandro stepped between the two women. \u201cBrianna, come on,\u201d he said guiding his wife away from the table. \u201cWhat? I'm not a child. I can handle her.\u201d \u201cI'm sure you can.\u201d He informed the waiter they would be taking their bottle of sparkling cider home. \u201cBut you're letting your emotions get away with you. Your brother is a grown man and can handle himself.\u201d Brianna blew a raspberry at him. \u201cOh yes, quite mature. Let's go home.\u201d He guided her towards the entrance.": "E.",
  "I felt sorry for her, baby, guilty and responsible. That's all it was. Once she started talking about you, I could have thrown her off the deck with no remorse. I know there are no words that can take away what you saw, just please say you understand. Liz is nothing to me, Evan, but you...you're everything.": "Lilly",
  "We'll worry about cock holding later.": "Lilly",
  "You take pleasure in my disregard for her because in your fantasies, you're different - superior and singular in my eyes. You are, Evan, all of those things, and deep down, you want what I'm offering. You want to be dominated, guided, cherished.": "Lilly",
  "Little girl,\" Cain begins, moving in close and speaking deliberately. \"I know exactly what I want, but as long as you insist on continuing this charade, I will not claim you as mine again until you beg to hear those words from me.\" I stare at him, stunned at how the same cocksure attitude that floods my mind with contempt floods my body with excitement as he leans back, a satisfied smirk on his face. \"I don't beg,\" I hiss.\"Not yet,\" is all he says.": "Lilly",
  "A loud clang of what sounded like a tray hitting the marble kitchen floor made Bree jump and Gianni go wide eyed with apparent terror. He covered his ears and shook his head. \u201cBang! Bang! Bang!\u201d He fell over and covered his head. Bree rushed over to him as he began shrieking fearfully. \u201cMaaammaaaaaa!\u201d \u201cIs okay, Gianni. Just a ting falled down,\u201d Will said patting Gianni\u2019s back but Bree noticed her little boy\u2019s hand was shaking. \u201cIt\u2019s okay, sweetie. Mommy\u2019s here. That\u2019s okay,\u201d she crouched down and gathered Gianni into her arms. \u201cBang! Mama. It bang!\u201d he wailed into her shoulder, trembling in her arms. \u201cIt was just a loud noise. Cook just dropped something, probably a whole big plate of yucky beets. Isn\u2019t that funny?\u201d she said, forcing a laugh. Jesus Christ, how much more violence would her children be forced to endure? Again, Bree felt selfish for bringing her innocent babies into the Dardano world. Gianni looked up at her, picking up on her tone he gave a small watery smile. \u201cUcky ee \u201cYucky yucky beets,\u201d Bree repeated bouncing him lightly as her heart returned to its normal rhythm in her chest. Gianni giggled and shuddered against her as the last remnants of his fear dissipated. Bree looked over at Will. \u201cYou okay, sweetie?\u201d Will blinked and looked over at her, wide eyed and his lower lip quivered, but he set his chin like she knew he\u2019d watched Alessandro do and nodded. \u201cI bwave. I nod scared.\u201d Bree smiled at him and kissed his cheek as she ran her fingers through his hair. \u201cWow. That is pretty brave. I know I wasscared when I first heard the noise.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Will asked hesitantly. \u201cDefinitely,\u201d Bree nodded. Gianni echoed the gesture. \u201cWell, dat\u2019s diffen. You\u2019s a girl.\u201d \u201cOh, is that so?\u201d Bree asked setting Gianni on the blanket next to her. \u201cSo you think \u2019cause mommy\u2019s a girl she\u2019s a fraidy cat. Huh? Huh?\u201d she asked poking him. Will curled in on himself and giggled as he tried to avoid her fingers.": "E.",
  "Yeah, well, he\u2019s having a hard time dealing, you know?\u201d Bree asked uneasily. \u201cThat\u2019s understandable. How are you coping?\u201d he asked, reaching out and touching her arm. Gianni shifted in her arms and looked down at Colin\u2019s hand. \u201cIt\u2019s taking some getting used to. Let\u2019s just say it\u2019s a bit of a relief to take a break for a little while. I\u2019m more worried about the kids though and this is affecting them so I\u2019m hoping to get in to see Dr. Graham. She was a big help to Will a while back.\u201d \u201cOh, yeah. I hear great things about her. You know she doesn\u2019t just work with kids, right?\u201d Bree narrowed her eyes but smiled in amusement. \u201cIs that a hint?\u201d \u201cNot a very subtle one, I know. Hey Gianni, how you doing, huh? Wow, you\u2019re sure getting big,\u201d Colin remarked. \u201cHe sure is. He\u2019s almost standing all by himself now, aren\u2019t you, Gianni? You wanna show Colin?\u201d Bree asked. \u201cNooo,\u201d Gianni insisted, burying his face in Bree\u2019s neck. \u201cOh, speaking of Mr. Cranky Pants, huh? He didn\u2019t get a lot of sleep last night.\u201d Gianni lifted his head and then looked down, and it was then that Bree noticed Colin still had his hand on her arm. \u201cDat,\u201d Gianni said. Bree cleared her throat and took a step back, not wanting to make the movement seem like she was uncomfortable with Colin touching her.": "E.",
  "Colin. Just the name made Alessandro\u2019s gut burn. He knew the man wanted his wife, even if Brianna was too blind to see it. The moron had been cuckolded by the paragon of supposed virtue, his wife Carrie and now he had finally opened his eyes and seen what Alessandro had known all along. Brianna put every other woman in New York to shame. No woman could come near her beauty, her passion, her fire. Colin had tossed her aside for the angelic Carrie and now he was changing his mind. Oh no you don\u2019t, you miserable fucker. \u201cHer friend indeed,\u201d Bernardo drawled, his Italian accent thick with unmistakable implication. \u201cDat\u2019s da truth. He no make her cry all da time.\u201d That was directed at Alessandro, with small dark accusatory eyes. \u201cHe nice.\u201d Alessandro couldn\u2019t look at those eyes without feeling a sickening pang of guilt. She\u2019s mine! He wanted to scream. Mine! Mine! Mine! \u201cOh yes. Very nice. He was very nice when he held her at the cemetery and very nice when he was dancing with her at Adresca.\u201d That made Alessandro\u2019s head lift in surprise. \u201cOh yes, my boy. She\u2019s been there, cleaning up the rubble and word is that she\u2019s working on re-opening it. Her friend Colin has been quite helpful in that endeavour.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019 like how you say dat,\u201d Will said scowling. \u201cReally young William, I only speak the truth,\u201d Bernardo taunted. Alessandro\u2019s mind was racing. NO! Not Colin. He could not let that imbecile take Brianna away from him. He\u2019d have to be eliminated somehow. Alessandro began to plot all the different ways he could ensure that Colin Neally stayed away from his wife, permanently. They all involved grisly, violent methods. He could not be allowed to win Brianna.": "E.",
  "He grinned at her. \u201cWell, then I have a bit of a confession to make. Colin said some things to me and the sound of his voice irritated me so I had one of those clowns with the big red noses in the paediatric wing turn him into a balloon animal. A giraffe I\u2019m afraid. Sad fate it was,\u201d Alessandro joked with no sign of remorse at all.": "E.",
  "Not\u2026\u201d Bree struggled for the right words. \u201cAll my life, I\u2019ve just wanted someone to put me first. I thought Alessandro was that man. But even after everything Bernardo has done, I mean, Arturo wouldn\u2019t have ever shot Alessandro if Bernardo hadn\u2019t raised him to be a monster, even knowing that, Alessandro refuses to cut his ties with his father. So\u2026yeah, I guess I do blame Alessandro for getting shot. God, that sounds so horrible.\u201d Bree covered her face with her hands again.": "E.",
  "The pain of it was crippling him. He couldn\u2019t breathe. Be a man! Be a Dardano. Alessandro felt the protective wall shoot up around his heart in one quick instant. Dardanos weren\u2019t weak and stupid like he had been. Dardanos didn\u2019t let their emotions blind them. Love was for fools. Love made men stupid. But oh, she would never make him stupid again. Oh, how Alessandro would make his darling wife pay.": "E.",
  "Tease me like that again, and I'll put you over my knee,\" Cain threatens, and my poor impulse control kicks into overdrive.\"I'm not teasing.": "Lilly",
  "You are not a crowd. You are not a label. As an individual you have a unique place in my heart and mind.": "Salil",
  "You're beautiful, my little wolf. Every single part of you, especially your soul. I can feel it connected to mine.": "Elena",
  "I\u2019m insatiable? I am?\u201d Alessandro asked cocking an eyebrow as he ran his warm hands along the satin material covering her body. \u201cAlessandro. You\u2019re alive. I can touch you, look into your eyes and hear your arrogant English voice. We\u2019re gonna spend the rest of our lives together, that\u2019s plenty romantic for me.\u201d Bree pressed her mouth against him. He tasted of coffee and peppermint. He nibbled slightly on her lower lip before pulling away. \u201cDarling, that sounds lovely, but my wedding night fantasy was more along the lines of fucking you into the mattress.\u201d Bree smacked his shoulder. \u201cPatience, Dardano. Tonight we take things slow, the mattress fucking will come in time. Now, get on your back and let me put my hands on you and assure myself that you\u2019re real.\u201d Alessandro sighed but did as she ordered. \u201cNow if you feel anything-\u201d \u201cI certainly hope so or we have a very big problem,\u201d Alessandro joked. She smacked his chest. \u201cIf you feel any pain you let me know and we\u2019ll stop.\u201d \u201cSays the woman who\u2019s smacked me twice in the past five minutes,\u201d Alessandro said, but his eyes were shining with amusement.": "E.",
  "What did you do to make him smile?\u201d \u201cAh\u2026\u201d Alessandro bit back a grin and cleared his throat. \u201cI might\u2019ve sung a song.\u201d \u201cReally? What song?\u201d \u201cAs his mother, I don\u2019t think I should repeat it for you,\u201d Alessandro said, his cheeks and the tips of his ears pink. \u201cOh come on, Alessandro. The windows didn\u2019t break so you couldn\u2019t have done that bad a job.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not my ability that I\u2019m referring to,\u201d Alessandro replied. Bree narrowed her eyes. \u201cJust what were you singing to my son? And so help me if you say anything by Sir Mix-a-lot I\u2019ll castrate you,\u201d \u201cNot quite,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cAll right. But, remember you asked for it. Your cousin Max, taught it to me.\u201d Bree crossed her arms over her breasts and waited.": "E.",
  "That girl didn\u2019t have a moment\u2019s peace from the day Adriano Dardano set foot in Galway and started chasing her.\u201d Sister Brannigan said, as she led them around the convent garden. \u201cNice of Francesca to stay still for him to catch her then wasn\u2019t it?\u201d Alessandro remarked dryly. \u201cMmph,\u201d the nun responded. \u201cMy grandfather loved Francesca,\u201d Alessandro insisted. \u201cFar be it from me to speak ill of the dead. But let\u2019s call a spade a spade, hmm? Your grandfather was a charmer. Now perhaps he didn\u2019t realize just how na\u00efve our Francesca was and how besotted with him she was.\u201d \u201cMmm, very generous of you,\u201d Alessandro grumbled. \u201cI will say that on the times he brought some food he had made with Francesca up to the convent, it was clear he had a wonderful talent in the kitchen. Now mind ye, the Italian food was a bit rich for my taste but still, rather good.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sure my grandfather\u2019s resting easier in his grave now that the holy sister has complimented his cooking,\u201d Alessandro whispered in Bree\u2019s ear making, her laugh out loud and Sister Brannigan turn to her in question.": "E.",
  "Bree stared at the items and the simple silver chain around her finger. Why? The question stayed with her as she paced around the inn, waiting for Alessandro and the boys. Why wouldn\u2019t she keep Adriano\u2019s locket around her neck. Who was in plot 777 in London and why was it important? Whose address was this? Bree wondered, staring at the slip of paper. Her curiosity was most definitely peaked.": "E.",
  "What do you think you\u2019re doing?\u201d She snapped, watching Alessandro pull back the covers and pull his legs in under the blankets. \u201cI\u2019m going to sleep, darling. I don\u2019t think any amorous advances would be welcome tonight seeing as you\u2019re in a bit of a snit, so \u2019night, darling.\u201d \u201cGet out of this bed, right now or so help me, I will do something to you that will severely compromise your ability to father any more children.\u201d \u201cAh, so you admit that there will be more children for us?\u201d He gave her a small smile. Bree came up on her elbows and narrowed her eyes. \u201cAlessandro, go back to your coffee table.\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cWhat do you mean, no? I\u2019m furious with you. I don\u2019t want to sleep with you, now get out,\u201d \u201cLet me put it another way, Sunshine,\u201d he reached over and tapped her nose playfully. \u201cNot bloody hardly. I am paying for this room and that includes this bed.\u201d \u201cFine. Then I\u2019ll go somewhere else,\u201d Bree said, kicking the blanket off of her. Alessandro reached out a long leg and hooked it around one of hers, trapping her. \u201cIf you don\u2019t want me to tie you to this bed, you\u2019ll stay where you are. And you know how much I\u2019d enjoy that.": "E.",
  "Well, no, Sister Brannigan was the one putting her name on the checks to the cemetery. Someone else was making the deposits into her personal account.\u201d \u201cBut now that she\u2019s gone?\u201d \u201cI suppose the Neapolitan benefactor will have to find someone else if he wants to remain anonymous.\u201d Bree snorted, \u201cFor a second I thought maybe it might be Bernardo.\u201d \u201cWell, why not? I mean, a little bank fraud isn\u2019t likely to keep my father up at night,\u201d Alessandro said. \u201cBut he\u2019s in New York,\u201d Bree reminded him. \u201cGeography, darling?\u201d Alessandro asked amused. \u201cYou say that with such pride it scares me,\u201d Bree said rolling her eyes. \u201cI love you too,\u201d Alessandro smiled. \u201cBut no. If he was, why let us go off on this whole journey?\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s Bernardo. If there\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned about your father it\u2019s that the rules of logic don\u2019t apply to him. Or any other kind of rules,\u201d Bree added, \u201cMaybe this is all some kind of big elaborate plan and we\u2019re gonna go home and find out he\u2019s been keeping Francesca and Adriano frozen in his basement in one of those sci-fi freezers that they say you can buy and use to come back to life in a hundred years.\u201d Alessandro shook his head at her, not impressed with her sense of humour.": "E.",
  "How bad will it hurt?\" I ask suddenly as Cain pulls the car onto the road to head back to my house. \"How bad will what hurt?\" \"The spankings, the torture, all the ways you want to punish me.\" \"I'm not a sadist, Evan. I don't get off on hurting women.\"\"So it won't hurt?\"\"Oh, it will, but you'll love the way it hurts,\" he says, and as his words fall upon my ears in a harmony of exhilaration and foreboding, I think I'm beginning to understand.": "Lilly",
  "Alessandro\u2026we should go down-\u201d \u201cOh I agree.\u201d He smiled, mischievous brown eyes lifting to hers. \u201cDownstairs,\u201d she corrected. \u201cI like my meaning better,\u201d and with that he went down on his knees. \u201cNo!\u201d Bree hissed even as her body was screaming YES! \u201cStop arguing with me, darling.": "E.",
  "Good morning, Sunshine,\u201d Alessandro whispered, dragging the satiny soft object across the tip of her nose. Curiosity made her open her eyes. A rose. A blue rose. \u201cI figured a single rose was safer than a dozen considering the massacre of the last blue roses I gave you,\u201d he smiled sheepishly. \u201cHappy birthday, darling.\u201d Bree blinked and tried to remember what day it was. The fifteenth apparently. She groaned and pulled the blankets back over her head. She was officially thirty today. \u201cCome on now, up we go,\u201d Alessandro pulled the blankets off her face and grabbed her arm, bringing her up. \u201cFor my birthday, I want sleep,\u201d she groaned. Gianni had suffered through a painful night as another tooth was starting to come in and thus his parents had suffered as well. \u201cNope, we\u2019ve got a long day ahead of us. Let\u2019s go.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Bree yawned. \u201cBecause thirty years ago you were born and my life as I knew it would never be the same,\u201d Alessandro explained, nuzzling her neck.": "E.",
  "Alex cornered her right before she was going to make an appointment at the nurse\u2019s station to see him. \u201cBree, I\u2019m going to be referring you to Carlo from now on,\u201d Alex informed her. \u201cI think in light of recent events it would be a conflict of interest for me to continue to be your doctor.\u201d \u201cIs that right?\u201d Bree asked leaning her elbow on the counter and raising an eyebrow. \u201cYes, I wouldn\u2019t feel comfortable about it considering what you did to Carrie.\u201d \u201cAw, that\u2019s nice,\u201d Bree smiled sarcastically, staring up at his smug self-righteous face. \u201cNice to know this place has such moral upstanding doctors.\u201d \u201cYes, so I will be referring you to him from now on,\u201d Alex said, clenching his jaw. \u201cGreat,\u201d Bree said, fighting not to roll her eyes. \u201cHave a good afternoon,\u201d he said curtly and turned to walk away. Don\u2019t do it. Don\u2019t do it, Bree. The evil Bree won though. \u201cYou too, Dr. Home Wrecker.\u201d Alex\u2019s step faltered but he didn\u2019t turn around.": "E.",
  "Alessandro watched as Luke burrowed his nose in the snow and then shook his small body. \u201cWell, that depends on whether you want a male or a female horse.\u201d \u201cMmm. I tink I want a boy horsie. Girl horsies have babies and dat\u2019s too much trouble.\u201d Alessandro bit back a laugh. \u201cMale horse it is then. Let\u2019s see. My favourite horse\u2019s name is Abbott.\u201d \u201cA But?\u201d Will asked laughing. \u201cAbbott,\u201d Alessandro corrected. \u201cChimney,\u201d Will suddenly decided, stopping. Alessandro blinked in confusion. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, did you say \u2018Chimney\u2019?\u201d \u201cIt make sense,\u201d Will assured him. \u201cSanta come down da chimney and he is my pesent, right? So his name be Chimney.\u201d \u201cI agree. Quite logical,\u201d Alessandro nodded. \u201cWell, dat one ting on my list. Der be more.\u201d \u201cDuly noted,\u201d he said.": "E.",
  "She took one look at Alessandro and Bree and placed a hand on her chest. \u201cJesus, Mary and Joseph. Francesca, lass. Is that you?\u201d And then she fainted. \u201cHoly shit!\u201d Bree rushed to the fallen nun's side, ignoring Sister McReady\u2019s scowl of disapproval at her language. \u201cMommy! You killed da penguin lady!\u201d Will cried out in surprise. Bree lightly slapped the old woman\u2019s face and felt a rush of relief when the Mother Superior stirred. The last thing she needed on her conscience was a dead nun. The old woman\u2019s blue eyes opened and anger filled them when her gaze shifted to Alessandro. \u201cYou. You spawn of the devil. Why don\u2019t ye take yerself back where ye came from and leave our poor Francesca alone?\u201d \u201cOh, Mother Superior, yer confused is all. Come now. On yer feet, mum,\u201d Sister McReady said helping the old woman up. \u201cUh, I\u2019m sorry. Sister. Francesca was my great aunt. My name is Bree.\u201d \u201cBree? Jaysus but it\u2019s a ridiculous resemblance it is,\u201d the old woman panted, holding her chest. \u201cAnd you?\u201d She asked turning to Alessandro. \u201cOf course yer not Adriano Dardano, of course but I\u2019ll be a drunken fairy if yer not the spitting image of that demon of temptation, sent to corrupt our poor Francesca. Such a good girl she was,\u201d Sister Brannigan murmured, tears filling her eyes. \u201cSuch a good girl.": "E.",
  "She walked slowly towards him, taking in how he looked so eerily still. \u201cOkay you,\u201d she said, her voice choked. \u201cWe have to have a talk. I know you\u2019re a Dardano, but a wedding reception in the ICU? Not so classy.\u201d She lowered her head, her attempt at levity falling flat under the weight of her heartbreak. She blinked back her tears and cupped his face. \u201cYou listen to me, okay? You are not leaving me. You\u2019re not allowed. You\u2019re going to fight, understand? Alessandro, I will not bury another husband. Do you hear me? I refuse to grieve for you. That is not even an option because you are my life.\u201d She kissed his forehead, the beeping of the heart monitor and the respirators the only sounds in the room. \u201cFunny huh? I spent so much time pushing you away and here I am begging you to stay. Not just for me, but for our boys. Will\u2019s already lost one father, don\u2019t you leave him too. And Gianni\u2026don\u2019t you dare leave him nothing but stories about some man in a picture frame.\u201d Bree took his hand, rubbing his ring finger. \u201cPlease, Alessandro. Fight. I won\u2019t survive without you. I won\u2019t.\u201d She kissed his palm. \u201cWe\u2019ve fought too hard for you to just give up when we\u2019re finally going to be happy. Dammit Alessandro, you owe me! You owe me a life, a happy life together. So don\u2019t you dare die on me. Don\u2019t you leave me to deal with that son of a bitch father of yours by myself.\u201d She covered her mouth with her free hand to stifle her sobs. She leaned down and kissed his still mouth. \u201cI love you\u2026I love you so much\u2026\u201d Her tears fell on his face as she rested her forehead against his.": "E.",
  "She met her father in the living room. \u201cI'm begging you not to kill him.\u201d Her father scowled at her. \u201cThis man is our sworn enemy. He has-\u201d \u201cI know who he is and I know what he's done. I also know he is Gianni's father, and in our hearts, he is Will's father. Will loves him.\u201d \u201cAnd you,\u201d Jack snorted. She glared at her uncle. \u201cThis is not about me.\u201d He was silent, but his disbelief was there in his eyes. Bree turned back to her father. \u201cHe did what he did on the order of his father. Even though I despise Bernardo, we all know that family is everything. It doesn't make it forgivable, but it does make it understandable. I'm begging you for Will's sake. Don't make him lose another father.\u201d \u201cShe could be pregnant with his child,\u201d Beth said softly, coming out of the kitchen. Bree gave a start. They hadn't been trying to conceive but it wasn't outside of the realm of possibility. She grabbed on to the lie. \u201cI am.\u201d Her father's mouth fell open and her uncle swore. She met her sister's gaze in gratitude. \u201cThat's right. I found out in Ireland that, yes, I'm pregnant again.\u201d Beth gave her a tiny nod, acknowledging the lie. \u201cSon of a\u2026\u201d Her father clenched his fists. \u201cDon't leave this baby without a father, Daddy. Please.\u201d John looked from her to her sister. \u201cUntie the son of bitch and toss him on the street.": "E.",
  "Bree stared down at Bernardo\u2019s still form. The monitor was the only sound in the room apart from his deep breathing. Alessandro had gone down to the cafeteria with Will and Gianni to grab something to eat before they left for home. Bree lied and told him that she wanted to check in with Tina and her mother Roxanna for a few minutes before they left. Even unconscious, the son of a bitch was formidable and Bree felt nervous around him. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you do everyone a favour and just die already?\u201d Bree said. No response. Bree sneered and shook her head, turning to leave. \u201cYou could always smother me with a pillow,\u201d a groggy voice said behind her, making her heart nearly stop. Bree whirled around wide-eyed and met Bernardo\u2019s dark gaze. She forced herself to shrug and crossed her arms. \u201cDo you think Alessandro would forgive you for murdering his father?\u201d Bernardo asked. They both knew the answer to that.": "E.",
  "Bree arched, trying to stretch out her muscles and Alessandro gave her a dirty look as if she was displaying herself to him on purpose. Well, maybe she was a little. Even though he blocked her from the hotel attendant\u2019s gaze with his body in the doorway, Bree was sure to cover herself with the blanket. Alessandro turned around, pulling in the tray with him and his eyes flared hungrily as he looked down at her. \u201cYou look like a beautiful debauched angel,\u201d he said, his voice rough with desire. \u201cAnd you\u2019re what, the demon that\u2019s corrupted me?\u201d Bree asked raising an eyebrow and letting the blanket fall down to her waist, baring her to him. \u201cIt\u2019s my life\u2019s work, you know?\u201d Alessandro grinned, going down on to his knees and leaning over her. Bree placed a hand on his chest, halting him. \u201cIs that coffee, I smell?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe debauched angel is kind of hungry.\u201d She bit her lip and smiled up at his frustrated face.": "E.",
  "Bree nodded eagerly, anxious to see her friend again. \u201cOooh. I like that idea. Yeah. Let\u2019s stay, Alessandro and then in the morning, we can have wine with our toast! Oh hey, that\u2019s funny, huh. Wine, toast, get it?\u201d Bree giggled. Oh wow. Her head was feeling really, really fuzzy. \u201cOkay, let\u2019s go to bed,\u201d Alessandro said rising from the couch after he and Kevin finished discussing the plans for the vineyard in the coming year as well as the progress it had made thus far. Bree gasped. \u201cAlessandro! We can\u2019t have sex in someone else\u2019s house!\u201d Alessandro blushed and placed a hand on her back, leading her towards the stairs after wishing Hadley a good night. \u201cIt\u2019s my house, darling,\u201d he reminded her. \u201cOh well, that\u2019s okay then, but you can\u2019t be loud though cause that would still be rude,\u201d Bree said, reaching down and squeezing Alessandro\u2019s ass. Gosh, her hubby had a really nice tight ass. \u201cHere we are,\u201d he said, leading her into one of the mansion\u2019s many bedrooms. \u201cAlessandro, I hass\u2026have\u2026a little confestion to make,\u201d Bree said leaning her head on his shoulder. \u201cYou do?\u201d he asked placing her on the bed and bending down to remove her shoes. Bree lay back and stared up at the spinning ceiling. \u201cMmhm. I think\u2026I\u2019m ina...Little drunk bit.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d Alessandro asked with feigned surprise.": "E.",
  "I'll wait for you as long as it takes, Evan,\" he says.\"I'll test your patience,\" I warn, my smile beginning to show itself again.\"You already do.": "Lilly",
  "You're the mold.": "Lilly",
  "So what is it, Evan? What is it that is making your mouth say 'no' when every other part of you is screaming 'yes'?\" \"Screaming?\"\"Screaming.": "Lilly",
  "I have every right to go out tonight and fuck anyone I like, little girl. What I'm telling you is that I don't want to fuck anyone else.": "Lilly",
  "Alessandro burst out laughing and Bree wrapped her arms around his neck. \u201cDon\u2019t think about the past anymore. Let\u2019s move forward and let\u2019s be happy.\u201d Alessandro cocked an eyebrow. \u201cIs that an order, young lady?\u201d \u201cYes, Sir. From this second on, you\u2019re not allowed to think about how much we hurt each other and how stupid you were-\u201c \u201cHow stupid I-\u201c \u201cAh!\u201d Bree pressed her fingers against his lips. \u201cHow stupid we both were.\u201d \u201cAnd what would the punishment be for disobeying such an order?\u201d Alessandro asked, his fingers trailing down her back. \u201cOh it would be very bad,\u201d Bree assured him playfully. \u201cVery?\u201d Alessandro asked, his eyes lit with amusement. \u201cOh yes. Brutal. Vicious even.\u201d \u201cOh that does sound terrible,\u201d Alessandro agreed. \u201cThere might even be whips,\u201d Bree warned. \u201cOh dear,\u201d Alessandro smiled.": "E.",
  "How could she even think what she\u2019s thinking? Alessandro wondered silently as he watched Brianna glare pure murder at the misguided Gertie smiling up at him. Alessandro cocked an amused eyebrow and gave her a polite smile when he noticed the look on Brianna\u2019s face. Didn\u2019t she know that if it weren\u2019t for all these people, Alessandro would drag her onto the bar and fuck her madly? As it was, his body had maintained its state of semi arousal for most of the morning and into this late afternoon. He was half-tempted to drag her into the nearest closet. And she was jealous. Alessandro wanted to laugh at the ridiculous notion. While he could still appreciate the beauty of young Gertie on an aesthetic level, Brianna really had ruined him for other women. If anything, the fact that she had carried his son in her body, given birth to his child, made his primal need and want of her all that more intense. Alessandro considered himself sophisticated and well-schooled in the ways of women and how to seduce them. With Brianna, he just wanted. Her strength, her heart, her passion, her courage, all coupled with a body that kept him hard as a rock for more time than was surely healthy, created the only woman he would ever love. Ever.": "E.",
  "Mmm,\u201d Bree licked the ice cream scoop and tossed it into the sink. \u201cLet\u2019s just say that for the sake of the baby, Alessandro and I have reached a sort of\u2026an...agreement, I guess.\u201d \u201cDoes that mean I can\u2019t punch him anymore? \u2018Cause that was fun.\u201d \u201cYes. It does. Sorry.\u201d \u201cSo are you two\u2026\u201d \u201cNo. Hell no. Not after him using Rebecca Malford as a scratching post,\u201d Bree grumbled, her stomach clenching tight at that little reminder. \u201cHe\u2019s what? Alessandro and that...viper?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right.\u201d Bree clenched her teeth. \u201cRebecca and Alessandro? Oh my God. Mental bleach! I need mental bleach!\u201d Meggie rubbed her temples. \u201cYeah, keep doing that for another week and you might be where I am right about now.\u201d \u201cOh, he\u2019s a smooth one, that\u2019s for sure,\u201d Meggie said with a sudden smile. \u201cWhat\u2019s with that look?\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re so jealous,\u201d Bree snorted, turning away from her and taking a seat opposite of Will. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d \u201cAnd so true.": "E.",
  "You will never have to worry about safety. Being a Dardano will buy you all the security you\u2019ll ever need.\u201d Bree shook her head and threw her hands up. \u201cBeing a Dardano will put the bulls eye on my back, you asshole,\u201d \u201cReally, darling, once you become Mrs. Dardano, we\u2019re going to have to work on cleaning up that saucy mouth of yours. At least in public,\u201d Alessandro purred, tapping her nose. Bree saw red. But she smiled at him. She took the plate from him and set it down on the vanity table. Then she took the vitamin shake, pulled out the waistband of his pants and poured it down inside.": "E.",
  "His eyes widened. \u201cPain? Darling, you haven\u2019t yet experienced the pain I can inflict when I\u2019ve been played for a fool. I\u2019m in awe at your gall to try and fool me.\u201d Bree went still as panic froze her. Oh, God. No. \u201cAh, the light bulb finally goes off,\u201d he purred against her face; his voice low and cold. Even knowing who he was, and the family he came from, Bree could say that deep inside, she\u2019d never felt any real fear of him. She did now. He knew. The look on his face told her he knew that she had lied about him being her baby\u2019s father. Frantically, she grasped for any foothold she could find. \u201cI don\u2019t know what you\u2019re talking-\u201c \u201cDON\u2019T!\u201d he snapped, grabbing the sides of her face.": "E.",
  "Alessandro shrugged and pushed the blade in, dragging it down the man\u2019s skin, making him cry out. He struck him again with his fist, blood spurting onto Alessandro as well. \u201cDid Arturo tell you that the mother of my child was in that limo? She\u2019s carrying my baby inside of her, and that her son was in the limo too? I\u2019m sure he did. I\u2019m sure he left explicit instructions as to who exactly you were supposed to dispose of, didn\u2019t he?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019ll kill me. I swear, he\u2019ll kill me,\u201d the man cried, tears mixing in with his blood. \u201cNext, I\u2019ll take an eye, you snivelling little shit!\u201d Alessandro growled, raising his bloody blade to the man\u2019s left eyeball. The unmistakable scent of urine filled the air. Alessandro stepped back in disgust and turned to Jason and his other man, Marty, two of the best Dardano soldiers, loyal and efficient. They took his cue and slipped on their brass knuckles. \u201cJust say the words, ol\u2019 boy, and we\u2019ll stop this,\u201d \u201cFuck you,\u201d the man shouted. Alessandro smirked. \u201cSuch defiance for a man who just pissed himself.\u201d He crossed his arms as Marty and Jason went to work. It only took a minute. \u201cAll right. Okay! Stop! Stop! Fine, I\u2019ll talk!": "E.",
  "Alessandro gathered her into his arms and flipped her over so that she was on top of him, her blonde hair falling over him like a gold curtain. The strands tickled his face as she righted herself over him. She caught her lower lip between her teeth as he pushed up inside of her, and Alessandro reached up, bringing her mouth down, wanting to taste that swollen lip. Her breath wafted over his face, and he grabbed her hips, pulling her down as he pushed up deeper, wanting to fill her to her very soul.": "E.",
  "Father, perhaps you\u2019ve forgotten the fact that when my child was conceived, neither Bree nor I knew who the other person was.\u201d \u201cAi, ai, ai\u2026 Alessandro, open your mind, please! It was fate, my boy.\u201d \u201cOh, good God, here we go again,\u201d Arturo threw his hands up. \u201cDon\u2019t you have a puppy to go kick?\u201d Alessandro asked, his brother\u2019s voice grating on his already stretched nerves.": "E.",
  "Bree turned to him and gave him an uneasy nod. She had no idea if they were gonna make things better or worse, but she had to know for herself what Francesca had gone through, where she lived and why she made the decisions she had. If she could find out more about the ill-fated romance between Francesca and Adriano, maybe she and Alessandro could avoid a similar, miserable ending.": "E.",
  "I like that,\u201d Bree admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s like\u2026it\u2019s never too late to change.\u201d Her eyes met his, and she hoped he understood that she meant it for him as well as for herself. She wanted Alessandro to give in to the good she knew was in him and leave the Dardano family behind. \u201cI forgot about that. I feel rather ashamed of it now. Because of the things I\u2019ve done. Then I was looking at this tiny creature here, and you\u2019re going to think I\u2019m mad but\u2026every time I look at him, he looks different to me. He\u2019s the same boy, but something in him is always changing. It\u2019s not a physical thing that I can explain to you, but it\u2019s\u2026like\u2026I don\u2019t know,\u201d Alessandro said shrugging and lowering his head. He sat on the bed next to her and stared at the incubator. The baby\u2019s eyes were open, staring back, blinking slowly, sleepily. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing him become a person. Like all the parts of him are coming together and making this tiny person\u2019s soul. He was one person in here,\u201d Bree pointed to her stomach. \u201cAnd now he\u2019s changing on the outside so he can be a part of the world.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s it,\u201d Alessandro nodded. \u201cHe\u2019s a part of the world now. My world, in a completely different way than when he was inside of you. It\u2019s like having two sons and watching them become one as a slow minute by minute process. He\u2019s never going to stop changing. What he thinks and feels now is not going to be what he thinks and feels tomorrow or fifty years from now.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the same for you,\u201d Bree said, closing her fingers over his on the bed. \u201cI don\u2019t want to forget that again, Brianna. I don\u2019t ever want to forget that I can change.\u201d He looked so earnest that Bree couldn\u2019t help bringing his hand to her lips. \u201cThen don\u2019t.": "E.",
  "Bree shot to her feet and glared at him. \u201cLook all you want, Brianna. That was the deal, remember? Until Arturo is found, I\u2019m not leaving you alone.\u201d Alessandro stared down at her with immovable stubbornness. \u201cHow am I gonna explain you to my grandfather? And what if the rest of my family is there?\u201d \u201cHello O\u2019Reiley family, you remember Alessandro, the father of my child, the man that I love, the light of my life, ma raison d'\u00eatre\u2026\u201d \u201cAre you done?\u201d Bree asked cocking an eyebrow. \u201cDepends, are you quite ready to go? Look, you can explain that I\u2019m there for answers too. My father\u2019s involvement in this vendetta directly influences my own future and that of my child.": "E.",
  "Bree rubbed her belly. Figured; Alessandro wasn\u2019t one to live in quiet but strained tension. She stared up at the fabric of the canopy and then squeezed her eyes shut. \u201cAlessandro, considering that the outside world has the sterile hospital rooms, not to mention the epidurals, yeah. For goodness sake, Alessandro. You know we can\u2019t stay here forever. I\u2019m entering my eighth month here.\u201d \u201cI must say, I\u2019m surprised you\u2019re so anxious to leave.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d Bree asked, turning to look at his strong profile. \u201cYou know why, Brianna. As soon as we walk out that door, you and I are over.\u201d Bree felt a guilty tightening in her chest. \u201cPerhaps that\u2019s what you want, though.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not fair,\u201d Bree whispered even as she feared he was right. No. He\u2019s wrong. I love him. She wasn\u2019t going to let anyone shake what she and Alessandro had built here. She\u2019d let her family know that she wanted Alessandro in her life and that she wanted to be a family with him. \u201cThanks for your confidence in me, though. Really.": "E.",
  "Mommy, how come Dona Duck don have no pants?\u201d Will sat on the couch eating cookies. Bree looked up. Then she glanced at the Donald Duck cartoon on the TV. \u201cHe have top but he no have bottoms,\u201d \u201cGood point,\u201d she said. And yet the duck always wore a towel after he showered. \u201cDat\u2019s odd,\u201d Will remarked. He leaned over his plate and began to split his cookies into two piles. \u201cAnd where his pee pee go? He a boy right, mommy? But he don\u2019 have no pee pee. How he go to bafroom?": "E.",
  "I understand Mrs. Donovan is a free woman, Mr. Dardano. It\u2019s all for a good cause after all, isn\u2019t it?\u201d \u201cFifty thousand dollars,\u201d Alessandro countered, deadly calm though inside he was fairly trembling with rage. \u201cOne hundred thousand dollars,\u201d Hadley countered, getting to his feet, appearing to enjoy the spectacle of all eyes being on the two of them now. Alessandro stood, his fists clenched tight at his sides. \u201cTwo hundred and fifty thousand dollars,\u201d Bree was staring at them both, her mouth open. Kevin smiled at him. \u201cThree hundred thousand dollars,\u201d \u201cOne million dollars,\u201d Alessandro shot back, his eyes clouding with rage. So help him, if the son of a bitch opened his mouth, Alessandro was gonna shove his fist down his throat. The entire ballroom was dead silent. Holding its breath. \u201cUh\u2026Going once?\u201d Alex announced. Kevin met Alessandro\u2019s gaze, smirking. \u201cGoing twice?\u201d Kevin lifted his hands in surrender. \u201cThe best man won. I hope you get more than a dance, my friend,\u201d \u201cSold,\u201d Alex announced, slamming the little gavel down. Alessandro felt a rush of both victory and relief as he stared at Brianna. He walked up to her and extended his hand. \u201cDarling?": "E.",
  "Okay, someone\u2019s been smoking the wacky tobacky. And keep your hands to yourself!\u201d She smacked at his roving fingers, fighting the shivers following his touch. \"I agreed to let you accompany me because, well...maybe you're right. We should try and put the animosity between our families-stop that!\" She gripped his fingers and tried to twist them, but he easily pulled out of her grip. Alessandro laughed. \u201cDarling, I haven\u2019t laughed in ages like I do when I\u2019m with you. I propose a clean slate, eh?\u201d He sighed and sat back against the seat. \u201cBrianna. I\u2019m not going to give up until you are mine. You could make this so much easier if you just accept the inevitable.\u201d He lifted his hand to cup the side of her face. \u201cWe belong to each other, and you know it.": "E.",
  "He took a step back and stared down at her, and she watched the cold mask slowly slip back over his face. \u201cSo\u2026that\u2019s it? You just decide I\u2019m not good enough to be with and-\u201c \u201cOh, Alessandro no! You know that\u2019s not-\u201c \u201cWell, let me tell you something, if you think you\u2019re going to keep me away from my baby-\u201c \u201cNo,\u201d Bree promised. \u201cYou can see him anytime you want\u2026at my apartment.\u201d He laughed bitterly and sniffled. \u201cYou know something ironic, Brianna? You\u2019re probably the only woman who could have turned me into that man that you deem worthy of your love,\u201d Alessandro walked towards the door and opened it. \u201cDaddy?\u201d a small voice called out. Both Alessandro and Bree turned to Will wearing identically stunned expressions. \u201cCan you stay wif me \u2018till I go sleep \u2018gain?\u201d Alessandro choked on a sob and left the room, slamming the door behind him.": "E.",
  "His scowl deepened. \u201cIf he wanted to hurt Will, he could have easily come here when I was at work, but no, he respected your feelings, and he allowed us to come together in our own time.\u201d \u201cAs opposed to what? Dragging me up by my hair to the altar?\u201d Bree asked. \u201cWell that was his suggestion. I suggested a more diplomatic approach.": "E.",
  "Last night, Bree had been taken. Thoroughly, utterly taken. Gently or roughly, it didn\u2019t matter. This man had reached into the darkest part of her mind, had brought out and laid bare the desires she admitted to no one but herself in her most secret, quiet moments. Her hunger had been allowed to run free. There\u2019d been no guilt, no remorse. Nothing was \u2018wrong\u2019. And God, the feeling of freedom was damned addictive. What did that say about her? How could she love Michael, yet give a part of her she\u2019d never felt comfortable sharing with Michael to this stranger.": "E.",
  "He lowered his head and shook it from side to side, giving her a rueful smile. \u201cI find it so ironic that someone I think of as sometimes so brave to the point of stupidity could be so terrified of her own happiness,\u201d Bree felt the shot hit home, and she couldn\u2019t look at him. She ran her finger along the marble topped of the island. \u201cThat\u2019s ridiculous. Who in their right mind is afraid of being happy?\u201d \u201cSomeone who has lost too much,\u201d he moved slowly towards her in gentle careful strides as if he was afraid of startling her. Fair enough, she did tend to attack him when he tried to corner her, but for some reason, Bree just couldn\u2019t tonight. The much too relaxing bubble bath must be making her sluggish. \u201cSomeone who is so used to being told she caused too much pain to others to ever be worthy of happiness herself,\u201d Bree closed her eyes. \u201cShut up. Please, Alessandro.": "E.",
  "She realized he wasn\u2019t listening to music and gave him a curious look of amusement as she picked up the cover to an audio book. \u2018What To Expect When You\u2019re Expecting.\u2019 God forgive me, I love this man. \u201cThought I should be informed, you know?\u201d Alessandro explained sheepishly. Bree tried to tear her gaze away from his gleaming chest. \u201cPlus all the lactating and dilating and placenta talk does wonders to crush any man\u2019s libido.": "E.",
  "Bree crossed her arms over her protruding belly. \u201cI\u2019m fine. No one has shot at me in the last twenty four hours, and my family is talking to me again. Things are looking up.\u201d He grimaced at the mention of her family. \u201cHow fortunate for you.\u201d Bree narrowed her eyes at him, picking up on the derogatory tone. \u201cWell, you should know all about the importance of family. You\u2019d do anything for yours, right? Bernardo says jump, you ask \u2018how high?\u2019 \u201c Alessandro felt a sick twist of guilt in his chest, \u201cWell, congratulations, Brianna. You\u2019ve worked very hard for the title of O\u2019Reiley doormat. I hope it\u2019s all you\u2019ve ever wanted. I hope you\u2019re happy.\u201d \u201cBlissfully,\u201d Bree shot back and turned on her heel, leaving him there filled with anger and regret.": "E.",
  "Lies. All lies. Bree was shaking so hard she bit her tongue, but she didn\u2019t even feel the blood in her mouth. Kill her husband and seduce the widow. She thought she\u2019d never felt as angry as when Michael died, but this, oh God, her entire body was a live wire of rage. She was so furious, she was almost numb. So numb that she didn\u2019t even feel herself reaching for the gun she had pulled out of the glove compartment and pocketed. So numb that she didn\u2019t feel herself lift the gun and aim. So numb that she saw nothing, but his eyes, staring back at her in wide eyed surprise and confusion. She felt so numb she didn\u2019t even feel herself pull the trigger.": "E.",
  "We have nothing!\u201d Bree reached out and slapped him with all her might. He couldn\u2019t know the baby she carried was his. Not ever. Alessandro\u2019s dark eyes flashed angrily at her for a split second, making Bree\u2019s insides tense in anticipation of his rage, but then he smiled at her, his hand going to her thigh. \u201cWell, I was hoping we\u2019d get to know each other a little better before delving into S & M, but I\u2019m game if you are, sunshine.\u201d \u201cI want you to get out,\u201d \u201cAnd I want you naked screaming my name, now that you know it,\u201d Alessandro growled, leaning in so that his breath brushed across her face in a tantalizing caress.": "E.",
  "Alessandro! Will!!\u201d He could hear Brianna\u2019s voice a few seconds before his head came up through to the next floor. Stubborn, bloody woman! he cursed. \u201cOh God, Will!\u201d Bree screamed. \u201cWhat happened?\u201d She rushed towards them, coughing as she grabbed for her son. He shifted his weight to hand him over to her, but the movement sent another bolt of screaming pain from his ankle up to his leg and Alessandro lost his footing, falling back into the basement. Alessandro!\u201d Bree screamed, and then he heard no more.": "E.",
  "That\u2019s our clue. I know where he is now.\u201d Alessandro said, pulling her away from the dead fish. \u201cA dead fish means\u2026what? The docks?\u201d Bree asked. Alessandro gave her a small smile. \u201cYou\u2019re as smart as you are exquisite, my darling.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sorry. A crazy man has my son. Could we get a move on now?\u201d Bree pushed him towards the door. \u201cForgive me, darling. Old habits.\u201d Bree rolled her eyes, but she was grateful for the brief, light moment. It allowed her to regroup and focus, to lift her head from the haze of panic that gripped her thus far.": "E.",
  "My, my, and you accuse the Dardanos of trying to run the world. As you so succinctly put it, you have no desire to be a part of my life, which means you have no say in where I choose to live, sunshine. I, on the other hand, made no such declaration.\u201d \u201cGod, I hate you,\u201d Bree seethed. Alessandro smiled and tapped the end of her nose playfully, resisting the urge to tear her thick coat off of her and take her right against the wall. \u201cYou keep telling yourself that, love. We both know better.": "E.",
  "He held his fingers to my lips. \u201cShh, don\u2019t say it, Tyler. Don\u2019t say the words that will fucking break me. Don\u2019t say the words that will tear my world apart.\u201d Dean sighed and gripped his eyes shut before looking back at me again. \u201cDon\u2019t ask me to give up something that has always been a part of me. It will kill me, Tyler. Please. I can\u2019t live without you.": "Jaimie",
  "Their pull was undeniable, like fireworks on top of flaming bonfires.": "Elena",
  "And your fear boils my fu*king blood Angel, makes me fu*king hungry, do you know that? ~Sade~": "Lucian",
  "He\u2019s lying to me, Bree thought. I don\u2019t know how I know, but I do. And really, wasn\u2019t it better if she didn\u2019t know for sure? Bree moved closer to him and pressed her mouth to his, inhaling the strong, musky scent that seemed to be his alone. Like a mix of spiced wine, dark chocolate and warm leather. Bree eased her tongue in and ran it across his teeth as his fingers moved up her spine to cup her head and bring her closer.": "E.",
  "They stared at each other, and Alessandro seriously considered turning away from his father\u2019s wishes and just taking this woman and running off somewhere with her. He could imagine being happy with her. He felt free, easy. The feeling was heady. But dangerously so. He could never just toss aside his father\u2019s demands that way, even if he wanted to. There would be too much at stake.": "E.",
  "She moved to get up, but the man held her down as her car exploded next. Bree lifted her head and looked back at the wall of fire behind them. \u201cWell. We\u2019re well and truly screwed now.": "E.",
  "Your wonderful mind has a matching body,\u201d I heard Eyuran whispering into my ear through a thick veil of bliss, and found myself laying on my side, my spouse behind me, his hot palm slowly caressing my thigh, up and down. \u201cSo it\u2019s good to give your body the nice treat it is demanding so explicitly.\u201d His finger slid down my spine, making me tremble. \u201cIt wants and needs to be satisfied,\u201d his low voice soaked into my skin.": "Jeno",
  "All these years that I had been waiting for him to return, I had been too anxious and somewhat insecure to develop any plan of action. I had scrupulously avoided giving any thought to it until the time to tackle things head-on arrived, so now I was suffering the consequences of my own indecisiveness. But in all seriousness, what steady plan could there be in matters of the heart?": "Jeno",
  "Personally, I could care less about how people chose their graves. What I do care about is that I don\u2019t want to be dragged along into one, especially by someone who has already lived their life to the fullest.": "Jeno",
  "He let go of my wrists and lifted me up against the wall. \u201cTry fucking getting away from me now. Nice try, Tyler, but I told you that I always win.": "Jaimie",
  "I love you, Tyler. I always have and always will. I can\u2019t let you go because you\u2019re the only person who can breathe oxygen into my lungs, blood to my beating heart, thoughts into my brain. I live only for you, Tyler. Can\u2019t you see that? You were always meant to be mine.": "Jaimie",
  "You can't react to a man's kiss like that and expect him to forget you.": "Chloe",
  "Mmmmmnobaconeggsgottagostore\u2026\u201d She slowly ran her hand down his forearm and gave him a sleepy smile as she sat up. Her eyes remained closed as she rested her hand on his shoulder and before he could realize her intention or even remember his manners and stop her, her mouth was on his in a kiss that was so soft and sweet Alessandro could do nothing but fall into it with her.": "E.",
  "I know. You\u2019re a male escort, and you were on your way to your latest\u2026what are female clients called? Not Johns\u2026Jean\u2019s?\u201d He choked on his cracker, and Bree reached over and patted his back until his coughing fit passed. \u201cAfraid not, darling.\u201d He wheezed. \u201cMale stripper?\u201d He snorted. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I should be flattered or insulted by that.\u201d \u201cSome kind of business tycoon, right?\u201d Bree asked. \u201cA pretty Donald Trump?\u201d \u201cPretty? Oh dear.\u201d Bree raised her hands. \u201cHandsome. Handsome. Better?": "E.",
  "Men need to hunt. She obviously understands this. She\u2019s offering herself as prey. Not easy prey. But willing.": "Willow",
  "I lay my cheek on his solid back. I realize this is the real Jacade. The man who\u2019s strong and fierce, but vulnerable and damaged. Confident and dominating, but generous and kind.": "M.K.",
  "Making love is not something you do to someone\u2015it's something you share. Lovemaking between men and women should be mutually pleasurably. Both women and men should be fully and completely satisfied.": "J.F.",
  "Some men just can\u2019t stomach the necessary steps it takes to make a good girl great.": "Willow",
  "Men need to realize that women take longer to get aroused and satisfied - sometimes 6 -8 times longer. Make the journey pleasurable.": "J.F.",
  "If women were totally satisfied with their sexual and lovemaking experiences, women would welcome the lovemaking experience as much as men.": "J.F.",
  "Each of us has a heart, a soul, and feelings. Each of us desires to be wanted, to be appreciated, and to be loved. The enchantment in life is to discover and spend time with another person who knows that and expresses it. In this context, the liberation of our naked bodies in the act of lovemaking is what gives us ultimate pleasure.": "J.F.",
  "Sam heard someone bellow in the distance, but the sound of freight trains running in his ears dampened the sound, making it impossible for him to locate the source of the cry. When he heard it sound again, closer, the voice sounded familiar somehow. He strained to listen past the thundering racket in his ears, only to be rewarded by another holler from the voice. This time, he recognized the voice as his own.": "J.M.",

It pulsed against her pain until she acknowledged its presence. Her eyes flicked open.

Is it a doctrine formulated by aristocrats and philosophers arguing that there is some unseen driving force predicting the outcomes of every minuscule and life altering moment in one's life?

Is it a declaration by those who refuse to accept that we are alone in this universe, spinning randomly through a matrix of accidental coincidences? Or is it the assumptions made by those who concede that there is a divine plan or pre-ordained path for each human being,regardless of their current station?I think destiny is a bit of a tease....It's syndical taunts and teases mock those naive enough to believe in its black jack dealing of inevitable futures.

None of those jurors were prosecuted. Nor was it policy to prosecute defense witnesses who were demonstrably lying--by providing false alibis, for example--because, as another ADA told me, if they win the case, they don't bother, and if they lose, \"it looks like sour grapes.\" A cop told me about a brawl at court one day, when he saw court officers tackle a man who tried to escape from the Grand Jury. An undercover was testifying about a buy when the juror recognized him as someone he had sold to. Another cop told me about locking up a woman for buying crack, who begged for a Desk Appearance Ticket, because she had to get back to court, for jury duty--she was the forewoman on a Narcotics case, of course.

  "This is not the \"relativism of truth\" presented by journalistic takes on postmodernism. Rather, the ironist's cage is a state of irony by way of powerlessness and inactivity: In a world where terrorism makes cultural relativism harder and harder to defend against its critics, marauding international corporations follow fair-trade practices, increasing right-wing demagoguery and violence can't be answered in kind, and the first black U.S. president turns out to lean right of center, the intelligentsia can see no clear path of action. Irony dominates as a \"mockery of the promise and fitness of things,\" to return to the OED definition of irony.This thinking is appropriate to Wes Anderson, whose central characters are so deeply locked in ironist cages that his films become two-hour documents of them rattling their ironist bars. Without the irony dilemma Roth describes, we would find it hard to explain figures like Max Fischer, Steve Zissou, Royal Tenenbaum, Mr. Fox, and Peter Whitman. I'm not speaking here of specific political beliefs. The characters in question aren't liberals; they may in fact, along with Anderson himself, have no particular political or philosophical interests. But they are certainly involved in a frustrated and digressive kind of irony that suggests a certain political situation. Though intensely self-absorbed and central to their films, Anderson's protagonists are neither heroes nor antiheroes. These characters are not lovable eccentrics. They are not flawed protagonists either, but are driven at least as much by their unsavory characteristics as by any moral sense. They aren't flawed figures who try to do the right thing; they don't necessarily learn from their mistakes; and we aren't asked to like them in spite of their obvious faults. Though they usually aren't interested in making good, they do set themselves some kind of mission--Anderson's films are mostly quest movies in an age that no longer believes in quests, and this gives them both an old-fashioned flavor and an air of disillusionment and futility.": "Arved",

That maybe it's too bad it's impossible, but wake up and smell the coffee already? Most likely, I think, today's irony ends up saying: \"How very banal to ask what I mean.\" Anyone with the heretical gall to ask an ironist what he actually stands for ends up looking like a hysteric or a prig. And herein lies the oppressiveness of institutionalized irony, the too-successful rebel: the ability to interdict the question without attending to its content is tyranny.

  "What one should add here is that self-consciousness is itself unconscious: we are not aware of the point of our self-consciousness. If ever there was a critic of the fetishizing effect of fascinating and dazzling \"leitmotifs\", it is Adorno: in his devastating analysis of Wagner, he tries to demonstrate how Wagnerian leitmotifs serve as fetishized elements of easy recognition and thus constitute a kind of inner-structural commodification of his music. It is then a supreme irony that traces of this same fetishizing procedure can be found in Adorno's own writings. Many of his provocative one-liners do effectively capture a profound insight or at least touch on a crucial point (for example: \"Nothing is more true in pscyhoanalysis than its exaggeration\"); however, more often than his partisans are ready to admit, Adorno gets caught up in his own game, infatuated with his own ability to produce dazzlingly \"effective\" paradoxical aphorisms at the expense of theoretical substance (recall the famous line from Dialectic of Englightment on how Hollywood's ideological maniuplation of social reality realized Kant's idea of the transcendental constitution of reality). In such cases where the dazzling \"effect\" of the unexpected short-circuit (here between Hollywood cinema and Kantian ontology) effectively overshadows the theoretical line of argumentation, the brilliant paradox works precisely in the same manner as the Wagnerian leitmotif: instead of serving as a nodal point in the complex network of structural mediation, it generates idiotic pleasure by focusing attention on itself. This unintended self-reflexivity is something of which Adorno undoubtedly was not aware: his critique of the Wagnerian leitmotif was an allegorical critique of his own writing. Is this not an exemplary case of his unconscious reflexivity of thinking? When criticizing his opponent Wagner, Adorno effectively deploys a critical allegory of his own writing - in Hegelese, the truth of his relation to the Other is a self-relation.": "Slavoj",

It should be remembered, though, that even when Fukuyama advanced it, the idea that history had reached a \u2018terminal beach\u2019 was not merely triumphalist. Fukuyama warned that his radiant city would be haunted, but he thought its specters would be Nietzschean rather than Marxian. Some of Nietzsche\u2019s most prescient pages are those in which he describes the \u2018oversaturation of an age with history\u2019. \u2018It leads an age into a dangerous mood of irony in regard to itself\u2019, he wrote in Untimely Meditations, \u2018and subsequently into the even more dangerous mood of cynicism\u2019, in which \u2018cosmopolitan fingering\u2019, a detached spectatorialism, replaces engagement and involvement.

  "They say \"doubt everything,\" but I disagree. Doubt is useful in small amounts, but too much of it leads to apathy and confusion. No, don't doubt everything. QUESTION everything. That's the real trick. Doubt is just a lack of certainty. If you doubt everything, you'll doubt evolution, science, faith, morality, even reality itself - and you'll end up with nothing, because doubt doesn't give anything back. But questions have answers, you see. If you question everything, you'll find that a lot of what we believe is untrue...but you might also discover that some things ARE true. You might discover what your own beliefs are. And then you'll question them again, and again, eliminating flaws, discovering lies, until you get as close to the truth as you can.Questioning is a lifelong process. That's precisely what makes it so unlike doubt. Questioning engages with reality, interrogating all it sees. Questioning leads to a constant assault on the intellectual status quo, where doubt is far more likely to lead to resigned acceptance. After all, when the possibility of truth is doubtful (excuse the pun), why not simply play along with the most convenient lie?Questioning is progress, but doubt is stagnation.": "Tom",

It follows that there are necessarily some men who know reality and who therefore have certainty; and the great spokesmen of this knowledge and certainty are necessarily the best of men. For if truth were on the side of doubt, the individual who doubted would be superior not only to these spokesmen, who have not doubted, but also to the majority of normal men across the millennia of human existence.

And yet he was not sorry that he had come; the torment which had forced him to leave his own house had lost its sharpness when it lost its uncertainty, now that Odette's other life, of which he had had, at that first moment, a sudden helpless suspicion, was definitely there, almost within his grasp, before his eyes, in the full glare of the lamp-light, caught and kept there, an unwitting prisoner, in that room into which, when he would, he might force his way to surprise and seize it; or rather he would tap upon the shutters, as he had often done when he had come there very late, and by that signal Odette would at least learn that he knew, that he had seen the light and had heard the voices; while he himself, who a moment ago had been picturing her as laughing at him, as sharing with that other the knowledge of how effectively he had been tricked, now it was he that saw them, confident and persistent in their error, tricked and trapped by none other than himself, whom they believed to be a mile away, but who was there, in person, there with a plan, there with the knowledge that he was going, in another minute, to tap upon the shutter.

They are an abundant excess, a luxury of life, and they appear more at the summits of happiness, when you have no crude desires. They are not born in the midst of mundanity. They have no place where there is grief and want. The masses go along without knowing the fog of doubts or the anguish of questions. But for anyone who has encountered them at the right time they are dear visitors, not a hammer.''But there's no coping with them. They bring anguish and indifference to nearly everything.' she added indecisively.'But for how long? Afterward they refresh life,' he said. 'They lead to an abyss from which nothing can be gained, and they force you to look again at life, with even greater love. They summon up your tested powers to struggle with it, as if expressly to let them sleep afterward.''This fog and these specters torment me!' she complained.

When you psychic field force is strong and your vibratory rate is fast, therefore, you will draw only positive situations to you.

  "A woman in her thirties came to see me. As she greeted me, I could sense the pain behind her polite and superficial smile. She started telling me her story, and within one second her smile changed into a grimace of pain. Then, she began to sob uncontrollably. She said she felt lonely and unfulfilled. There was much anger and sadness. As a child she had been abused by a physically violent father. I saw quickly that her pain was not caused by her present life circumstances but by an extraordinarily heavy pain-body. Her pain-body had become the filter through which she viewed her life situation. She was not yet able to see the link between the emotional pain and her thoughts, being completely identified with both. She could not yet see that she was feeding the pain-body with her thoughts. In other words, she lived with the burden of a deeply unhappy self. At some level, however, she must have realized that her pain originated within herself, that she was a burden to herself. She was ready to awaken, and this is why she had come. I directed the focus of her attention to what she was feeling inside her body and asked her to sense the emotion directly, instead of through the filter of her unhappy thoughts, her unhappy story. She said she had come expecting me to show her the way out of her unhappiness, not into it. Reluctantly, however, she did what I asked her to do. Tears were rolling down her face, her whole body was shaking. \u201cAt this moment, this is what you feel.\u201d I said. \u201cThere is nothing you can do about the fact that at this moment this is what you feel. Now, instead of wanting this moment to be different from the way it is, which adds more pain to the pain that is already there, is it possible for you to completely accept that this is what you feel right now?\u201d She was quiet for a moment. Suddenly she looked impatient, as if she was about to get up, and said angrily, \u201cNo, I don't want to accept this.\u201d \u201cWho is speaking?\u201d I asked her. \u201cYou or the unhappiness in you? Can you see that your unhappiness about being unhappy is just another layer of unhappiness?\u201d She became quiet again. \u201cI am not asking you to do anything. All I'm asking is that you find out whether it is possible for you to allow those feelings to be there. In other words, and this may sound strange, if you don't mind being unhappy, what happens to the unhappiness? Don't you want to find out?\u201d She looked puzzled briefly, and after a minute or so of sitting silently, I suddenly noticed a significant shift in her energy field. She said, \u201cThis is weird. I 'm still unhappy, but now there is space around it. It seems to matter less.\u201dThis was the first time I heard somebody put it like that: There is space around my unhappiness. That space, of course, comes when there is inner acceptance of whatever you are experiencing in the present moment.I didn't say much else, allowing her to be with the experience. Later she came to understand that the moment she stopped identifying with the feeling, the old painful emotion that lived in her, the moment she put her attention on it directly without trying to resist it, it could no longer control her thinking and so become mixed up with a mentally constructed story called \u201cThe Unhappy Me.\u201d Another dimension had come into her life that transcended her personal past \u2013 the dimension of Presence. Since you cannot be unhappy without an unhappy story, this was the end of her unhappiness. It was also the beginning of the end of her pain-body. Emotion in itself is not unhappiness. Only emotion plus an unhappy story is unhappiness. When our session came to an end, it was fulfilling to know that I had just witnessed the arising of Presence in another human being. The very reason for our existence in human form is to bring that dimension of consciousness into this world. I had also witnessed a diminishment of the pain-body, not through fighting it but through bringing the light of consciousness to it.": "Eckhart",

Deep in his soul, in that hidden place that can only be discovered when a person finds himself poised on the edge of the abyss, gasping what he thought was his last breath, he'd suddenly seen it. Only then did he realize what he held dearest in his heart.

  "He spent two years in the extermination camp at Auschwitz. According to his own reluctant account, he came this close to going up a smokestack of a crematorium there: \"I had just been assigned to the Sonderkommando,\" he said to me, \"when the order came from Himmler to close the ovens down.\" Sonderkommando means special detail. At Auschwitz it meant a very special detail indeed--one composed of prisoners whose duties were to shepherd condemned persons into gas chambers, and then to lug their bodies out. When the job was done, the members of the Sonderkommando were themselves killed. The first duty of their successors was to dispose of their remains. Gutman told me that many men actually volunteered for the Sonderkommando. \"Why?\" I asked him. \"If you would write a book about that,\" he said, \"and give the answer to that question, that 'Why?'--you would have a very great book.\" \"Do you know the answer?\" I said. \"No,\" he said, \"That is why I would pay a great deal of money for a book with the answer in it.\" \"Any guesses?\" I said. \"No,\" he said, looking me straight in the eye, \"even though I was one of the ones who volunteered.\"He went away for a little while, after having confessed that. And he thought about Auschwitz, the thing he liked least to think about. And he came back, and he said to me: \"There were loudspeakers all over the camp,\" he said, \"and they were never silent for long. There was much music played through them. Those who were musical told me it was often good music--sometimes the best.\" \"That's interesting,\" I said. \"There was no music by Jews,\" he said. \"That was forbidden.\" \"Naturally,\" I said. \"And the music was always stopping in the middle,\" he said, \"and then there was an announcement. All day long, music and announcements.\" \"Very modern,\" I said. He closed his eyes, remembered gropingly. \"There was one announcement that was always crooned, like a nursery rhyme. Many times a day it came. It was the call for the Sonderkommando.\" \"Oh?\" I said. \"Leichent\u00e4rger zu Wache,\" he crooned, his eyes still closed. Translation: \"Corpse-carriers to the guardhouse.\"In an institution in which the purpose was to kill human beings by the millions, it was an understandably common cry. \"After two years of hearing that call over the loudspeakers, between the music,\" Gutman said to me, \"the position of corpse-carrier suddenly sounded like a very good job.": "Kurt",

And I told him of the adventures they had, the places they had gone, and the things I had seen that I had never expected to.

I mean, praying to be free of Hiskott only makes me expect to be free soon, and then when the prayer\u2019s never answered, you feel even worse, and you wonder what\u2019s the point. I\u2019m not criticizing God, if that\u2019s what you think, because nobody knows why God does things or how He thinks, and He\u2019s humongously smarter than any of us, even smarter than Ed. They say He works in mysterious ways, which is for sure true. What I\u2019m saying is, maybe the whole praying business is a human idea, maybe God never asked us to do it. Yeah, all right, He wants us to like Him, and He wants us to respect Him, so we\u2019ll live right and do good. But God is good\u2014right?\u2014and to be really good you\u2019ve got to have humility, we all know that, so then if God is the best of the best, then He\u2019s also the humblest of the humble. Right? So maybe it embarrasses Him to be praised like around the clock, to be called great and mighty all the time. And maybe it makes Him a little bit nuts the way we\u2019re always asking Him to solve our problems instead of even trying to solve them ourselves, which He made us so we could do. Anyway, so after almost giving up on prayer, and being pretty darned sure that God is too humble to sit around all day listening to us praise Him and beg Him, the funny thing is, I\u2019m praying like crazy for Oddie.

  "Men speak of God\u2019s love for man\u2026 but if providence does not come in this hour, where is He then? My conclusion is simple. The Semitic texts from Bronze Age Palestine of which Christianity is comprised still fit uncomfortably well with contemporary life. The Old Testament depicts a God capricious and cruel; blood sacrifice, vengeance, genocide; death and destruction et al. Would He not approve of Herr Hitler and the brutal, tribalistic crusade against Hebrews and non-Christian \u2018untermensch?\u2019One thing is inarguable. His church on Earth has produced some of the most vigorous and violent contribution to the European fascist cause.It is synergy.

  "...With a religious book it is less what we see in it than what we see through it that matters. J. R. R. Tolkien's fairy-tale epic the Lord of the Rings helps draw the distinction perhaps. Some of its admirers have tried to make it into a religion book by claiming, among other things, that the Ring of Power which must be destroyed is the hydrogen bomb. Tolkien, on the other hand, denied this unequivocally. But intended or otherwise, there can be little doubt that for many it has become a religious book. The \"Frodo Lives\" buttons are not entirely a joke, because something at least comes to life through those fifteen hundred pages, although inevitably it is hard to say just what. It seems to have something to do with the way Tolkien has of making us see the quididity of things like wood, bread, stone, milk, iron, as though we have never seen them before or not for a long time, which is probably the truth of the matter; his landscapes set deeper echoes going in us than any message could. He gives us back a sense that we have mostly lost of the things of the earth, and because we are ourselves of the earth, whatever else, we are given back too some sense of our own secret. Very possibly again he did not intend it. I may well be axiomatic that, religiously, a writer achieves most when he is least conscious of doing so. Certainly the attempt to be religious is as doomed as the attempt to be poetic is.": "Frederick",

  "Viewed in this light, life itself appears as a dynamics of integration that is equipped with auto-therapeutic or 'endo-clinical' competencies and refers to a species-specific space of surprise. It has an equally innate and - in higher organisms - adaptively acquired responsibility for the injuries and invasions it regularly encounters in its permanently allocated environment or conquered surroundings. Such immune systems could equally be described as organismic early forms of a feeling for transcendence: thanks to the efficiency of these devices, which are constantly at the ready, the organism actively confronts the potential bringers of its death, opposing them with its endogenous capacity to overcome the lethal. Such functions have earned immune systems of this type comparisons to a 'body police' or border patrol. But as the concern, already at this level, is to work out a modus vivendi with foreign and invisible powers - and, in so far as these can bring death, 'higher' and 'supernatural' ones - this is a preliminary stage to the behaviour one is accustomed to terming religious or spiritual in human contexts.

  "Error regarding life necessary to life. - Every belief in the value and dignity of life rests on false thinking; it is possible only through the fact that empathy with the universal life and suffering of mankind is very feebly developed in the individual. Even those rarer men who think beyond themselves at all have an eye, not for this universal life, but for fenced-off portions of it. If one knows how to keep the exceptions principally in view, I mean the greatly gifted and pure of soul, takes their production for the goal of world-evolution and rejoices in the effects they in turn produce, one may believe in the value of life, because the one is overlooking all other men: thinking falsely, that is to say. And likewise if, though one does keep in view all mankind, one accords validity only to one species of drives, the less egoistical, and justifies them in face of all the others, then again one can hope for something of mankind as a whole and to this extent believe in the value of life: thus, in this case too, through falsity of thinking. Whichever of these attitudes one adopts, however, one is by adopting in an exception among men. The great majority endure life without complaining overmuch; they believe in the value of existence, but they do so precisely because each of them exists for himself alone, refusing to step out of himself as those exceptions do: everything outside themselves they notice not at all or at most as a dim shadow. Thus for the ordinary, everyday man the value of life rests solely on the fact that regards himself more highly than he does the world. The great lack of imagination from which he suffers means he is unable to feel his way into other beings and thus he participates as little as possible in their fortunes and sufferings. He, on the other hand, who really could participate in them would have to despair of the value of life; if he succeeded in encompassing and feeling within himself the total consciousness of mankind he would collapse with a curse on existence - for mankind has as a whole no goal, and the individual man when he regards its total course cannot derive from it any support or comfort, but must be reduced to despair. If in all he does he has before him the ultimate goallessness of man, his actions acquire in his own eyes the character of useless squandering. But to feel thus squandered, not merely as an individual fruits but as humanity as a whole, in the way we behold the individual fruits of nature squandered, is a feeling beyond all other feelings. - But who is capable of such a feeling? Certainly only a poet: and poets always know how to console themselves.": "Friedrich",
  "Well in those parts (upcountry India) they have were-tigers, or think they have, and I must say that in this case, so far as sworn and uncontested evidence went, they had every ground for thinking so. However, as we gave up witchcraft prosecutions about three hundred years ago, we don\u2019t like to have other people keeping on our discarded practices; it doesn\u2019t seem respectful to our mental and moral position.": "Saki",
  "[Pope] Clement waved his hands in irritation as if to dismiss the very idea. \"The world is crumbling into ruin. Armies are marching. Men and women are dying everywhere, in huge numbers. Fields are abandoned and towns deserted. The wrath of the Lord is upon us and He may be intending to destroy the whole of creation. People are without leaders and direction. They want to be given a reason for this, so they can be reassured, so they will return to their prayers and their obiediences. All this is going on, and you are concerned about the safety of two Jews?": "Iain",

  "Ah! I wish I had the courage to work for the debasement of my contemporaries. What good work it would be to defile their daughters: to insinuate something obscene into the infantile hands which caress each paternal beard and cheek; to poison them, even at the risk of perishing ourselves; to do as those Spanish monks did, who drank death in order that they might persuade the French rabble which had violated their monastery to do likewise.": "R\u00e9my",

  "For man, unlike any other thing organic or inorganic in the universe, grows beyond his work, walks up the stairs of his concepts, emerges ahead of his accomplishments. This you may say of man when theories change and crash, when schools, philosophies, when narrow dark alleys of thought, national, religious, economic, grow and disintegrate, man reaches, stumbles forward, painfully, mistakenly sometimes. Having stepped forward, he may slip back, but only half a step, never the full step back. This you may say and know it and know it. This you may know when the bombs plummet out of the black planes on the market place, when prisoners are stuck like pigs, when the crushed bodies drain filthily in the dust. You may know it in this way. If the step were not being taken, if the stumbling-forward ache were not alive, the bombs would not fall, the throats would not be cut. Fear the time when the bombs stop falling while the bombers live- for every bomb is proof that the spirit has not died. And fear the time when the strikes stop while the great owners live- for every little beaten strike is proof that the step is being taken. And this you can know- fear the time when Manself will not suffer and die for a concept, for this one quality is the foundation of Manself, and this one quality is man, distinctive in the universe.": "John",

  "There is no particular merit in being nice to one's fellow man... We can never establish with certainty what part of our relations with others is a result of our emotions - love apathy, charity of malice - and what part is predetermines by the constant power play among individuals. True human goodness, in all its purity and freedom, can come to the fore only when its recipient has no power. Mankind's true moral test, its fundamental test (which lies deeply buries from view), consists of attitude towards those who are at its mercy: animals.
