  "Poetry always runs away from you - it's very difficult to grasp it, and every time you read it, depending on your conditions, you will have a different grasp of it. Whereas with a novel, once you have read it, you have grasped it.": "Abbas",
  "My favourite room in my house is easily the top room, which is a bedroom but also a bathroom, with a big, wooden carved bath, two huge fireplaces and a raised bit in the corner for performances. I've had some really lovely parties and poetry readings up there.": "Deborah",
  "I know I'm not a wordsmith. And I don't write poetry. Sometimes I think I should, because it's really helpful. But I always wanted to write novels.": "Candace",
  "I definitely used to write a lot at school. Comic poetry and drawings about people.": "Sally",
  "Poetry is for me Eucharistic. You take someone else's suffering into your body, their passion comes into your body, and in doing that you commune, you take communion, you make a community with others.": "Mary",
  "Poetry privileges music and is aesthetically more challenging. Prose privileges information and is emotionally more challenging.": "Mary",
  "Prose cannot compete with the economy of poetry, the ability to have a full artistic experience in a short period of time.": "Mary",
  "Hebrew as a contemporary language, especially for poetry, is no longer the language of the Bible; but neither is it not the language of the Bible.": "Cynthia",
  "I'm conscious of a series of circles working its way through my life. And at this particular moment I have come round to the beginning of my writing cycle. It begins with poetry. There's hardly a day that goes past on which I don't write poetry.": "Ben",
  "I began my writing life as a poet, so poetry has always been fundamental. I evolved from poetry to journalism to stories to novels. But poetry was always there.": "Ben",
  "I've been writing since I was 10 or 11. I started with poetry because that was the easiest thing. It just kind of came naturally. I think at that time West Coast hip hop was huge; all these kids around me were like, 'I want to be a rapper.' But I'm a white girl, not going to be a rapper.": "Sasha",
  "I've always loved the poetry in 'Pale Fire.' I think it's wonderful.": "Jonathan",
  "Poetry is really about your mental state or intellectual, and where you are, and you're trying to evoke that, explain it to yourself, whatever, you're trying to dig into it, analyse yourself.": "Jonathan",
  "I think poetry was always where I went to deal with my deepest feelings.": "Jonathan",
  "I've always used poetry to explain myself to myself. These things just sat in my psyche and then came out.": "Jonathan",
  "I love poetry; it's my primary literary interest, and I suppose the kind of reading you do when you are reading poems - close reading - can carry over into how you read other things.": "Jonathan",
  "Poetry is not mainstream, but then neither is serious fiction, really. But I don't think there's a lot to worry about in this particular 'problem'. Why does art have to be mainstream to be significant?": "Jonathan",
  "I think poetry should be read very much like prose, except that the line breaks should be acknowledged somehow.": "Jonathan",
  "For me, poetry is a situation - a state of being, a way of facing life and facing history.": "Tahar",
  "I came to poetry through the urgent need to denounce injustice, exploitation, humiliation. I know that's not enough to change the world. But to remain silent would have been a kind of intolerable complicity.": "Tahar",
  "I love to read poetry but I haven't written anything that I'm willing to show anybody.": "Abraham",
  "Publishing a volume of verse is like dropping a rose petal down the Grand Canyon and waiting for the echo.": "Don",
  "Poetry is what Milton saw when he went blind.": "Don",
  "All voices are important, and yet it seems that people of color have a lot to say, particularly if you look through the poetry of young people - a lot of questions and a lot of concerns about immigration and security issues, you name it - big questions.": "Juan",
  "I gave my voice to poetry.": "Juan",
  "Poetry, as odd as it is, and as hard to figure out as it is, many times, it's almost something that we're used to. It's kind of like a dream language that we had centuries ago, so that when we speak poetically or write a poem about what's going on, a real difficult issue that's facing our communities, people listen.": "Juan",
  "San Diego shaped me a lot. The visual landscapes, the emotional panoramas, the teachers and mentors I had from the third grade through San Diego High - it's all a big part of the poetry fountain that I continue to drink from.": "Juan",
  "The banner of the project is 'Casa de Colores.' Under that banner, I'm going to invite people to do a lot of good things. Perhaps working in groups, working on poetry.": "Juan",
  "My mother was a washerwoman - or a woman that cleaned houses in Texas... in Plano, Texas - who always loved poetry and always loved stories.": "Juan",
  "I write all the time - I write poetry, I love to write.": "Colin",
  "I'm not a writer. I think I can write short stories and poetry, but film writing, brilliant film writing, is a talent - you can't just do it like that.": "Samantha",
  "It's like I understand images and some people understand poetry.": "Samantha",
  "It's bad poetry executed by people that can't sing. That's my definition of Rap.": "Peter",
  "My favorite subject probably was math. I love math. Figures just intrigue me. I was really good at math. English probably was my worst subject. But I used to write a lot of poetry. I used to write poetry all the time.": "Herschel",
  "Poetry is at the centre of my life, too, emotionally speaking, and intellectually speaking - it's just that I'm one of those people who enjoy doing other stuff as well.": "Andrew",
  "I'm not precisely saying that a really good board meeting at the MLA (Museums, Libraries and Archives Coucil) makes me want to go and write poetry, but there is a pleasure in doing that sort of thing well.": "Andrew",
  "I wish I'd been better able to resist the sense of obligation to write some of the poems I did. It's in the nature of commissioned work to be written too much from the side of your mind that knows what it's doing, which dries up the poetry.": "Andrew",
  "In a general way, I want to be a kind of flag-waver, bunting hanger-up, drum-beater, you name it, for poetry.": "Andrew",
  "Thanks partly to the kind of poets that we now have and partly to funding, there's been a gigantic shift in the way poetry is perceived... Poems on the Underground, poets in schools, football clubs, zoos.": "Andrew",
  "I wanted to reimagine the role, in a way that was respectful of its traditional responsibilities but made them part of a wider pattern of poetry about national incidents, events, preoccupations; and to spend a great deal of time going to schools trying to demystify poetry.": "Andrew",
  "More people are reading poetry now than at any time in the history of the human race.": "Andrew",
  "There is something about poetry beyond prose logic, there is mystery in it, not to be explained but admired.": "Edward",
  "I got scouted for modeling on the street. I'm such a tomboy - still am. I just never thought about modeling before, but I thought, 'Ooh, interesting, similar world, perhaps it's a way into something.' Then, I was on my third photo shoot ever, and Adam Leech from 'Downtown Abbey' saw me reading poetry and asked me to recite some.": "Anya",
  "All through childhood, I wrote verses and mysteries. There is, for me, one connection: structure. My poetry is metrical, rhyming.": "Sophie",
  "Those who have never entered upon scientific pursuits know not a tithe of the poetry by which they are surrounded.": "Herbert",
  "I always credited my mother with inspiring me to be a writer because she was such a passionate reader. She read poetry to me as a child. But rather late in life, I've come to appreciate my father, the accountant. He was a solid, organized, get-the-job-done kind of person-and you need that piece of it to be a writer, too.": "Judith",
  "I thought it would be a funny concept to publish a book about stand-up comedy with Faber, the poetry publisher, and to apply to stand-up the same sort of weight of annotation that you would to a classic work of literature, an epic poem. I thought that would be funny.": "Stewart",
  "I accept all interpretations of my films. The only reality is before the camera. Each film I make is kind of a return to poetry for me, or at least an attempt to create a poem.": "Bernardo",
  "The poet is a specialist in something which everyone practises. Herein, poetry differs from the other arts. Everyone does not practise music or painting or even dancing, but everyone without exception puts together words poetically every day of his life.": "Louis",
  "Everyone is not able, or inclined, to write poetry in the narrower sense any more than everyone is qualified to take part in a walking race. But just as all of us can and do walk, so all of us can and do use language poetically.": "Louis",
  "The rules or 'laws' of poetry are only tentative devices, an approximate scheme. There is no Sinaitic recipe for poetry, for the individual poem is the norm.": "Louis",
  "The novel is born of disillusionment; the poem, of despair.": "Jose",
  "Poetry is adolescence fermented, and thus preserved.": "Jose",
  "Everything is complicated; if that were not so, life and poetry and everything else would be a bore.": "Wallace",
  "To me, art begets art. Painting feeds the eye just as poetry feeds the ear, which is to say that both feed the soul.": "Susan",
  "If you put a real leaf and a silk leaf side by side, you'll see something of the difference between Homer's poetry and anyone else's. There seem to be real leaves still alive in the 'Iliad,' real animals, real people, real light attending everything.": "Alice",
  "Poetry for me is as much a spiritual practice as sexual ecstasy is.": "James",
  "I sometimes talk about the making of a poem within the poem.": "Howard",
  "Everyone thinks they're going to write one book of poems or one novel.": "Marilyn",
  "Poetry remembers that it was an oral art before it was a written art.": "Jorge",
  "I know nothing new except that Herr Gellert, the Leipzig poet, is dead, and has written no more poetry since his death.": "Wolfgang",
  "There is one type of ideal woman very seldom described in poetry - the old maid, the woman whom sorrow or misfortune prevents from fulfilling her natural destiny.": "Lafcadio",
  "No poem is easily grasped so why should any reader expect fast results? ": "John",
  "Sometimes poetry is inspired by the conversation entered into by reading other poems.": "John",
  "An experienced reader uses the poem as an agent of inquiry. This makes poetry very exciting, unstable, and interactive.": "John",
  "I studied poetry in college and for a year in an MFA program. As time went on, my poems got more and more complicated. What I was really trying to do was tell stories.": "Jennifer",
  "I like poems that are little games.": "Peter",
  "I'm quite sure that most writers would sustain real poetry if they could, but it takes devotion and talent.": "Marguerite",
  "I was always making up rhymes. But I never thought that poetry would become my life.": "Saul",
  "Science and art, or by the same token, poetry and prose differ from one another like a journey and an excursion. The purpose of the journey is its goal, the purpose of an excursion is the process.": "Franz",
  "I'll try anything, but the pig testicles in Taiwan were a little much. Eh, it wasn't half bad. There was this one dish I had there, the translation is, 'The Monk Jumps over the Fence.' It's a fish dish with all these spices. It was beautiful, man - it was poetry. It had a whole story.": "Steven",
  "Poetry is a beautiful way of spoiling prose, and the laborious art of exchanging plain sense for harmony.": "Horace",
  "I believe in the power of poetry, which gives me reasons to look ahead and identify a glint of light.": "Mahmoud",
  "I see poetry as spiritual medicine.": "Mahmoud",
  "Against barbarity, poetry can resist only by confirming its attachment to human fragility like a blade of grass growing on a wall while armies march by.": "Mahmoud",
  "That sense of a life in natural objects, which in most poetry is but a rhetorical artifice, was, then, in Wordsworth the assertion of what was for him almost literal fact.": "Walter",
  "Still, language is resilient, and poetry when it is pressured simply goes underground.": "Diane",
  "I really love poetry. I'm a big E.E. Cummings fan and a big Walt Whitman fan, and I have a big book of poetry.": "Mae",
  "I didn't know how to weigh ideas about poetry. Nothing in the life I lived as a student - and later as wife and mother at the suburban edge of Dublin - suggested I had the wherewithal to do so. But I did have a unit of measurement. It was the measure of my own life.": "Eavan",
  "Usually a life turned into a poem is misrepresented.": "Mark",
  "Pain is filtered in a poem so that it becomes finally, in the end, pleasure.": "Mark",
  "You don't help people in your poems. I've been trying to help people all my life - that's my trouble.": "Charles",
  "There'll always be working people in my poems because I grew up with them, and I am a poet of memory.": "Philip",
  "I wonder if I ever thought of an ideal reader... I guess when I was in my 20s and in New York and maybe even in my early 30s, I would write for my wife Janice... mainly for my poet friends and my wife, who was very smart about poetry.": "Kenneth",
  "We all need ways to express ourselves, and poetry is one of mine.": "Jack",
  "Poetry seems to sink into us the way prose doesn't. I can still quote verses I learned when I was very young, but I have trouble remembering one line of a novel I just finished reading.": "Jack",
  "Children seem naturally drawn to poetry - it's some combination of the rhyme, rhythm, and the words themselves.": "Jack",
  "I started out as a writer. Poetry and prose and also kind of satirical David Sedaris-esque stuff.": "Pauley",
  "The first function of poetry is to tell the truth, to learn how to do that, to find out what you really feel and what you really think.": "June",
  "I wanted to write the kind of poetry that people read and remembered, that they lived by - the kinds of lines that I carried with me from moment to moment on a given day without even having chosen to.": "Tracy",
  "I come here to speak poetry. It will always be in the grass. It will also be necessary to bend down to hear it. It will always be too simple to be discussed in assemblies.": "Boris",
  "That is to say, epic poetry has been invented many times and independently; but, as the needs which prompted the invention have been broadly similar, so the invention itself has been.": "Lascelles",
  "Do-gooders are easily overlooked. We're supposed to be soft, touchy-feely types, who wear Birkenstocks, compost everything, and write poetry by candlelight.": "Nancy",
  "The same people who are murdered slowly in the mechanized slaughterhouses of work are also arguing, singing, drinking, dancing, making love, holding the streets, picking up weapons and inventing a new poetry.": "Raoul",
  "You don't have to suffer to be a poet adolescence is enough suffering for anyone. ": "John",
  "Poetry lies its way to the truth.": "John",
  "I used to write sonnets and various things, and moved from there into writing prose, which, incidentally, is a lot more interesting than poetry, including the rhythms of prose.": "Shelby",
  "Poetry is the mother-tongue of the human race.": "Johann",
  "Even when poetry has a meaning, as it usually has, it may be inadvisable to draw it out... Perfect understanding will sometimes almost extinguish pleasure.": "A.",
  "If you read quickly to get through a poem to what it means, you have missed the body of the poem.": "M.",
  "I think there are things in my story that have helped my creativity. Your father being killed, for instance, is one of the best things that could happen to a kid if he's going to write poetry or songs.": "Roger",
  "We all write poems it is simply that poets are the ones who write in words. ": "John",
  "Poetry is the deification of reality.": "Edith",
  "No, what I should really like to do right now, in the full blaze of lights, before this illustrious assembly, is to shower every one of you with gifts, with flowers, with offerings of poetry - to be young once more, to ride on the crest of the wave.": "Knut",
  "Cut quarrels out of literature, and you will have very little history or drama or fiction or epic poetry left.": "Robert",
  "I think that one possible definition of our modern culture is that it is one in which nine-tenths of our intellectuals can't read any poetry.": "Randall",
  "To a poet the mere making of a poem can seem to solve the problem of truth, but only a problem of art is solved in poetry.": "Laura",
  "The end of poetry is not to create a physical condition which shall give pleasure to the mind... The end of poetry is not an after-effect, not a pleasurable memory of itself, but an immediate, constant and even unpleasant insistence upon itself.": "Laura",
  "Well, I write a lot of poetry - that's where it usually all starts. I definitely want to show you guys sides of me - love, loss, heartbreak - all of that good stuff!": "Tristan",
  "Each memorable verse of a true poet has two or three times the written content.": "Alfred",
  "However, if a poem can be reduced to a prose sentence, there can't be much to it.": "James",
  "I used to joke that if acting didn't work out, poetry was my commonsense fallback.": "Merritt",
  "I wrote poetry, journals, and, especially, plays for the neighborhood kids to perform. I had an ordinary, happy childhood. Nothing much was going on, but I had fun.": "Alex",
  "Society's dark hull drifts further and further away. It is this place - the place of our separation, our distinction - that much of his poetry occupies.": "Tomas",
  "I was kind of an outcast in school 'cause I always kept to myself and was writing poetry and then going on tour with my brother band all the time, so kids didn't know what to make of me.": "Christina",
  "And inasmuch as the bridge is a symbol of all such poetry as I am interested in writing it is my present fancy that a year from now I'll be more contented working in an office than ever before.": "Hart",
  "Painting (like poetry) chooses from universals what is most apposite. It brings together, in a single imaginary being, circumstances and characteristics which occur in nature in many different persons.": "Francisco",
  "The job of the poet is to render the world - to see it and report it without loss, without perversion. No poet ever talks about feelings. Only sentimental people do.": "Mark",
  "Reality only reveals itself when it is illuminated by a ray of poetry.": "Georges",
  "How do poems grow? They grow out of your life.": "Robert",
  "The poem is a little myth of man's capacity of making life meaningful. And in the end, the poem is not a thing we see-it is, rather, a light by which we may see-and what we see is life.": "Robert",
  "You don't make a poem with ideas, but with words.": "Stephane",
  "Freedom is poetry, taking liberties with words, breaking the rules of normal speech, violating common sense. Freedom is violence.": "Norman",
  "I intended an Ode, And it turned to a Sonnet.": "Henry",
  "A poem can have an impact, but you can't expect an audience to understand all the nuances.": "Douglas",
  "I've always written poetry and lyrics. My first husband, who was a musician, we wrote a bunch of songs together.": "P.",
  "There is the view that poetry should improve your life. I think people confuse it with the Salvation Army.": "John",
  "Don't call my lyrics poetry. It's an insult to real poets.": "Bernie",
  "I don't look on poetry as closed works. I feel they're going on all the time in my head and I occasionally snip off a length.": "John",
  "The mystic purchases a moment of exhilaration with a lifetime of confusion; and the confusion is infectious and destructive. It is confusing and destructive to try and explain anything in terms of anything else, poetry in terms of psychology.": "Basil",
  "I've been surprised to learn how many people love poetry. It's beautiful to see that people want poetry in their lives.": "Peleg",
  "It's always good to show that poetry isn't the little depressed lyric people believe it to be, that it's something bigger.": "John",
  "In Bonn, where I studied for a year, I changed from classical to Romance philology, taught there by its great founder, F. Diez, and at the beginning of 1852, I received the doctorate for a dissertation on the refrain in Provencal poetry.": "Paul",
  "Poetry is an orphan of silence. The words never quite equal the experience behind them.": "Charles",
  "Poetry is plucking at the heartstrings, and making music with them.": "Dennis",
  "I wrote The Green Eye of the Little Yellow God in five hours, but I had it all planned out. It isn't poetry and it does not pretend to be, but it does what it sets out to do.": "J.",
  "I think of myself as an ambassador of the arts. In my heart of hearts, I know the world would be a more peaceful, tender place if we were more moved by the poetry around us.": "Tim",
  "As a rule, men worry more about what they can't see than about what they can.": "Julius",
  "It was pride that changed angels into devils it is humility that makes men as angels. ": "Saint",
  "There is nothing noble in being superior to your fellow men. True nobility lies in being superior to your former self.": "Ernest",
  "Wise men don't need advice. Fools won't take it.": "Benjamin",

  "The greatest deception men suffer is from their own opinions.": "Leonardo",
  "I believe in the brotherhood of all men, but I don't believe in wasting brotherhood on anyone who doesn't want to practice it with me. Brotherhood is a two-way street.": "Malcolm",
  "Feminism isn't about hating men. It's about challenging the absurd gender distinctions that boys and girls learn from childhood and carry into their adult lives.": "Robert",

  "Men lose all the material things they leave behind them in this world, but they carry with them the reward of their charity and the alms they give. For these, they will receive from the Lord the reward and recompense they deserve.": "Francis",
  "The Industrial Revolution has two phases: one material, the other social; one concerning the making of things, the other concerning the making of men.": "Charles",

  "Men often oppose a thing merely because they have had no agency in planning it, or because it may have been planned by those whom they dislike.": "Alexander",

  "Men rise from one ambition to another: first, they seek to secure themselves against attack, and then they attack others.": "Niccolo",
  "It disturbs me no more to find men base, unjust, or selfish than to see apes mischievous, wolves savage, or the vulture ravenous.": "Jean-Paul",
  "People who have no hold over their process of thinking are likely to be ruined by liberty of thought. If thought is immature, liberty of thought becomes a method of converting men into animals.": "Muhammad",
  "I have often wondered how it is that every man loves himself more than all the rest of men, but yet sets less value on his own opinions of himself than on the opinions of others.": "Marcus",
  "Here in America we are descended in blood and in spirit from revolutionists and rebels - men and women who dare to dissent from accepted doctrine. As their heirs, may we never confuse honest dissent with disloyal subversion.": "Dwight",
  "Civilization is the progress toward a society of privacy. The savage's whole existence is public, ruled by the laws of his tribe. Civilization is the process of setting man free from men.": "Ayn",

  "The superior man is distressed by the limitations of his ability he is not distressed by the fact that men do not recognize the ability that he has. ": "Confucius",
  "The true test of a man's style is the haircut. There are some men who look good no matter how their hair is styled, whether it's trendy or not. A man can change his haircut many times, but to pull off any haircut, you have to be very chic. Like Brad Pitt.": "Carine",
  "All free men, wherever they may live, are citizens of Berlin. And therefore, as a free man, I take pride in the words 'Ich bin ein Berliner!'": "John",

Amnesty's 'soft' approach made me seriously consider alternatives to revenge.": "Maajid",

  "I don't think it's good to run on anger, but it's really great when that's the first couple of gallons in your tank - when you've had enough, and you're just pissed off enough to go for it. In a lot of ways, that sort of environment can be a catapult for a great situation.": "Josh",

  "In general I was a good kid. It usually took a lot to make me mad. But once I reached the boiling point, I lost all rational control.

  "The idea that the law should punish what is rude; that government should protect our tender sensibilities from those who would - quite often with shallow motivations but sometimes with deeper and more serious complaints - challenge our national certainties and rituals, should alarm and anger us.": "Nick",

  "I feel truth, beauty, love, grief, anger, intimacy & alive in my body... Women in the global south live in their bodies much more than we in the global north. Not as distracted by patriarchy's controlling images - They know power is in their bodies. I am deeply grateful for the women who showed me the way home.": "Jodie",
  "There is a latent anger in a lot of people that went to boarding school at an early age. I was eight. And I loved it over the five years, but I think the adjustments for eight-year-olds are a lot. And I think it informs who you are for a long, long time.": "Damian",
  "So many people live with anger and unforgiveness, and many of them are Christians.": "Joyce",
  "You have to understand the Newark Riots - a lot of people understand that the pain was the initial explosion of anger and alienation, but after that, the response, sending the National Guard troops - a lot of violence was carried out and perpetrated by those who were allegedly coming here to protect residents.": "Cory",
  "When you fight, anger drives up testosterone in both men and women.": "Helen",
  "In many ways, anger is a misdirected plea for love.": "Karen",
  "Anger, if used properly, might be for a cause, like helping feed children or stopping abuse somewhere. When we understand that every quality has importance and value, then we open up to this. Shining a light on these shadow qualities gives it balance.": "Debbie",

  "Deep down, my mom had long suspected I was gay... Much of her anger and hurt came from her sense of betrayal that she was the last to be told.": "Chaz",
  "Violence is a problem we all want to solve. I want to make sure that kids learn to deal with anger by learning how to talk with people to solve problems. Here in the United States Senate I want to make sure we have safe schools, safe neighborhoods and good things for kids to do after school!": "Patty",
  "That feeds anger, and I mean when we went and at last thank heavens got towards peace in Northern Ireland we went for justice within Northern Ireland as well as using security well, as well as a political settlement, but surely that is the lesson.": "Clare",

  "The death of Garang has unfortunately unleashed emotions of anger; some genuine, others cultivated by elements who wanted to pit one group of Sudanese against another.": "Salva",
  "All I do is have fun. When I'm not working, it's about making people laugh. I love making jokes about things. Even when someone's mad at me, I'll deflect anger with humor. My days are filled with laughter. If I'm not laughing, I'm not happy.": "Drew",
  "Anger is implanted in us as sort of sting, to make us gnash with our teeth against the devil, to make us vehement against him, not to set us in array against each other.": "Richard",

  "I think, often, when you are in just a lot of pain, it comes out as anger.": "Nell",
  "To anger female voters in America is to tread on the tiger's tail. Women turn out in huge numbers, and they are well aware of how their bodies work and what they need.": "Henry",
  "People are always angry at America. They're absolutely certain that America either caused their problems or is deliberately not fixing their problems. But the anger is always directed at America and never at Americans.": "P.",

  "Listen, Bruce Lee fought out of anger. That's why they call it the 'Fists of Fury.' Michael Jackson danced with fury. I do stand up out of fury. I'm not mad at anybody. I'm not mad at any human being because I'm a human being.": "Tracy",
  "Anger is certainly a kind of baseness, as it appears well in the weakness of those subjects in whom it reigns: children, women, old folks, sick folks.": "Francis",
  "My own approach has always been to push intense emotions down and attempt to deal with them later. When I was younger, I was terrified to express anger because it would often kick-start a horrible reaction in the men in my life.": "Alanis",
  "When someone says that I'm angry it's actually a compliment. I have not always been direct with my anger in my relationships, which is part of why I'd write about it in my songs because I had such fear around expressing anger as a woman.": "Alanis",
  "It's a joke to think that anyone is one thing. We're all such complex creatures. But if I'm going to be a poster child for anything, anger's a gorgeous emotion. It gets a bad rap, but it can make great changes happen.": "Alanis",
  "What influenced me was Tori Amos, who was unapologetic about expressing anger through music, and Sinead O'Connor. Those two in particular were really moving for me, and very inspiring, before I wrote 'Jagged Little Pill.'": "Alanis",
  "Anger has been a really big deal for women: how can we express it without feeling that, as the physically weaker sex, we won't get killed. The alpha-woman was burned at the stake and had her head chopped off in days of old.": "Alanis",

  "I do have anger management issues. Not clinical. Probably no more than most people.": "Andy",
  "My therapist says I still haven't got in touch with my anger. Maybe one day I'm going to explode. But I'm still really happy. I know it looks like a strange and painful upbringing - all those experiences led me to the paths that I'm on now.": "Drew",
  "Fighting in the ring or cage is very much different from fighting in the street. Fighting in the street is very much fueled by anger, pride, and male dominance and ego.": "Joel",
  "Anger is wonderful. It keeps you going. I'm angry about bankers. About the government.": "Terry",
  "President Obama clearly cannot run on his record. All he's offering is more of the same. That's not good. Look at the economy. It's stagnating.

  "Allowing children to show their guilt, show their grief, show their anger, takes the sting out of the situation.": "Martha",

  "As I got older and started moving up the ranking, the matches got more important, and my emotions ratcheted up. I guess I hid my real feelings behind the anger.": "John",
  "The dog is often quick to resent a kick, be it from man or beast, but I have never known him to show anger at the door that slammed to and hit him. Probably, if the door held him by his tail or his limb, it would quickly receive the imprint of his teeth.": "John",

  "I'm too mature to be angry.": "Jesse",
  "Many are observing Ferguson and witnessing the anger, demonstrations, looting and vandalism and calling for quiet. But quiet isn't enough. The absence of noise isn't the presence of justice - and we must demand justice in Ferguson and the other 'Fergusons' around America.": "Jesse",

  "My father had a real short fuse. He had a tough life - had to support his mother and brother at a very young age when his dad's farm collapsed. You could see his suffering, his terrible suffering, living a life that was disappointing and looking for another one. My father was full of terrifying anger.": "Sam",
  "Unpleasant reading on the subject of anger tells us that there's not really anything wrong with it. In limited amounts. It can even be a good thing. A pressure valve.": "Dick",

  "I started a youth center in Houston. The kids would come in and want to learn to box; they wanted to tear up the world, beat up the world. And I'd try to show them they didn't need anger. They didn't need all that killing instinct they'd read about. You can be a human being and pursue boxing as a sport.": "George",

  "Boxing gave me a voice to express the anger I felt for where I came from.": "Gerry",
  "It's usually a big kind of vent of frustration or anger or sadness that puts me in the right frame of mind to write. It's such a cliche to say that artists write when they're down, but it's true for me. It's a relief to get out what's eating away at my heart or my soul or my head.": "Ellie",
  "All improv turns into anger. All comedy improv basically turns into anger, because that's all people know how to do when they're improvising. If you notice shows that are improvising are generally people yelling at each other.": "Albert",
  "I think anger and laughter are very close to each other, when you think about it.": "Albert",
  "Even in my comedies, I don't take anger as a joke. I think anger and laughter are very close to each other, when you think about it. One of the things I like about a character: I always think it's fascinating when a character can turn on a dime and go from one emotion to another. I like watching that.": "Albert",
  "The difference between anger and deep remorse - remorse is much fatter. It's a deeper feeling altogether. Anger is too easy an escape for my money.": "John",
  "I've never felt that anger is a very powerful emotion.": "John",
  "An angry people cannot create anything that is not imbued with anger.": "John",
  "A theme that has always interested me is how women express anger, how women express violence. That is very much part of who women are, and it's so unaddressed. A vast amount of literature deals with cycles of violence about men, antiheroes. Women lack that vocabulary.": "Gillian",
  "Well, all comedy starts with anger. You get angry, and its never for a good reason, right? You know its not a good reason. And then you try and work it from there.": "Jerry",
  "Hizb ut-Tahrir spearheaded the radicalization of the 1990s and cultivated an atmosphere of anger.": "Maajid",
  "When daughters react with annoyance or even anger at the smallest, seemingly innocent remarks, mothers get the feeling that talking to their daughters can be like walking on eggshells: they have to watch every word.": "Deborah",
  "Conversations with sisters can spark extremes of anger or extremes of love. Everything said between sisters carries meaning not only from what was just said but from all the conversations that came before - and 'before' can span a lifetime. The layers of meaning combine profound connection with equally profound competition.": "Deborah",
  "I find there's this weird anger thing: Someone will approach me at the bar and say, 'Hey, can I buy you a drink?' And I'll say, 'No, I'm okay.' And then all of a sudden, there's this male anger flip, where they go, 'Oh, you know what? I wasn't even gonna buy you a drink, 'cause you're not even that cute anyway,' and walk away.": "Hannah",

  "A lot of artists think they want anger. But a real, strong, bitter anger occupies the mind, leaving no room for creativity.": "David",
  "Anger clearly has its proper place at work, which is neither wholly absent nor ever present. The manager who is an emotional blank is just as hard to work for as the volcanic boss, and both can do great harm by setting an unhelpful example for what kind of emotional expression is expected and accepted.": "Julian",
  "The most powerful force in American politics is not anger, it's nostalgia.": "Pete",

  "Anger in the black community towards Republicans is established and immutable.": "Bob",
  "When our neighbor's personality possesses harsh qualities, we show our love by not voluntarily provoking those qualities in any way. Past experience shows us what upsets a person, so in their presence we are careful not to do or say those things that cause anger. We are self-effacing.": "Mother",
  "When anyone arouses my anger, I will immediately pray for them and regain my peace of soul.": "Mother",

  "Anger is so constructive.": "John",
  "I've been in government and politics my entire career, and while I try to keep a level head and a reasonable tone in my commentary, even I can lose my head sometimes and let anger bubble over and burst out. It feels gross, looks ugly, and leaves a lasting mark.": "Dana",
  "It angers me to see armed defenders at the bottom of Lost Cause statues, adding a renewed threat of violence to icons that are themselves part of an ideology of violence and intimidation.": "Ryan",
  "You see all the movies where people say, 'Don't fight out of anger'? They say that for a reason.": "Donald",

  "Anger is a good motivator.": "James",
  "When I interviewed John McCain in 2000 about whether he had taken medication for his anger, I remember thinking, 'Let's see how this is going to work.'": "John",

  "When you're not sure your anger is justified, the thing to do is ask yourself exactly where it's coming from.": "Lynn",

  "I get angry at a principle, not a person.": "Norman",
  "I have rage and anger issues. So I get mad about stuff in real life, and then I yell about it onstage, and luckily, something funny ends up coming out. What I'll do is tape-record it, and it will end up coming out even funnier. And I add more punch lines.": "Lisa",
  "I don't like anybody to be angry with me. I'd rather have friends.": "B.",
  "Shock, confusion, fear, anger, grief, and defiance. On Sept. 11, 2001, and for the three days following the worst terrorist attack on U.S. soil, President George W. Bush led with raw emotion that reflected the public's whipsawing stages of acceptance.": "Ron",

  "Whoever incites anger has a strong insurance against indifference.": "Philip",
  "I think I'm basically the same guy I always was. Maybe I've learned, through experience, to rein in some of the anger and temper they say redheads normally have.": "Willie",
  "A lot of these guys come up and say, 'Man, you were my influence, the way you thrashed the drums.' They don't seem to understand I was thrashing in order to hear what I was playing. It was anger, not enjoyment - and painful.": "Butch",
  "We do have our challenges. Some things don't always work right in Washington, and the anger you see from the electorate, I think, is a reflection of what's not working right.": "Bill",

  "Anger tears me up inside... My own... or anyone else's.": "Betty",
  "Our government is printing money, and it's degrading the living standard of every person in America. It's the cause of frustration, anger, and confusion.": "Steve",
  "When the Left agitates over government policies, it's considered righteous anger. When the Right - and much of the center - agitate, it's painted as the rantings of the criminally and violently insane.": "Monica",
  "My passion and energy get mistaken for anger.": "Gary",
  "I drank for about 25 years getting over the loss of my father and I took the anger out on myself. I did a good job at beating myself up at sometimes. I don't drink anymore but my alcoholic head occasionally says different. 'Nil By Mouth' was a love letter to my father because I needed to resolve some issues in order to be able to forgive him.": "Gary",
  "I asked a shrink: 'Everything is so great. Why am I still so angry?' He said, 'Anger doesn't go away.' I always thought it was kind of a good engine.": "Mike",

  "My whole life, people have been saying, Why are you so angry?": "Fiona",
  "I almost failed out of high school. I nearly gave in to the deep anger and resentment harbored by everyone around me... Whatever talents I have, I almost squandered until a handful of loving people rescued me.": "J.",

  "I want roles without anger and feistiness. I want to show weakness and sadness, some love, some happiness.": "Marlee",

  "Of course we need to show we are a genuine alternative to an unpopular, Conservative-led government. But we need to set ourselves a higher standard than a party offering anger like UKIP.": "Douglas",
  "The upside to anger? Getting it out of your system. You got to express your anger. Then you have room for more positive things. If I hold something in a long time, and then I speak it, it's amazing how the light shines so much brighter.": "Reba",
  "I've been trying to learn how to not be so conflicted about things like my own anger. I've always had a place in my music for my anger as a way of compensating for not having a mechanism to express it in my everyday life. So I've been trying to be more true to myself, and that helps me to chill out a little bit. But politically, uh-uh. No.": "Ani",
  "Men make angry music and it's called rock-and-roll women include anger in their vocabulary and suddenly they're angry and militant. ": "Ani",
  "I think I deal with my anger toward my relationship or about my relationship or about my friendships or my family - I deal with it on stage in a passive-aggressive way, and that can be very harmful if it gets back to them, which it always does.": "Nikki",
  "I think it's too easy to recount your unhappy memories when you write about yourself. You bask in your own innocence. You revere your grief. You arrange your angers at their most becoming angles.": "Margo",
  "I have now been married to my third husband for more than 20 years. But when you've had children with someone you're divorced from, divorce defines everything; it's the lurking fact, a slice of anger in the pie of your brain.": "Nora",
  "One good thing I'd like to say about divorce is that it sometimes makes it possible for you to be a much better wife to your next husband because you have a place for your anger - it's not directed at the person you're currently with.": "Nora",
  "The biggest aggravation in the Arab world, the biggest reason for their anger toward us and the creation of those suicide terrorists, is Israel and the difficulty with the Palestinian issue.": "Mario",
  "I am just sorry my own mother had to live under that regime for most of her life. I was lucky. I got out and, 14 years later, Czechoslovakia became a free country. So I feel anger, even fury, at this bloody system that ruined so many people's lives for no reason whatsoever.": "Martina",
  "How do you redefine love when your idea of love is something that's so violent? When your idea of passion is anger, how do you fix that?": "Rupi",

  "Sometimes you just need to raise your voice. And sometimes a little anger is necessary, to be honest.": "Corey",
  "The great thing about celebrity culture is that they can't seem to stop themselves from displaying their ridiculous behaviour.

  "Anger has a way of seeping into every other emotion and planting itself in there.": "Dane",
  "There's a certain time that when somebody asks you a question, you answer them. I don't think I said anything with venom. If you can express yourself without anger and make it as palatable as you can, that's what you do.": "Reggie",

  "At the time, 1980, people regarded actresses involved with production with a certain amount of fear, resentment and anger.": "Jacqueline",
  "What the media misses is the amount of anger that's out there. Trump didn't create that.": "Stephen",
  "I think that Scottish people, like Canadians, are often misunderstood and what I like about my Scottish friends and relatives is how quickly it can go from love to anger. It's a great dynamic.": "Mike",
  "September 11 was a wake-up call to me. I don't want to contribute to the hate in any shape or form. I now regret in the past being silent about what I have heard in the Islamic discourse and being part of that with my own anger.": "Hamza",
  "Being an activist is about getting things done. It's not about standing around shaking your fist in anger.": "Christine",
  "And I think there's something about conservatives frankly - and the Left, when it comes to their channels of persuasion, are unpersuasive. They are, most of them are hate-filled, obscenity-clogged rants of anger and hatred.": "Karl",
  "It really shocked me just to hear of the fans' response to 'St. Anger' not having guitar solos.": "Kirk",
  "Metallica is like the phoenix rising from the ashes. We set everything on fire, and this is what has risen from it - 'St. Anger' being the fire and 'Death Magnetic' being the phoenix.": "Kirk",
  "People who think that Sylvia Plath was a poor, sensitive poet are not getting that she had great amounts of ambition and anger that moved her along, or she wouldn't have been able to fight against that depression to produce such an incredible body of work by the age of thirty.": "Elizabeth",
  "In high school I dated a white woman. She would come to visit me on the rez. And her dad, who was very racist, didn't like that at all. And he told her one time, 'You shouldn't go on the rez if you're white because Indians have a lot of anger in their heart.'": "Sherman",
  "My biggest influence is rap. It spoke to me, probably because of my upbringing in Christiania. You listen to 'The Chronic' and you can hear that anger and frustration.": "Lukas",
  "When you get frisked by the police at the age of 10, and they empty your schoolbag out in the street and kick your books around and calling you names because of where you live, you just get an anger towards everyone who is outside of your neighborhood.": "Lukas",
  "The anger and the creativity are so closely intertwined with me, and there's plenty of anger left.": "Ingmar",
  "When I played a club in Salt Lake City, I complained to the crowd about the low turnout. It's always good to berate the people who paid to see you because you're upset about the people who didn't show up. It's called misplaced anger, and without it, I wouldn't have an act.": "Andy",
  "Every now and then, when I think about it, I think, 'What would I even talk about onstage?' It's never been, 'I wonder if I'm funny. I wonder if I can come up with jokes.' It's more, 'What would it be like without the leather suit and the anger?'": "Eddie",
  "Perhaps it should be obvious: Adultery is a social threat that arouses raw anger and fear, which the bellicose then need to discharge rather than merely feel, traditionally on the philandering wife or the female home-wrecker.": "Mary",
  "I use the music to vent, and a lot of the stuff that I am writing about or was writing about contained a lot of anger and anxiety, stress and depression, so that's how the album came out so dark.": "Vanilla",
  "The Internet is a cauldron of anger every day, every year, election year or not, with unemployment at 10 percent or at two percent. It isn't exactly a good index of what's happening.": "Charles",
  "Fear, separation, hate and anger come from the wrong view that you and the Earth are two separate entities, the Earth is only the environment. You are in the centre, and you want to do something for the Earth in order for you to survive.": "Nhat",
  "I don't display emotions. I have every feeling that everyone else has, but I've developed ways to suppress them. Anger is one of my most comfortable feelings.": "Curtis",
  "Sometimes, you have to make the choice to forgive 10 times a day when you have these pockets of anger come up. That's a lot of work, but to me it's worthwhile.": "Amanda",
  "I've become a lot more tolerant; I think before I talk. I can take a lot now. I don't get as angry as I used to. Whenever I do, I channel my anger into my work.": "Anurag",
  "He took over anger to intimidate subordinates, and in time anger took over him.": "Milan",
  "Caregiving requires the intention of love, caretaking requires the intention of fear. Not acting in anger when you are angry requires the intention of love.": "Gary",

  "People are unjust to anger - it can be enlivening and a lot of fun.": "Philip",
  "I am a danger to myself if I get angry.": "Oriana",

  "Eventually, I moved from a place of anger toward the Jews of Israel toward a place of embrace.": "Ayman",
  "Many of us who have cars have felt some form of extreme anger at other drivers because we feel they have put us in harm's way. We might even envision ramming their cars or cutting them off in return, but do we actually do it? No, because the overwhelming majority of us never want to take another human life.": "Taya",
  "I guess I probably make violent films partly because I can't express my anger in my real life very well.": "Park",
  "So I'm not worried about the emotions I carry with me, because I'm happy that I have them; I think it's good for the work I do. The emotions that are not healthy are the ones you hold inside, like anger.": "Diana",
  "It's that evil twin part of me that always comes out at the absolute wrong political moment, like a demon possessing my soul; it exhibits itself as an arrogance or disdain or obnoxiousness or meanness or anger or pettiness - all traits that are lethal in politics.": "Peter",

  "I believe anger is a wasted emotion, and I don't like to waste emotions.": "Jim",
  "Contempt is the only asymmetrical expression in the muscular facial system: Disgust, fear, happiness, surprise and anger typically express themselves symmetrically. Contempt is marked by one lip corner pulled up and in a dismissive sneer.": "Pamela",
  "When we can lay down our fear and anger and choose responses other than aggression, we create the conditions for bringing out the best in us humans.": "Margaret",
  "My humour has always come from anger, but I have to make sure I don't just get angry and jump on a soapbox.": "Carl",

  "On banks, I make no apology for attacking spivs and gamblers who did more harm to the British economy than Bob Crow could achieve in his wildest Trotskyite fantasies, while paying themselves outrageous bonuses underwritten by the taxpayer. There is much public anger about banks and it is well deserved.": "Vince",
  "Something my mum taught me years and years and years ago, is life's just too short to carry around a great bucket-load of anger and resentment and bitterness and hatreds and all that sort of stuff.": "Kevin",
  "Imagine how much capital a country like Argentina might attract - if instead of defaulting seriatim and affecting a pose of anger toward creditors, it borrowed responsibly and honored its obligations.": "Paul",
  "I grew up looking at my father as to how to behave. In watching him I grasped so many things. His own temperament was of a calm person. He was very composed and I never saw anger in him. To me, that was fascinating.": "Sachin",
  "Once in a while, I still witness occasionally sexist behavior and comments from men (which experience has taught me you should always deflect with humour rather than anger). Old habits die hard, after all, and it's unrealistic to expect dinosaurs to fall silent overnight.": "Maelle",
  "As the plane got closer to Miami, I had this terrible feeling he was dying. Maybe he was telling me that he was going. I felt anger, panic, despair and helplessness.": "Robin",
  "Quite a lot of our contemporary culture is actually shot through with a resentment of limits and the passage of time, anger at what we can't do, fear or even disgust at growing old.": "Rowan",
  "I wasn't a very academic kid, and music was the way for all that feeling and angst and sex and love and anger to be channelled.": "Dave",

  "I resisted writing a book for a long time because I didn't want to invade anyone else's privacy or hurt anyone or anger anyone.": "Alana",
  "In one sense, every character you create will be yourself. You've never murdered, but your murderer's rage will be drawn from memories of your own extreme anger. Your love scenes will contain hints of your own past kisses and sweet moments.": "Nancy",
  "People have said I'm the candidate of anger. Well, we have a right to be angry. We lost 3 million jobs. We lost our place as the moral leader of the world.": "Howard",
  "I had lived with my mother in anger and love - I suppose most daughters do - but my children only knew her in one way: As the lady who thought they were smarter than Albert Einstein. As the lady who thought they wrote better than William Shakespeare. As the lady who thought every picture they drew was a Rembrandt.": "Judith",
  "But one of the hardest things for me to do was to access anger. I could do it on stage. But when I did it on film it was hard for me. That probably has to do with the intimacy of film. And my own personal issues with expressing anger. So I had to learn how to do that.": "Ellen",
  "There's no anger ever in a spiritual. There's always the dream of a hope of a better day coming. That God understands the troubles that I'm experiencing.": "Jessye",
  "I had a lot of anger because I wasn't happy with the way I had been raised.": "Patrick",
  "Green Arrow has gone through so many changes; he's been right-wing, he's been left-wing, he's been rich, he's been poor, he's been a social justice guy, then when I got him, he was a rich playboy guy. So it was a lot harder to get into a character that has so many personas in the past, and I just looked at his anger.": "Ann",
  "Tel Aviv is buzzing with so much life, you could bottle it and sell it as honey, and even Jerusalem has a certain fizz. But if you want to see anger, go to Sheikh Jarrah in East Jerusalem on a Friday afternoon.": "Clive",
  "Psychologists, for reasons of clinical necessity or vagaries of temperament, have chosen to dissect and catalog the morbid emotions - depression, anger, anxiety - and to leave largely unexamined the more vital, positive ones.": "Kay",
  "If you're writing about angry people, you use the language of anger. If you're writing about desperate people, you use the language of desperation.": "Chris",
  "I think anger is a normal response to something horrible that someone has done, another human being has done, and to rob people of life, and that's actually healthy to have, to feel that. At some point you have to figure out, 'How do I let that go?'": "Adam",

  "He that will be angry for anything will be angry for nothing.": "Sallust",
  "It doesn't pay to say too much when you are mad enough to choke. For the word that stings the deepest is the word that is never spoke, Let the other fellow wrangle till the storm has blown away, then he'll do a heap of thinking about the things you didn't say.": "Jules",
  "God's love-eye does not see essentially into the wicked rebellious apostate soul; neither also into the devil, but his anger-eye sees thereinto; that is, God, according to the property of the anger or fire of wrath, sees in the devil, and in the false soul.": "Jakob",
  "Anger, and the self-righteousness that is both the cause and consequence of anger, tends to be easier on the psyche than personal responsibility.": "Barry",
  "We are children of the eternity: But this world is an out-birth out of the eternal and its palpability taketh its original in the anger the eternal nature is its root. ": "Jakob",

  "When you feel bad, find a person to talk to and cry with, to tell of your anger and other helpless feelings.": "Clarissa",
  "I think there is a big difference between expressing the pain and anger that many African Americans and other people of color may feel versus language that I think now crosses the line and goes into hate.": "Michael",
  "All anger is not sinful, because some degree of it, and on some occasions, is inevitable. But it becomes sinful and contradicts the rule of Scripture when it is conceived upon slight and inadequate provocation, and when it continues long.": "Wilson",
  "I was a confused young girl with so much tragedy. Sometimes when you're going through stuff, the last person you're thinking exists is God. I mean, it was my confusion, the anger that was in my heart, all that drama. But thank God I know God now, okay?": "Tasha",
  "I'm a bit of an expert on anger, having suffered from it all through my youth, when I was both brunt and font. It's certainly the most miserable state to be in but it's also tremendously gratifying, really - rage feels justified.": "Deborah",
  "Ours is a country where anything can be accomplished if enough people get angry... because, in America, we act on our collective anger.": "Andrew",
  "I think anger is a good thing.": "Steve",
  "Like every art form, there are jealousies and angers and competitiveness in magic. But there's camaraderie among magicians, whether you perform it for a living or you're an enthusiast.": "Ricky",

  "On stage, I find anger at the unfairness of the world easily.": "Jessica",
  "A dirty player is somebody who ultimately is trying to hurt somebody. There's a huge difference. There's no gray in that. Like, you have no conscience, no nothing, no guilt. I don't have that mean streak in me. I don't play angry. It's not anger.": "Ndamukong",
  "It's very shocking, I think, for people caring for the dying to realise how unsaintly they feel, how much anger is mixed up with their grief. In fact, often I think the anger that they feel is a form of grief; it's a kind of raging against what's happening.": "Helen",
  "I'd be lying if I said I wasn't angry some days. But I really have worked hard to put a lot of the anger and disappointment in the past.": "Monica",
  "I suppose there's an anger in all of us. Some hidden rage that you keep at bay.": "Dominic",
  "Nobody can take what I love away from me. I would like to believe that love is the only energy I've ever used as a writer. I've never written out of anger, although anger has informed love.": "Athol",
  "I've learned that football sometimes was an outlet. It was a way for me to release anger, release frustration.": "Emmitt",
  "Of the seven deadly sins, anger has long been the one with the best box of costumes. When the guy in the next car rages at you, he's dangerous. When you rage at him, you're just. We can usually recognize the results of anger, especially in others, as destructive and evil.": "Frederica",
  "I'm not sure why there's this anger in the youth, but we need to talk about it. Kids need to get help if they need help, and bullies need to be helped as well.": "Crystal",
  "I have a lot of anger about my childhood - being hard of hearing and my relationship with my father.": "Lou",
  "My tastes lean toward the more negative, angry and eclectic.": "Josh",
  "I think photographers are too polite. There is not enough anger in photography it's pretty much trivialized. ": "Duane",
  "I've spent a lot of time and money trying to keep my anger in control.": "Yancy",
  "If there are a couple of adjectives people use to describe me, anger is usually in there. I've never taken that as criticism. It's the way I naturally communicate. But I'm not faux-angry, like Lewis Black, or angry like a gun-toting crazy person. I'm just angry in a mild way - it's not like I'm going to do anything about it.": "David",
  "Since the time of Richard Nixon, there has been a strange lack of will in the media to identify the real cause for Americans' anger at politicians who fall, publicly and spectacularly.": "Mimi",
  "I would say that I definitely became much more religious. They say there are no atheists in foxholes, and this stroke put me into a very deep foxhole. Yet that feeling of faith sustained me, so I have no feelings of anger or regret.": "Mark",
  "Never go to bed angry, stay up and fight.": "William",
  "Americans are slow to anger, but once they do get angry, they are impossible to stop.": "Kathleen",
  "I guess because I had such a horrible life growing up, going from place to place not knowing what I was gonna do and ending up being homeless, there was a lot of pain and a lot of anger that was coming out through my guitar playing.": "Dave",
  "There aren't very many good models of feminine rage - and the ones that we remember are ones where women take that anger internally and implode themselves in a real way, like Anna Karenina or Emma Bovary.": "Lauren",
  "But on second thought, after I decreed the state of emergency, I came to the conclusion that that was impossible to achieve without bloodshed because the street protesters were full of anger and nearly out of control. This is why I thought we needed to find another way out.": "Eduard",
  "I'm not a screamer. I'm confrontational, but I don't think that translates into anger.": "Rachel",
  "I've got rid of a lot of cynicism and anger. I feel positive about my development, and I just want to carry on making music and building myself as a person.": "King",

  "Anger is never without an argument, but seldom with a good one.": "George",
  "There's simply anger over the accountability that Yelp brings and also this feeling of powerlessness because so much power is now being put in the hands of the consumer. But the important thing that gets lost with some of these business owners who are very upset with us is it's the whole picture that counts.": "Jeremy",
  "Dying peacefully means to avoid any immediate cause for anger, fear, or strong desire.": "Lobsang",
  "A certain amount of anger doesn't make us less empathetic, less humane, less loving. It just makes us real.": "Lindsay",

  "After my second-to-last record, 'The Greatest', I had gone on tour for a while, and I didn't play an instrument for about five years. And I got kind of - it's not self-esteem or whatever, or anger toward myself - but disappointed in myself that I hadn't been challenging myself to learn musically.": "Cat",
  "A man can submit today in order to resist tomorrow. My submission had been such.

And there were nearly ten million others who had submitted with equal anger and bitterness.": "Peter",
  "There never was a social change in America without angry people at the heart.": "Keith",
  "I guess lyrically they're similar because they're talking about escaping the kind of misery that likes company. 'The Last One Alive,' for me, is very simple. It's just about alienation, really, that causes anger.": "Jon",
  "To rule one's anger is well to prevent it is better. ": "Tryon",
  "The more anger towards the past you carry in your heart, the less capable you are of loving in the present.": "Barbara",

  "Acting in anger and hatred throughout my life, I frequently precipitated what I feared most, the loss of friendships and the need to rely upon the very people I'd abused.": "Luke",
  "Unless and until Barack Obama addresses the full depth of Americans' anger with his full arsenal of policy smarts and political gifts, his presidency and, worse, our economy will be paralyzed.": "Frank",
  "If anger proceeds from a great cause, it turns to fury; if from a small cause, it is peevishness; and so is always either terrible or ridiculous.": "Jeremy",
  "I feel playful aggression is important for children because they have to deal with all kinds of anger and aggression in their lives.": "Brian",
  "Anger is a transient hatred or at least very like it. ": "Robert",
  "Always write angry letters to your enemies. Never mail them.": "James",
  "I did not think that I was angry, but clearly anger was reflected in my writing. I did not think that I had been affected emotionally, but it was clear from my writing that I was still very emotional about the trial some six months after it ended.": "Christopher",
  "The Anger Management Tour was another beautiful thing. I loved that tour.": "Obie",
  "What if you threw a protest and no one showed up? The lack of angst and anger and emotion is a big positive.": "Jay",
  "I have moments of darkness, of anger, and moments of rage. They do creep up at the most inopportune times. Not to recognize that in my music would give people a sense of sainthood that I don't necessarily have or even want to have.": "K'naan",
  "He best keeps from anger who remembers that God is always looking upon him.": "B.",
  "There's definitely ways to get your anger out and not have to yell and kick and scream and fight people. That's not my jam. That's never how I've been.": "Sasheer",
  "For all my success with the Ramones, I carried around fury and intensity during my career. I had an image, and that image was anger. I was the one who was always scowling, downcast. I tried to make sure I looked like that when I was getting my picture taken.": "Johnny",
  "I'm not angry, I'm not an angry person, but I do sometimes like playing with the perception of anger, as in pretending that I'm more angry than I actually am, and sometimes it works quite well.": "Calvin",
  "I do think anger is so difficult for women. Girls think it undermines their femininity it's not very ladylike. ": "Koren",
  "The further away we got from 9/11, the more I wanted to find some way to recover. I wanted to talk about the more anonymous corners of the city, because I think it's very important that not all of that anger was turned to revenge.": "Colum",
  "Being told about the effects of climate change is an appeal to our reason and to our desire to bring about change. But to see that Africans are the hardest hit by climate change, even though they generate almost no greenhouse gas, is a glaring injustice, which also triggers anger and outrage over those who seek to ignore it.": "Sigmar",
  "I think what I learned in research is that as Americans, we're very distrustful of anger. We're not sure if we should repress it. The idea that anger is supposed to be controlled is American, and we try to keep it out of our homes.": "Koren",
  "We are taught to believe it's bad to be angry, or at least it's not good. That's not the case all throughout the world. People are more open and not embarrassed about it. For instance in Paris, people believe Americans have a really unhealthy relation with anger. They think it's essential to get angry.": "Koren",
  "I think, for one, we have to really accept that anger is a normal human emotion that can be a positive force for change.": "Koren",
  "There is a real sense of anger among many people who are married that the government, any government, thinks it has the ability to change the definition of an institution like marriage.": "Philip",
  "I'm not like most comedians. I don't deal with just heckles - I'm also dealing with threats and anger. Here I am, a brown person on stage being quite blunt. I talk about white privilege; I talk about U.S. imperialistic practices; I talk about colonialism. I'm not saying things that are easy for people to laugh at.": "Hari",
  "Bosnia is under my skin. It's the place you cannot leave behind. I was obsessed by the nightmare of it all; there was this sense of guilt, and an anger that has become something much deeper over these last years.": "Paddy",
  "It's true - my mother kicked me out the house at 14. I had to go live with my sister. I had some problems. I was very rebellious as a kid. I don't even know why or where it came from, but I had a lot of anger. Me and my mom clashed a lot because she didn't tolerate that, as she shouldn't from a 14-year-old.": "Michael",
  "I do play football no-holds-barred. Any edge I can get, I'll take. I'd grab a face mask only in a fit of anger. Uncontrolled anger is damn near insane.": "Joe",

  "I've purged myself of bitterness and anger and remained open to love.": "Tatum",
  "I was never jailed. The fact is that I was arrested, but I went into a diversion programme, and by that time I'd already begun working in what was called anger management. It was a painful and awful moment.": "David",
  "I've done a lot of dramedies in my career. You know, I started as a standup comic, and then the movies that I was doing, like 'Up Side of Anger' were kind of like - they're hard. They're hard to sell; they're hard to get made, you know.": "Mike",
  "I literally used to stare at my face in the mirror with hate and anger. I'd focus on those gigantic zits and just wail about what a monster I was, how I would never have a career because of my gross skin. I couldn't pass a mirror with out thinking about how hideous my skin was and how I wished I was someone else, someone with perfect skin.": "Stephanie",
  "I share the anger, but, ultimately, to govern this country, it takes more than anger. It takes experience. It takes positions that reflect the best values of the American people.": "Joe",

  "It's a very difficult thing for people to accept, seeing women act out anger on the screen. We're more accustomed to seeing men expressing rage and women crying.": "Rebecca",
  "If either player abandon the game by quitting the table in anger, or in an otherwise offensive manner; or by momentarily resigning the game; or refuses to abide by the decision of the Umpire, the game must be scored against him.": "Howard",
  "Fear usually looks like anger.": "Krista",
  "Our task, of course, is to transmute the anger that is affliction into the anger that is determination to bring about change. I think, in fact, that one could give that as a definition of revolution.": "Barbara",
  "The thing that started the peace movement in Ireland was anger - my anger. It wasn't anger it was fury. ": "Betty",

  "Anger's not a good emotion.": "Lincoln",
  "Many churches are measuring the wrong things. We measure things like attendance and giving, but we should be looking at more fundamental things like anger, contempt, honesty, and the degree to which people are under the thumb of their lusts. Those things can be counted, but not as easily as offerings.": "Dallas",
  "It is good to forget one's anger against one's wrongdoer, whoever he may be, for countless number of evils will quickly grow from this anger.": "Thiruvalluvar",

  "And we know there has been horrendous loss of life and suffering and we know that there is anger. Anyone who came anywhere near the general election in constituencies with a substantial Muslim population knows that.": "Clare",
  "I vent my anger in the gym, and it calms me down.": "Samantha",
  "I'm fascinated by rap and by hip-hop. I think there's a lot of poetry in it. There's a lot of anger, a lot of social energy in it. And I think you'd better listen to it pretty carefully, 'cause it's important.": "John",
  "If you're an actor, and you're selfish and not strong, it's difficult to maintain a good personal life or a solid career, and I was selfish and had a lot of anger that went way back.": "Seymour",

  "It's something that black men still go through to this day, which is women clutching their purses, hitting the lock button on store, or just basic attitudes.

  "I know of no more disagreeable situation than to be left feeling generally angry without anybody in particular to be angry at.": "Frank",
  "It's interesting when you're in your thirties and you're not the same pretty boy that you were when you were 21. I think people's anger at themselves getting older is projected on to you because you become a symbol of that.": "Rupert",
  "I had a job when I was 15 working at a supermarket, and I knocked over a stack of plastic coffee cups. In my anger, I threw one at a concrete wall, and it rebounded back into my head and cut my head open. Stupidest way to get a scar, but it's one that I have.": "Antony",
  "Another night, I dreamed I saw my father sweeping out the barn floor clean, and would not suffer the wheat to be brought in the barn. He appeared to me to be in anger.": "Joanna",
  "We are not actually in charge of life, yet behave as if we are the masters of our own destiny. The realization of this fact is quite a hard one. The ridiculousness of our pomposity and presumption can only result in anger or humor.": "Billy",
  "In between shooting for 'Awake,' I was attempting to have my own pilot season. The audition for 'Anger Management' actually came during a week that I was already testing for a couple other shows and we weren't really letting any other shows into the mix.": "Daniela",
  "On 'Awake,' we would take a couple hours per scene. Whereas on 'Anger Management,' we can take maybe 10 minutes on a scene if we're lucky.": "Daniela",
  "I get really angry when I get hungry. If you don't feed me, I won't talk to you. That's when my anger issues come out.": "Daniela",
  "I feel like everything comes into your life for a reason. With 'Awake,' I got to do a drama, and with 'Anger Management,' that's my comedy.": "Daniela",
  "I usually get all my stress and anger out at the gym. But when I get out, I'm kind of a pleasant person - really.": "Natalie",
  "Through the years I have seen myself as a peaceful person, but the awareness of the anger is part of that process.": "Yusef",

  "Insurgents have capitalized on popular resentment and anger towards the United States and the Iraqi government to build their own political, financial and military support, and the faith of Iraqi citizens in their new government has been severely undermined.": "Tom",

  "As with fascism, the rise of Islamic totalitarianism has partly to do with its populist appeal to the class resentments of an economically oppressed population and to anger at political subordination and humiliation.": "Ellen",

  "I may have been the only candidate in America who failed to ride the wave of anti-establishment anger to victory.": "Mickey",
  "The reason why I love people, and writing about them, is because they don't always respond with hate and anger. If they did I wouldn't have a story to tell. Who wants to know about someone who was brutalised and became brutal? I'm interested in the exceptions.": "Chris",
  "You can survive with anger, but you can't live with it forever.": "Ariel",
  "As a child growing up in San Francisco in the 1950s, I sometimes met insults when I ventured outside of Chinatown or my neighborhood. I have even been spat on and threatened with a knife. I could have let my anger fester until it became hate. However, I realized they were isolated incidents, and I simply got on with my life.": "Laurence",
  "Fairest and dearest, your wrath and anger are more heavy than I can bear; but learn that I cannot tell what you wish me to say without sinning against my honour too grievously.": "Marie",
  "A wonderful emotion to get things moving when one is stuck is anger. It was anger more than anything else that had set me off, roused me into productivity and creativity.": "Mary",
  "The anger that Uncle Junior has comes from my background. My father was the son of an Italian immigrant, and I've seen the fire of the Italian temperament. It can be explosive sometimes in ways that are both funny and tragic.": "Dominic",
  "The American people are smart. They've gotten sick of the predictable hyperpartisan talking points and canned anger.": "John",
  "Having a sweet, wide-eyed, awkward character is more charming and allows for more range. If you come from anger, you're going to reach a ceiling very quickly.": "Toks",
  "I realised one day that men are emotional cripples. We can't express ourselves emotionally, we can only do it with anger and humour. Emotional stability and expression comes from women.": "Bob",
  "The nice thing about anger is that, as an emotion, it's strong enough to unplug me from the comedian's mind for a minute and just be a frustrated member of the citizenry.": "Seth",
  "Ridicule is the first and last argument of a fool.": "Charles",
  "If you lead with the anger, it will turn off the audience. And what I want is the audience to engage with the material and to listen and then to ask questions. I think that 'Ruined' was very successful at doing that.": "Lynn",
  "Sometimes with anger you can be much more dangerous than with skill.": "Mathieu",
  "You cannot get ahead while you are getting even.": "Dick",
  "The preparation, commitment and desire to win will be no less than the last time I drove a grand prix car in anger.": "Nigel",
  "It absolutely helped - to write the father in both 'Juicy' and 'Beasts,' I had to see the whole story from his point of view. All of a sudden I understood more of what my own father must be going through - the fear, the frustration, the anger... the hope that he'll leave a legacy.": "Lucy",
  "The forces that have worked hard to stoke populist anger against reform are the very ones that benefit from a health system which puts profits ahead of quality care for its patients.": "Jerrold",
  "If somebody honks a horn in Cleveland, they're saying 'Hi.' It's so rare to be honked at in anger. When we have merging traffic, we just interweave. There's real courtesy.": "Mary",
  "I think a certain amount of anger has been a fuel of mine, if you want - but also some sort of sadness, and plain mischief, of course.": "Siouxsie",
  "Everybody in America is angry about something.": "Anthony",

  "We suffered a terrible blow on 11 September 2001. We responded with fear and anger. A fight-or-flight response is adaptive in any species. For us, given our power, fight was the only response we could imagine.": "Yochai",
  "When a man is wrong and won't admit it, he always gets angry.": "Thomas",
  "A hungry man is an angry one.": "Buchi",
  "I was a pretty angry kid, and I got into military history largely as a way to vent my own anger. As I got older it narrowed down to a more specific focus on individual violence. I'm just trying to understand where it came from.": "Caleb",
  "Most men's anger about religion is as if two men should quarrel for a lady they neither of them care for.": "Edward",
  "I don't think I could play a character that I couldn't relate to somehow. I'm not unfamiliar with frustration, anger, shame, helplessness and a load of other emotions that make up our psycho-soup. I try to focus on that frustration, that sense of unfairness, and multiply it.": "Terry",
  "Anger is one way to respond to fear. I say one way because responses are categorically multiple.": "Mark",
  "Man should forget his anger before he lies down to sleep.": "Thomas",
  "My hope is that out of all the anger and seeming hostility that we hear in some of today's music will come some sort of coalition that will become politically involved.": "Roberta",
  "It angers me that a timed, planned and paid smearing campaign is run against me in the press.": "Beny",
  "Efforts following 9/11 were important. They set a tone. They reminded those who might be tempted to take out their anger on an entire community that such actions were wrong.": "Alexander",
  "With Stacy, it was interesting because you know he was within all this chaos, all these different lives that were so broken and so much anger and so much frustration and their skating came out of that, their different styles came out of that.": "John",
  "An angry player can't argue with the back of an umpire who is walking away.": "Bill",
  "I'm really busted up over this and I'm very, very sorry to those people in the audience, the blacks, the Hispanics, whites - everyone that was there that took the brunt of that anger and hate and rage and how it came through.": "Michael",
  "Back in those early days when I began my apprenticeship as a poet, I also tried to voice our anger, spirit of defiance and resistance in a Jamaican poetic idiom.": "Linton",
  "Wherever there is injustice, there is anger, and anger is like gasoline - if you spray it around and somebody lights a matchstick, you have an inferno. But anger inside an engine is powerful: it can drive us forward and can get us through dreadful moments and give us power. I learnt this with my discussions with nuclear policy makers.": "Scilla",
  "Keep your temper. A decision made in anger is never sound.": "Ford",
  "I always tell people, anger is like liquid. It's fluid, it's like water. You put it in a container and it takes the shape of that container. So many people you see in prison, unleashing war on their people, they are angry, and they take their anger and put it into a violent container.": "Leymah",
  "For a long time I thought I could deal with my anger and hostility on my own. But I couldn't. I denied that it had affected me, and yet I was so frantic on the inside with other people: I needed to be constantly reassured.": "Kelly",
  "Verbally, I'm quite fast on my feet. I could embarrass or anger most people if I wanted to.": "Andrew",
  "The anger that appears to be building up between the sexes becomes more virulent with every day that passes. And far from women taking the blame... the fact is that men are invariably portrayed as the bad guys. Being a good man is like being a good Nazi.": "Dave",
  "The Eyemo was heavy and could be noisy. Once, I was in an auditorium filming a speech made by Goebbels when, suddenly, it decided to emit a huge snarling sound. Goebbels froze, and hundreds of uniformed Brownshirts turned and glared at me in anger. It was not a comfortable moment.": "Douglas",
  "When trying to start a company, your enemy isn't criticism, anger or insults. Your enemy is apathy.": "Gil",

  "Fear generates anger, and fear generates violence, and those were part of what built the Saudi state.": "Robert",
  "There's a reason why anger, fear, and hatred are paths to the dark side: they all spring from a single source - the same source as a certain flavor of love. A dangerously sweet, addictive flavor.": "Matthew",
  "Your anger is a gift.": "Zack",
  "The anger in the Brigade against those who fought the Republic in the rear was sharpened by reports of weapons, even tanks, being kept from the front and hidden for treacherous purposes.": "Bill",

  "I know I should feel anger at my father for certain things. But since he died when I was 11, I never got to that point.": "Nathaniel",
  "My father was my hero, and he died when I was 11. So, I really never experienced the kind of natural teenage rebellion or the anger at him. I never experienced those feelings as a young person.": "Nathaniel",
  "I personally do not believe in politics, hatred, or anger in my musical composition.": "Horace",
  "As a system of philosophy it is not like the Tower of Babel, so daring its high aim as to seek a shelter against God's anger; but it is like a pyramid poised on its apex.": "Adam",
  "Anger becomes limiting, restricting. You can't see through it. While anger is there, look at that, too. But after a while, you have to look at something else.": "Thylias",
  "The anger and the brutality against everything can readily from one hour to the next be transformed into its opposite.": "Thomas",
  "There's a difference between an outburst of spontaneous anger, which doesn't have a political objective, and a more measured response that we saw in the Occupy Wall Street movement.": "David",
  "Take care of your body. It's the only place you have to live.": "Jim",
  "Physical fitness is not only one of the most important keys to a healthy body, it is the basis of dynamic and creative intellectual activity.": "John",
  "Fitness is not about being better than someone else... It's about being better than you used to be.": "Khloe",
  "True enjoyment comes from activity of the mind and exercise of the body the two are ever united. ": "Wilhelm",
  "The mind is the most important part of achieving any fitness goal. Mental change always comes before physical change.": "Matt",
  "You need to put what you learn into practice and do it over and over again until it's a habit. I always say, 'Seeing is not believing. Doing is believing.' There is a lot to learn about fitness, nutrition and emotions, but once you do, you can master them instead of them mastering you.": "Brett",
  "Exercise to stimulate, not to annihilate. The world wasn't formed in a day, and neither were we. Set small goals and build upon them.": "Lee",
  "Swimming is normal for me. I'm relaxed. I'm comfortable, and I know my surroundings. It's my home.": "Michael",
  "Exercise should be regarded as tribute to the heart.": "Gene",
  "Number one, like yourself. Number two, you have to eat healthy. And number three, you've got to squeeze your buns. That's my formula.": "Richard",
  "Practice puts brains in your muscles.": "Sam",
  "Our growing softness, our increasing lack of physical fitness, is a menace to our security.": "John",
  "You can always improve your fitness if you keep training.": "Pastor",
  "I don't smoke, don't drink much, and go to the gym five times a week. I live a healthy lifestyle and feel great. I can run a marathon, you know.": "Sarah",
  "Fitness is important, but the most important thing is how you adapt and the way you feel physically. To adapt to a new position. To try to change your game.": "Fernando",
  "The value and utility of any experiment are determined by the fitness of the material to the purpose for which it is used, and thus in the case before us it cannot be immaterial what plants are subjected to experiment and in what manner such experiment is conducted.": "Gregor",
  "Resting for me is fitness training.": "Jenson",
  "Fitness needs to be perceived as fun and games or we subconsciously avoid it.": "Alan",
  "My wife and I work out together almost every day. It's just a great way to spend time together. We're going to run a marathon together later this year, and that's one more goal that we'll accomplish as husband and wife.": "Bill",
  "In my judgment, physical fitness is basic to all forms of excellence and to a strong, confident nation.": "Robert",
  "Sport is not just about entertainment. It is equally about winning and losing, pooling and galvanising the energy of the youth, upgrading people's physical fitness and mental prowess.": "Nita",
  "My fitness journey will be a lifelong journey.": "Khloe",
  "As a longtime practitioner of yoga and a person who's been involved in physical fitness my whole life, I can tell you, yoga helps you achieve altered states of consciousness. It is not just stretching. The only way you can say that it's stretching is if you haven't done it, or that you haven't done it rigorously for a long period of time.": "Joe",
  "Regularity in the hours of rising and retiring, perseverance in exercise, adaptation of dress to the variations of climate, simple and nutritious aliment, and temperance in all things are necessary branches of the regimen of health.": "Philip",
  "Exercise is the chief source of improvement in our faculties.": "Hugh",
  "I like exercise. I like a healthy body.": "Erin",
  "If it weren't for the fact that the TV set and the refrigerator are so far apart, some of us wouldn't get any exercise at all.": "Joey",
  "I attend to my fitness. I go the gym every day and try to maintain my physical fitness; without that, it is tough to take challenges on the chess board.": "Viswanathan",

  "You must also give mental and physical fitness priority.": "Jim",

  "I try and groom myself, be it through fitness or dance.": "Yami",
  "My weight fluctuates depending on my mood and my current devotion to my fitness routine.": "Lena",
  "Don't get hung up on the size. If you feel bad about yourself because a 12 is what fits, take a Sharpie, and write '6' on the label.": "Stacy",
  "It's so easy to lose your fitness and so hard to gain it back.": "Alex",
  "When the child begins to think and to make use of the written language to express his rudimentary thinking, he is ready for elementary work; and this fitness is a question not of age or other incidental circumstance but of mental maturity.": "Maria",
  "I don't lift weights. I do fitness exercises to stay strong.": "Chad",
  "The first time I see a jogger smiling, I'll consider it.": "Joan",
  "Exercise is labor without weariness.": "Samuel",
  "For exercise, I now run with my chocolate Lab puppy, Oscar.": "Daniela",
  "I would rather exercise than read a newspaper.": "Kim",
  "Like most people I can be lazy, so it's nice to have a goal or deadline or reason to work out. I feel better when I get to exercise, or when I'm outdoors. I like to hike, swim and run, and I love to play soccer.": "Viggo",
  "I didn't have the same fitness or ability as the other girls, so I had to beat them with my mind.": "Martina",
  "I think it's more important to be fit so that you can be healthy and enjoy activities than it is to have a good body.": "Rachel",
  "It's challenging, but you have to at least try to eat right and exercise.": "Joely",
  "You can't get rid of it with exercise alone. You can do the most vigorous exercise and only burn up 300 calories in an hour. If you've got fat on your body, the exercise firms and tones the muscles. But when you use that tape measure, what makes it bigger? It's the fat!": "Jack",
  "I love to swim for miles I could just go back and forth. ": "Jill",
  "What's important is to get into shape and then not to have to worry about it. I don't want to get on stage and not being able to do something. Not being physically fit doesn't work for me.": "Chris",
  "My job is to be fit and I'm really blessed that I get to go and work out and live a really healthy lifestyle.": "Kerri",
  "Fitness is not an option. It's part of my job.": "Alison",
  "No one ceases to be a man, no one forfeits his rights to civilization merely by being more or less uncultured, and since the Filipino is regarded as a fit citizen when he is asked to pay taxes or shed his blood to defend the fatherland, why must this fitness be denied him when the question arises of granting him some right?": "Jose",
  "I love fitness, yoga. I love fashion. On the weekends, I try to relax. I have pretty crazy weeks. I like spas and nice dinners. I'm not much of a club person. I like to hang on the beach in Malibu.": "Charlotte",
  "You can be in excellent physical shape, with low cholesterol, a healthy body weight and good overall physical fitness - but that doesn't necessarily mean you're healthy.": "Michael",
  "The spirit of the Olympic movement is great for young people because it teaches them about the training and discipline required to compete. Even if they don't make the teams, they can rededicate their lives to the art of sport, discipline, and physical fitness.": "Richard",
  "I suffer panic attacks which has made me really conscious about my fitness and I have become addicted to jogging. It might sound odd but a lot of good has come out of it. My fans send letters saying they have taken up jogging because I do it.": "Ellie",
  "Fitness is a luxury when you are busy!": "Lauren",
  "Never, ever exercise in front of a TV or while reading. You lose 50 percent of the benefit of the exercise by not hearing and feeling your heart rate, your sweat and the pain levels that need to be encountered in fitness training.": "Kevin",
  "If you ask me about my success story, the secret is I know when to pull myself back. I don't overexpose myself; I give proper gaps whenever I can. I do not over spend myself, I keep myself busy in lot of activities. I really work hard; I work harder than others, by focussing on my fitness level and studying music.": "Sonu",
  "I am pleased with the fitness that I have.": "Lin",
  "My own preferred fitness regime is to use my bicycle.": "Paul",
  "Fitness, defending, the mental stuff - those were all weaknesses of mine. And I turned those into strengths.": "Carli",
  "I do a lot of biking. I need that mileage and the long-distance stuff because tennis demands it. My fitness trainer is always trying to convince me to do an Ironman. I can probably run the marathon, I can make the 112 miles on the bike, but I will never swim for 2.4 miles. I will die after 100 meters.": "Tomas",
  "It takes about four days of virtuous living to create a little weight loss. That also happens to be the time required to get used to eating less. In other words, if you can get past day three of a fitness regimen, things improve.": "Martha",
  "I'm quite into fitness, and I have a fantastic personal trainer who knows me, knows my body, knows when to push me, and knows when not to push me. She doesn't make me do 20 burpees in a row and instead focuses on strengthening my core, telling me we need to focus on making me into 'a tall giraffe'!": "Poppy",
  "Teaching kids about health and fitness is important to me. It's about being fit for life.": "Jackie",
  "People need to have clear goals about why they are exercising, and they should consult a fitness expert to find out what kind of exercise is suitable.": "Lynn",
  "For me, triathlons were something that was down to me and my fitness. Now, I really enjoy the pain in the triathlon of chasing someone down. It's a bit like chasing down Nico Rosberg in the last few laps at Silverstone - it makes you feel alive.": "Jenson",
  "If someone thinks, 'I'll spend the off season working on my fitness and I'll come back a better cricketer,' I don't think that's enough. You need to spend a lot of time working on your skills and honing your skills.": "Rahul",
  "I try to come at fitness and nutrition from a perspective of gentleness and what will make me feel good afterwards. I try to stay out of the mindset of needing to fix myself. I do whatever seems fun to me.": "Taylor",
  "Muscles come and go flab lasts. ": "Bill",
  "I recommend that people try new stuff or take new fitness classes all the time. It's important to mix up your routine, not only for your body, but also for your mental state.": "Alison",
  "I think if you exercise, your state of mind - my state of mind - is usually more at ease, ready for more mental challenges. Once I get the physical stuff out of the way it always seems like I have more calmness and better self-esteem.": "Stone",
  "Training is such a vital part of preparation for a game, you really do train to play. It tops up your ability, like sharpening a carving knife. You can get away with not doing it for a while, as long as you have reached a certain standard of fitness.": "Graeme",
  "Oh, and once, when I was in the Marines, I got a perfect score on my physical fitness test.": "Drew",
  "My Daddy liked physical fitness and wanted me to be a prizefighter.": "Judy",
  "Cycling keeps me lean and I need to stay in shape, especially as I still like eating chocolate and ice-cream! I like to go mountain biking too. Running is also good; it's what we were designed to do as humans, so it comes naturally.": "Mark",
  "I would like to thank everyone who supported me to be fit for the Euros. I had some fitness problems before the tournament, but I am here now!": "Andriy",
  "Fitness has always been one of the top priorities in my life because that's the way I grew up, with soccer being the sport of choice.": "Ziggy",
  "Our children are obese, either have or being threatened by diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and not socially adjusting properly to others because of a lack of fitness.": "Richard",
  "I can jog, but I can't run. That's hard for me. I like the fact that I can jog for fitness, but to me there's a huge difference between jogging and running.": "Mary",
  "For years, I always thought it was hilarious that I was this fitness guru, because fitness was just a tool I utilized to help people improve their confidence. For me, it's never been about fitness. It's always been about helping to empower people.": "Jillian",
  "A drunkard in the gutter is just where he ought to be, according to the fitness and tendency of things. Nature has set upon him the process of decline and dissolution by which she removes things which have survived their usefulness.": "William",

  "Exercise is done against one's wishes and maintained only because the alternative is worse.": "George",
  "I wanted to get really fit. I wanted to lose some weight. So I've been doing Pilates and yoga, trying to lean out my body so I won't be bulky.": "Serena",
  "What's wrong with extreme dieting and hard-core fitness plans is that they don't take into account the rest of your life.": "Alison",
  "When you're singing, you're using extra muscles, and it requires a lot of exercise and breathing. You can't do that if you're a sissy. If I have any fitness advice for people, I'd tell them to sing more. It's good therapy, too.": "Willie",
  "Doing nothing would stress me out. So I am still pretty much active practicing judo with my friends, who are former judo athletes, to maintain our fitness as well as the friendships among us. In my spare time, I usually go jogging around the Gelora Bung Karno stadium or head to the gym.": "Joe",
  "People assume that you need to run fast to get to optimum fitness, but the truth is endurance lifting makes you stronger and leaner.": "Greg",
  "I would say 90 percent of the stuff we do is technical anyway. If you look at a two-hour training day, 12 minutes are probably spent running or gaining fitness.": "Ashton",
  "Mental fitness is served by consciously redirecting our attention away from the constant bombardment from the media whose reason to be seems to be focused on keeping us in a state of constant alert.": "David",
  "In my view, fitness training isn't that important in England, as they all train with such intensity anyway and have a competitive edge when just sprinting. The matches are all hard-fought, too.": "Claudio",
  "I do yoga, I do Bikram and I run, and I eat really healthy.": "Lady",
  "One of the things I've always enjoyed is moving around and staying fit. Physicality is such a big part of being an actor, but it's also about stillness and silence.": "Joel",
  "Being a dancer is my metaphor for life because you have to know your body. Being a dancer and paying attention to fitness is all about moving in balance.": "Goldie",
  "Just as you can't blindly follow fashion, you can't follow fitness, either.": "Anushka",
  "I'm not a fitness model; I'm just a singer. If people focus on that, that's what I care about.": "Alessia",
  "I've been into exercise my whole life, been a runner and been into health and fitness always.": "Sissy",
  "I tell my sons all the time, 'The most important thing in your life is fitness,' but a lot of fighters go overboard.": "George",
  "I created a fitness club with five friends. We have weekly check-ins and a reward system - and group penalties if one of us slacks off.": "Bryce",
  "There is a moment when you get older when your metabolism slows down and you don't feel like working out any more, so you don't want to keep yourself fit any more, but that's your decision. Why should you be judged for it?": "Janet",
  "I say, 'Use it or lose it.' I have my own fitness regime, which is centred around stretching, free-weights and fast walking. I also have a trainer half of the year, as I spend my summers in the south of France where I swim a lot.": "Joan",
  "My assumption was that people are already motivated to go to a fitness class. That's who I am. I was already ready to go out there and get to class. All I needed was a search tool. But it turns out people need more than that, and that's why gym memberships exist.": "Payal",
  "Some people have that school of thought where fitness isn't enjoyable, but we're making it enjoyable, I think, by making it more fun, challenging, and engaging rather than this boring thing that you have to do. It's about using technology and data to change this experience.": "Payal",
  "The manager and the fitness staff condition every training session. They plan it out week by week on what players need. If players need a rest, they will do that; if players need to work hard, they will do that as well.": "Harry",
  "We've all tried to bunk our gym session or dance class. A single routine can get monotonous. That's why I have decided to make my fitness regime fun by incorporating different workouts into my schedule. From dancing to yoga, I plan to keep it as interesting as possible so I'm never bored of working out.": "Disha",
  "I understand only three things - films, fitness, and food.": "Rakul",
  "For fitness, I've just bought a watch which keeps a track of how many calories I burn, what's my heart rate, which is very fascinating.": "Yami",
  "All we're trying to do is change how people think about fitness. And build Under Armour into the biggest brand in the entire land.": "Kevin",
  "For a while after college, I was thinking of becoming a fitness trainer, and I am a certified aqua trainer.": "Dylan",
  "When you get into the final week of the Tour de France, it becomes a different kind of race. As the distance and the fatigue really tell, that is when it becomes a proper test of everyone's fitness.": "Bradley",
  "I can work hard and be disciplined like a soldier, but I could never reach their level of fitness.": "Richard",
  "I try to keep at a non-obsessive level of fitness. It's not about looking great, it's about just feeling good. So I do a lot of yoga. Bikram just blows my mind. It's mental as well as physical; if I don't train, I get very depressed.": "Richard",
  "It's not like I was trying to be sexy but I had to get fit because I had to be able to do stunts. Also I wanted that, if Bond took his clothes off, he looked like a man who did what he did, which was kill people for a living. I thought the only way to do that was to work out and get fit and buff and get physically into shape.": "Daniel",
  "When I was back to 100 per cent fitness, I was able to show what I was capable of. I like to think I will bring a freshness into the Euros, and now that I am captain, I am going to do my best to take responsibility.": "Eden",

  "In the British Special Air Service, combat fitness is all about running.": "Bear",
  "I never stop working when I'm on stage, and that's my fitness.": "Jessie",
  "At my first Olympics, I didn't have a contract, and I wasn't making any money. After my first Olympics, I was working at 24 Hour Fitness at the front desk. I would go to practice in the morning, run home, shower, grab some food and then go straight to work. I didn't get off of work until 10 or 11 o'clock at night.": "Michelle",
  "I'm French, so I'm quite lazy about exercising, and I smoke. But I do love going for a run in the morning with my dog. That's all.": "Eva",
  "I took up boxing as a fitness thing. I got obsessed, and I would go every day when I wasn't working. It's just an insane sport when you get into it.": "Lena",
  "For most athletes, there's a focus on your own fitness, but I have to rely on my horse, too. I've been very lucky so far, and it hasn't presented a problem, but you can never count on a competition going as planned until you're there and actually doing it.": "Charlotte",
  "I'm not a waif-y girl and never will be. I think it's healthy when fitness experts encourage fitness rather than getting a certain body shape.": "Sophia",
  "As Mick Jagger will tell you, performing is an aerobic work-out. I've got the bass guitar, which is the heaviest of all the instruments, and I'm a little girl, in boiling-hot leather under the lights. You have to keep the fitness level up if you want to look good up there.": "Suzi",
  "For much of the year, you're just trying to maintain your fitness. It's not often you get a lot of time to really concentrate on improving it.": "Andy",
  "My fitness trainer's English, my physio's English, some of my friends are English. I don't have a problem with English people at all.": "Andy",
  "Staying more controlled mentally stemmed from taking my fitness more seriously. When you're doing track work, sprints and so on, it's pretty painful, but that does make you feel better prepared and therefore mentally stronger when you're going into a match. You know, without a doubt, that you are strong enough to last.": "Andy",
  "Early in my career, I got roles that demanded that I be fit to carry off the angry young man look. Of course, I'm a fitness freak, and that's something I picked up from my dad.": "Akkineni",
  "While I try to keep my fitness regimen consistent, during awards season, I'm especially conscious of what I'll be wearing and plan my workouts accordingly.": "Kate",
  "I'm doing four hours of gymnastics training a day, six days a week and then an extra two to three hours in a fitness center as well.": "Shawn",
  "I haven't always been into fitness. But I noticed that when I'd be on stage playing a show, I could hardly make it through the fifth song without having to take a breather.": "Thomas",
  "We talk a lot on 'Biggest Loser' about how fitness is a natural antidepressant, how it burns off stress. What I like about running is that it gives me time alone. I'm always busy, with people at work, with my kids. I love getting out for a run by myself and just listening to my music.": "Alison",
  "I have been through various fitness regimes. I used to run about five miles a day and I did aerobics for a while.": "Sting",
  "Virat Kohli has so far shown that he has more ability and talent than anybody else, and if he can play till 32 or 34 with same fitness and without injuries, he will come to a point where not even Vivian Richards neither Sachin Tendulkar had such a record.": "Kapil",
  "Obviously, your family life is the priority, but there's still other stuff you have to get done in a day. I think the way I make it work is by taking care of myself, and that includes fitness and eating right and all those things, but also by being very organized and punctual.": "Cindy",
  "I think when you come to Australia you immediately get the sense of fitness and taking care of yourself and being healthy, and it really shows.": "Tinie",
  "I go to the gym every day. That tends to taper off when I'm at a tournament. During tournaments, I'm not trying to build fitness. I'm simply trying to keep away any kind of tension. I go for long walks to clear my head.": "Viswanathan",
  "Even though I'm not a competitive athlete, I have to still maintain things and try to keep myself fit because I am at that age where I need to make sure to get those regular checkups and make sure everything is in tact.": "Jackie",
  "To hear both critics and defenders talk about the fitness of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Supreme Court, you'd think the most successful Supreme Court justices had been warm, collegial consensus-builders. But history tells a different story.": "Noah",
  "Too much redesign has to do more with fad and fashion than with fitness and function. It is change for the sake of change. Such redesign is not only unnecessary, it is all too often also retrogressive, leading to things that work less effectively than those they were designed to replace.": "Henry",
  "Imagine how many women could excel in science if not for the pernicious myth that science and math are a man's game. Likewise, fitness isn't defined by the Arnold Schwarzeneggers of the world.": "Kyle",
  "Faith can make no appeal to reason or the fitness of things; its appeal is to the Word of God, and whatever is therein revealed, faith accepts as true.": "Edward",
  "I can't eat whatever I want, definitely not. I'm always controlled because I do a lot of fitness and triathlons, not just Formula One, so I always make sure I eat the right things.": "Jenson",
  "As the proud father of two teens and past Chairman to the Presidents Council on Physical Fitness and Sports, I am committed to educating parents and especially young people on ways to live a long, healthy and active life.": "Lee",
  "When I was 10, I asked my parents for a set of weights. I had my Charles Atlas book to go along with that. Every time we went to the grocery store, I'd rush to the magazine area and read the ones with Arnold Schwarzenegger and all those guys on the covers: 'Pumping Iron,' 'Muscle and Fitness,' 'Muscle Builder by Joe Weider.'": "Lee",
  "Because I take care of my body, it doesn't look like the body of a woman of my years.": "Gloria",
  "I have a pretty active presence on social networking sites, and every day there are messages from so many young girls telling me that they are happy B-Town has curvy women like me. I feel you should be happy the way you are. Of course, fitness is important, but not to the extent of obsession!": "Sonakshi",
  "Find fitness with fun dancing. It is fun and makes you forget about the dreaded exercise.": "Paula",
  "With fitness, I do Bikrams hot yoga. The gym that I have in my building is amazing. I love to do cardio and weights there.": "Shay",
  "Kids are starting at such a low base rate in terms of fitness that it's taking them years to catch up to where people like me started from. Every little bit is making it more difficult for kids to succeed on a world stage.": "Daley",
  "I've still got a small fitness and conditioning business where I travel round the world doing stuff for individuals and corporations, mainly fitness training.": "Daley",
  "The only weights I lift are my dogs.": "Olivia",
  "I am 5 ft 6 in, and at my peak, my vital statistics were 37-22-35. I didn't even think about my weight - but now I work hard at keeping healthy. Fortunately, my husband Richie is as much of a fitness buff as I am.": "Raquel",
  "Bathrooms are, on a square foot basis, the most expensive room in the house to renovate. If you want to test your heart's fitness, try shopping for simple bathroom faucets. Add in the cost of the required valves, mixers and trims, and you may need reviving when you see the tally!": "Candice",
  "Almost 70 per cent of your fitness battle is won the day you realise what your body needs and when. I've made my own diets, and I decide for myself what works for me.": "Arjun",
  "I look at fitness as a necessity in the same way as how you drink water, eat food, one should look at fitness in a dedicated way. People will look fresh and happy. If you are happy, you in a way look fit.": "Arjun",
  "Fitness is defined differently by everyone, but for me, the most important thing is being healthy. As tennis players, what we do is not the healthiest thing. We almost abuse our bodies.": "Sania",
  "Let's face it: fitness is boring. But it's critical to be extremely dedicated to whatever you decide to take up to achieve a desired result. There's no way you are going to get there without dedication, which is the key for me.": "Harbhajan",
  "I believe it's extremely important to include some other type of fitness activity in your training, so cross training will help you to avoid injury when you are dancing.": "Laurieann",
  "I personally love to run outdoor fitness trails. I love the meditative value I get when out alone, challenging myself to run faster and higher.": "Laurieann",
  "At times, you are mentally but not physically prepared; at times, you are physically but not mentally prepared. I would be lying if I said it doesn't affect your performance. But the sooner you get over it, the better. So you discipline yourself. That is why fitness counts.": "Mohammad",
  "Obviously, when you're doing fitness work at a club all week and every week, it's all about specific drills for what you need to do on the pitch. So I'd be doing a different drill to the centre-midfielders. It's all specifically tailored for me. For example, my drills are high speed. It's all about trying to break the line with a sharp sprint.": "Jamie",
  "Fitness has always been one of my strengths. I can do all the long-distance runs. When I was at school and we entered the competitions, I used to do the 100m, 200m, and the 1500m as well, so it's never just been a pace thing.": "Jamie",
  "My bottom is so big it's got its own gravitational field.": "Carol",
  "I might do a fitness video. Actually, more of a fatness video.": "Sanjeev",
  "With both kids, I started working out again at 16 days postpartum, but I treated myself with kindness, doing mild workouts, because my fitness level was lower.": "Gabrielle",
  "My church has a health and fitness ministry to encourage our members to take care of spiritually and physically how could I not? ": "Marvin",
  "People may say I developed an iron will, but what really happened is that I made myself much fitter. I think an iron will is always supported by fitness.": "Ivan",
  "I'm enjoying myself this year and for once I'm not chasing my fitness.": "Jamie",
  "I'm 33 now and I seem to have hit a fitness plane. Shifting the wobbly bits isn't as easy as it used to be.": "Matthew",
  "Sometimes fitness is a good thing to have, but you have to recognise that fitness takes you only so far, and skills are the most important thing. Fitness just helps you execute those cricketing skills for longer and more consistently, maybe.": "Rahul",
  "The bowlers I respected or feared or rated were not the ones who gave me lip or stared at me or abused me. More the ones who, at any stage of the game, when had they had the ball in hand, they were going to be at me, and they were going to have the skill and the fitness and the ability to be aggressive.": "Rahul",
  "I eat super healthy and I'm super fit. I dabble in every type of fitness. I have a trainer and I go to the gym. I do yoga as well.": "Linda",
  "Overall, I think I'm in pretty good shape, but I'm not really someone that is gung-ho or a fitness fanatic.": "Cobi",
  "I am concentrating on my fitness levels so that I don't look old.": "Sonu",
  "I'm very active when I'm not pregnant, but I think fitness should be a natural part of your life, not something you have to force yourself to do.": "Jessica",
  "I try and maintain a little bit of fitness, man.": "Frank",
  "I have a tremendous passion for fitness, I love challenges and I am a very driven guy.": "Lou",
  "The public character of every public servant is legitimate subject of discussion, and his fitness or unfitness for office may be fairly canvassed by any person.": "Charles",
  "I know some people who are like, 'I love fitness,' and I feel like if you have to say that, you're still in the romance stage. I'm in the stage where I've been married to it for 60 years, and I don't think I'll ever get a divorce.": "Matt",
  "Our regular fitness programme means that the race lasting longer than others should not be a problem, but something you have to prepare for in Singapore is ensuring you always keep well-hydrated, as the heat and humidity can easily dehydrate you.": "Romain",
  "They both go together you can't be in front of the camera hosting a fitness television show in front of 75 million households and not have trained 6 days per week year round - in a bikini no less. ": "Kiana",
  "Fitness of a top-class squash player is very important, and talent only can't do the job. They have to get training regularly for at least eight hours a day so that they could put some good show in a two-hour match.": "Jahangir",
  "It's better to train for 4-5 hours a week than to do ten hours one week then nothing for two weeks. It helps your body adapt and also maintains your fitness.": "Alistair",
  "I think I have just evolved as a person, as a human being. I like fitness. It's an important part of my everyday life, and I enjoy and endorse a healthy lifestyle.": "Karisma",
  "When I left EastEnders, I could have earned an absolute fortune from sexy calendars, shoots for lads' mags, fitness videos and reality shows. But I always turned them down.": "Michelle",
  "I thought I did well for someone who has been out for 10 or 11 months. Then I was sub against Liverpool and tried to play for the guys and work on my fitness.": "Paul",
  "The goodness of a thing created is the perfection of its fitness for the use which it serves. Now that use is either particular or universal.": "William",
  "On my days off, I like to be outdoors - on my bike or walking the dog or swimming - so it's important anyone I date is also into fitness.": "Mollie",
  "A year ago I had a back injury and followed a good nutrition program to help speed up my recovery. I focused on exercise and staying healthy in order to get back out on the ice.": "Sasha",
  "When I do get time, I like to hike and I take lots of vitamins and powders to keep healthy.": "Catherine",
  "Once you are over 30, 35 years old, I think everyone should get down to the gym and start moving again.": "Warren",
  "The health industry, the fitness industry, was really starting to pick up. This was around the mid 80's.": "Warren",
  "I do a one-hour workout called Drenched, a cardio-boxing fitness routine, Monday through Friday. There are usually between twenty-five and fifty people there - everyone from stay-at-home moms and professional martial artists to teenagers and seniors. They play great dance music. When I can, I take two classes back-to-back.": "Carrie",
  "I'm freakishly competitive, so I set a date to achieve a certain weight or fitness.": "Jamie",
  "I have been particularly struck with the overwhelming evidence which is given as to the fitness of the natives of India for high offices and employments.": "Richard",
  "I had something to prove and went in the studio and started writing. I got into fitness and style and learned the whole craft. That was when I wrote everything on the album. I put out 'Don't Ya,' and it took off.": "Brett",
  "I train Monday through Saturday. I usually have fitness training for 90 minutes, then I'm on the tennis court for 3 to 4 hours.": "Sloane",
  "Beside the brand-ambassador elements of the modern racing driver, the evolution of the athlete has mandated that as drivers, we are very committed to fitness.": "Charlie",
  "I think a basic level of fitness can help the body cope with all manner of incidents.": "Richard",
  "I don't want to lose my fitness. I'm 45. I have two babies. I've got a long way to go and I want to keep in tiptop shape. There's no magic bullet.": "Marcia",
  "You can control what you put in your body - 100 percent. You really can control your level of fitness and how your body looks.": "Sara",
  "I always knew I'd keep at it with the plodding doggedness that I used to master lump-less gravy and wriggle out of fitness classes; I always knew I'd get a zillion rejection slips. I figured I'd write part time while working various full-time office jobs, and maybe, maybe in my 50s, I'd be able to quit and try writing full time.": "MaryJanice",
  "I love to sing. I also had a band during my college days in Saudi Arabia called Thousand Decibels. If not an actor, I would have become a singer. I am very passionate about work. I am a fitness freak: I go to gym before doing my shoot. I also do yoga.": "Karan",
  "I grew up watching Salman Khan and Arnold Schwarzenegger, who have always juggled fitness with acting. In real life, I'm a fitness freak. Besides, it is nice to look at an actor who is fit, and if you become a role model, that's a perk.": "Karan",
  "It's been a long road back to health and fitness for me. I am just glad to have been given the opportunity to do what I love most.": "Jonah",
  "Once in a while I'll get moved to do some exercise. It's something I long for but the biggest problem is bending down and putting my tennis shoes on. Once I go out I'm OK.": "David",
  "Fitness is a curve. You can be Lance Armstrong, or you can be really out of shape at the opposite end. People enter the curve wherever they are and then they can move up the curve, by better nutrition and better exercise.": "Gordon",
  "What you want is to rev up your metabolism so that you are burning fat and calories, not preserving fat and calories.": "Kathy",
  "Beauty connotes humanity. We call a natural object beautiful because we see that its form expresses fitness, the perfect fulfillment of function.": "Moshe",
  "We've got to get people out of their cars, out of those drive-thru windows, get them walking, get them in parks and get them more active.": "Mick",
  "For guys who are into fitness, I think it's important to wear slim-fit stuff that is pretty tight so they can show off the bodies they have been working hard to have. Women are going to appreciate that.": "Carl",
  "I have run two Olympic 'A' standard times over the past 12 months and with the time I ran at the African Championships last week I know my speed and fitness are constantly improving so that I will peak in time for the Olympics.": "Oscar",
  "It's not about weight, it's about fitness, and one component of being fit is to have relatively low body fat, because fat is not very efficient, whereas muscle is.": "Deborah",
  "I'm really into fitness, so my hobbies are yoga, Pilates, and working out.": "Charlotte",
  "It's very important to have the right clothing to exercise in. If you throw on an old T-shirt or sweats, it's not inspiring for your workout.": "Cheryl",
  "I have found a flat on Merseyside and am settling down here. If I can keep playing and get back to full match fitness, I know I have a lot to offer still.": "David",
  "Dance never really goes away; it just reforms and reinvents, and it's become more athletic with new connection to fitness and sport. Dance used to have this exclusivity, but not any more.": "Bonnie",
  "I just have to express myself somehow, either through singing, dance or fitness. You get sick of it; you have days where you think you don't want to do it, but generally after I've done something, I feel better. That's why I do the exercise: to earn my bar of chocolate and cappuccino.": "Bonnie",
  "Every morning, I eat one fat-free yogurt with a sliced peach when peaches are in season, and one thin slice of whole-wheat bread. The same thing. I don't want to get fat. And I want to keep my fitness.": "Leonard",
  "You need to eat normally and healthfully, and you need to exercise. I'm so passionate about this because I think people spend their lives not happy in their bodies.": "Courtney",
  "For a good workout, I go to At One Fitness in North Hollywood, where my trainer, Jon Allsop, puts me through it all. I like it because it's a small gym and I've known the people for a long time. Jon will have me do cross-training where I'll lift weights, jump rope, throw around a medicine ball and I never get to stop.": "Tim",
  "I keep up with everything in terms of health, fitness, nutrition, skin care, hair, nails. Really, everything. I'm an avid reader of every women's health newsletter from every hospital in the country.": "Evelyn",
  "I became a fitness fiend when I was about 17 or 18.": "Cynthia",
  "Personally, I need a high level of physical fitness in order to feel at ease.": "Jurgen",
  "I've had one very bad ankle injury but otherwise I've been incredibly lucky with my fitness. I've worked hard at it and I've always been fit even compared to other players. That sustains you through various parts of your career, but I am 36.": "Graeme",
  "I'm healthy now. I probably wouldn't say I'm at my best fitness level and I haven't played that much lately, but I'm healthy and that's all that matters.": "Mary",
  "The only way for a rich man to be healthy is by exercise and abstinence, to live as if he were poor.": "William",
  "So I've broadened the fitness concept to make it one of moderation and balance.": "Kenneth",
  "Now I say that if you run more than 15 miles a week, it's for something other than aerobic fitness. Once you pass 15 miles, you do not see much further improvement.": "Kenneth",
  "You gotta have a body.": "Jayne",
  "I've published one book before, and now I'm writing a book of essays and stories about life in Tokyo. And I have one book coming out in May in Germany, about fitness.": "Franka",
  "I decided to write 'True Refuge' during a major dive in my own health. Diagnosed with a genetic disease that affected my mobility, I faced tremendous fear and grief about losing the fitness and physical freedom I loved.": "Tara",
  "I'm still very professional about my fitness. I stay in trim as I always did.": "Peter",
  "There are similarities between business and sport, in the pressures involved and in the fitness aspect too.": "Peter",
  "Yoga's an amazing release.": "Monica",
  "I enjoy going to the Y. I take all the fitness classes that my dad takes; that's sort of our bonding - anything athletic, anything sports related.": "Alyson",
  "I have always maintained a high level of fitness, and that is why I am still able to handle the demands of playing in the Premiership. People have always commented on my fitness, and it's something I pride myself on.": "Richard",
  "I was a bit worried coming back to the Premiership from America, but I have been pleased with my form, and the interest I have received has been good for my ego. I have no worries about my fitness, and I am really looking forward to the season starting now.": "Richard",
  "Fitness will be a major factor in the first race and I think that will play into the hands of drivers who have been racing recently, rather than people like me who haven't raced properly for a decade. I'am not one of the favourites to start with.": "Nigel",
  "I'm an athlete, so I can get up one day and run and it wouldn't bother me. I don't get the time because I work for long hours every day. Being constantly on the move itself helps me stay fit. I don't go to a gym. I use the stairs, not the lift. I'm not into fitness, but I feel I should start, as it's healthy.": "Genelia",
  "Ultimately, I'm in the fitness industry. But, I've branched out from there quite a bit. I began doing consulting on writing and getting published in magazines in about 2011. Right around that time, I started doing some angel investing and looking to grow my skills and general experience outside of that.": "John",
  "I think that our culture is doing something to women - let's say women in their late 30s and 40s and probably even 50s, - where they really are expected to keep this insane level of fitness and youth. I find that just a real waste of women's lives. I really do think that.": "Sarah",
  "With fitness, I decided that I wanted to get into shape, and my passion for fitness and a desire to help other people do the same made me decide to do a fitness video. People always tell me they want to work out to my songs, so why not make a fitness DVD.": "CeCe",
  "I am not a fitness freak, but I do my regular exercises.": "Uday",
  "Football shape is one thing, and then 'futbol' shape is a completely other thing. It's a whole other level of fitness that you have to work to maintain.": "Gabriel",
  "Linguistics is a good way of defining the culture of a brand. The vocabulary used by sports and lifestyle brands - running, fitness, training, motorsports - is all about functionality, whereas the vocabulary of the luxury business - handbags, ready-to-wear - is all about the product.": "Francois-Henri",
  "I am about to get involved with the biggest cancer hospital in Norway. They are building a fitness center to work with patients. I will be a consultant.": "Grete",
  "My mom was a professional fitness competitor, so I go into the gym with her. I train with my dad and mother. It's embarrassing, because she's really strong.": "Booboo",
  "The main thing is that it's nice to see these young people - 9 to 14 years old - take the opportunity to get more involved in their health and fitness. We need more kids to be more active.": "Rafer",
  "I also meet with city officials, representatives from governors' offices, really anyone in that sort of position who has shown an interest in youth fitness, to let them know why this sort of program is so important. I give the same message when I speak at conferences.": "Rafer",
  "Shearer could be at 100 per cent fitness, but not peak fitness.": "Graham",
  "At least for soccer players, it comes down to a blend of two types of fitness - your base endurance, which comes from longer distance running, and your speed, which comes from sprint-based workouts.": "Heather",
  "My fitness is good. I hope to improve it even further during training.": "Andriy",
  "When I'm on the road, I'll break my exercise into a cardio session and a weights session.": "Robert",
  "The fitness builds the foundation for me as an actor to have clarity. Fitness has always been the base of where I start off as a performer.": "Manu",
  "Don't get me wrong, I think bikes are terrific. I own several of my own, including a trendy mountain style, and ride them for pleasure and light exercise.": "Brock",
  "My husband and I own a CrossFit Gym. Crossfit is perfect for me because it's always competitive, all the workouts are in a class environment, and it's different every day. It's a constantly varied functional fitness workout done with intensity.": "Chelan",
  "I don't do very well with extremes of any kind - extreme diets, extreme fitness - so moderation makes a lot of sense, and Hershey's has really great portion-friendly desserts to help people incorporate treats into their lifestyles so they don't feel like they're depriving themselves and are still living a balanced life.": "Kimberly",
  "I'm such a fitness freak that I eat so plain, it's gross. I have oatmeal in the morning and then I have chicken breasts and vegetables and spinach shakes.": "Jake",
  "It is such a great opportunity to be the face of a brand which I remember wearing as a little kid and running around in half-naked. Bonds is now getting very serious about fitness, and their range is amazing. It's beautiful and comfy.": "Courtney",
  "15 minutes a day! Give me just this and I'll prove I can make you a new man.": "Charles",
  "I concentrate on exercises from the waist down, since that is the laziest part of a woman's body.": "Tina",
  "I love Nautilus and stretching. The results are immediate, and that gives me the motivation to continue.": "Donna",
  "One of my assets is my fitness. My fitness around the net and my movement: that's my defense to the power.": "Cara",
  "I remember Simon O'Donnell being struck with cancer during Australia's 1987 World Cup campaign. I know very well what it is like to have a teammate who has been struck with a potentially fatal disease. He fought through: managed to get himself back to 100% fitness and back to playing again.": "Tom",

  "Change before you have to.": "Jack",
  "Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has.": "Margaret",

  "Since we cannot change reality, let us change the eyes which see reality.": "Nikos",
  "Growth is painful. Change is painful. But, nothing is as painful as staying stuck where you do not belong.": "N.",
  "To improve is to change to be perfect is to change often. ": "Winston",
  "Times and conditions change so rapidly that we must keep our aim constantly focused on the future.": "Walt",
  "When we are no longer able to change a situation - we are challenged to change ourselves.": "Viktor",
  "I'm saying to be a hero is means you step across the line and are willing to make a sacrifice, so heroes always are making a sacrifice. Heroes always take a risk. Heroes always deviant. Heroes always doing something that most people don't and we want to change - I want to democratise heroism to say any of us can be a hero.": "Philip",
  "If you change the way you look at things, the things you look at change.": "Wayne",
  "The first step toward change is awareness. The second step is acceptance.": "Nathaniel",

  "If you do not change direction, you may end up where you are heading.": "Lao",
  "Some people don't like change, but you need to embrace change if the alternative is disaster.": "Elon",
  "The most important thing about global warming is this. Whether humans are responsible for the bulk of climate change is going to be left to the scientists, but it's all of our responsibility to leave this planet in better shape for the future generations than we found it.": "Mike",
  "Capitalism does not permit an even flow of economic resources. With this system, a small privileged few are rich beyond conscience, and almost all others are doomed to be poor at some level. That's the way the system works. And since we know that the system will not change the rules, we are going to have to change the system.": "Martin",
  "Empathy is the starting point for creating a community and taking action. It's the impetus for creating change.": "Max",
  "Your surroundings may change but your essence and your personality pretty much stay the same.": "Jenna",
  "You can't change who you are, but you can change what you have in your head, you can refresh what you're thinking about, you can put some fresh air in your brain.": "Ernesto",
  "I change my style maybe every month. I'm, like, punk one month, ghetto fab the next, classy the next. I'm just young and finding out who I am.": "Kylie",

  "Never believe that a few caring people can't change the world. For, indeed, that's all who ever have.": "Margaret",
  "The 'self-image' is the key to human personality and human behavior. Change the self image and you change the personality and the behavior.": "Maxwell",
  "Failed plans should not be interpreted as a failed vision. Visions don't change, they are only refined. Plans rarely stay the same, and are scrapped or adjusted as needed. Be stubborn about the vision, but flexible with your plan.": "John",
  "When the seasons shift, even the subtle beginning, the scent of a promised change, I feel something stir inside me. Hopefulness? Gratitude? Openness? Whatever it is, it's welcome.": "Kristin",

  "This stand wasn't because I feel like I'm being put down in any kind of way. This is because I'm seeing things happen to people that don't have a voice: people that don't have a platform to talk and have their voices heard and affect change. So I'm in the position where I can do that, and I'm going to do that for people that can't.": "Colin",

  "Vengeance is not the point change is. But the trouble is that in most people's minds the thought of victory and the thought of punishing the enemy coincide. ": "Barbara",
  "The rate of change is not going to slow down anytime soon. If anything, competition in most industries will probably speed up even more in the next few decades.": "John",

Barcelona is my home because both the club and the people here have given me everything, but I won't stop being Argentine.": "Lionel",
  "I was taught over and over again that the accumulation of random mutations led to evolutionary change - led to new species. I believed it until I looked for evidence.": "Lynn",
  "First of all, Greece won't go down. We're talking about a country that is capable of making change. Europe will not allow the destabilization of the 27-country euro zone.

  "If you compare Everest photographs in 1953 with its current state, things are melting. I imagine if I were a golfer in Indiana, I'd be hard-pressed to believe in climate change because nothing's going on there. But when you're up in the mountains and seeing the glaciers melt away, it's an obvious physical manifestation of a warming planet.": "Conrad",
  "Early in life I had to choose between honest arrogance and hypocritical humility. I chose the former and have seen no reason to change.": "Frank",

  "I was wired to be intense. I don't think that's ever going to change.": "Dan",
  "I think it's an actor's responsibility to change every time. Not only for himself and the people he's working with, but for the audience. If you just go out and deliver the same dish every time... it's meat loaf again... you'd get bored. I'd get bored.": "Johnny",

  "The why is what makes journalism an adult game. The why is what makes policy coherent and useful. The why is what transforms bureaucrats and foot soldiers and political leaders into viable instruments of rational and affirmative change. The why is everything and without it, the very suggestion of human progress becomes a cosmic joke.": "David",
  "Really, each era has its own false nostalgia. We all put a picket fence up around something. For my generation it was the '50s, and for other generations it will be something else. Change is scary for everyone, as is complexity, contradiction, and an uncertain future.": "Gary",

  "At a time when the GOP is playing games with the debt limit, a member of the Supreme Court is refusing to recuse himself from matters he has a financial interest in, and middle class incomes are stagnant, many want to change the subject.

  "The precondition to freedom is security.": "Rand",

We have a lot of fun.": "Jack",

  "Children used to get bullied at school. Now they go home, and that's where the problem starts - because they sit on their phones all night, thinking about who's 'liked' a photo of them, who hates them, who loves them. They don't know what's real and what's not, editing their lives constantly to fit other people's views.": "Jessie",
  "I tend to be so lost in the work that I don't notice the weather. My partner will come home and say, 'Beautiful day, wasn't it?' and I'll say, 'Was it?' as I won't have noticed the real world at all.": "Emma",
  "It's more pressure on women to - if they marry or partner with someone, to partner with the right person. Because you cannot have a full career and a full life at home with your children if you are also doing all of the housework and child care.": "Sheryl",
  "I'm really quite simple. I plant flowers and watch them grow... I stay at home and watch the river flow.": "George",
  "I remembered some people who lived across the street from our home as we were being taken away. When I was a teenager, I had many after-dinner conversations with my father about our internment. He told me that after we were taken away, they came to our house and took everything. We were literally stripped clean.": "George",
  "The killer app that got the world ready for appliances was the light bulb. So the light bulb is what wired the world. And they weren't thinking about appliances when they wired the world. They were really thinking about - they weren't putting electricity into the home. They were putting lighting into the home.": "Jeff",
  "We love our planet Earth. We should - it is our home, and there's no place like home. There can't ever be a better place than Earth.": "Dimitar",
  "We are living in very challenging times. Pressured in the workplace and stressed out at home, people are trying to make sense of their lives.": "Les",
  "I just like sitting at home, chilling and watching a movie.": "Niall",
  "Let architects sing of aesthetics that bring Rich clients in hordes to their knees; Just give me a home, in a great circle dome Where stresses and strains are at ease.": "R.",
  "The instruction we find in books is like fire. We fetch it from our neighbours, kindle it at home, communicate it to others, and it becomes the property of all.": "Voltaire",
  "I think the great thing about grandparents is seeing another home, realising that people you love can have different priorities, different diversions, different opinions and lead quite different lives from the ones you see every day, and that is immensely valuable.": "Simon",
  "Sometimes I can't think of a better way to end my day than coming home and just strumming my ukulele for a few minutes. I mean, I joke around and tell people that it's an entire yoga session in one strum, you know?": "Jake",
  "I told my mother-in-law that my house was her house, and she said, 'Get the hell off my property.'": "Joan",
  "Whether rich or poor, a home is not a home unless the roots of love are ever striking deeper through the crust of the earthly and the conventional, into the very realities of being, not consciously always; seldom, perhaps; the simplicity of loving grows by living simply near nature and God.": "Lucy",
  "You don't have to swing hard to hit a home run. If you got the timing, it'll go.": "Yogi",
  "Everybody thinks I'm, like, a bad boy. I've had my day, but I just sit at home and play the blues mostly.": "Brad",
  "You can fool people. You can fool anybody anytime of the day, but you can't fool yourself. At night, when you go home, you've got to be straight up with you.": "Whitney",
  "Whether at work, at home or in public, we have been trained to believe that who we are at the core of our being is often unacceptable. As a result, we work diligently to live up to - and sometimes down to - what others have made us out to be, whether or not it is an accurate reflection of who we are.": "Iyanla",
  "I'm one of the most adaptable guys I know in as much as travelling is my favourite thing to do in life. With every place I go, I try to stay there long enough to do it justice, long enough so that I can at least imagine what it would be like to live there. Once I imagine that, then it's OK for me to return home.": "Matthew",
  "No matter what happens in a child's home, no matter what other social and economic factors may impede a child, there's no question in my mind that a first-rate school can transform almost everything.": "Jonathan",
  "I am not Superwoman. The reality of my daily life is that I'm juggling a lot of balls in the air trying to be a good wife and mother, trying to be the prime-ministerial consort at home and abroad, barrister and charity worker, and sometimes one of the balls gets dropped.": "Cherie",
  "Somebody once asked me if I ever went up to the plate trying to hit a home run. I said, 'Sure, every time.'": "Mickey",
  "My wife met me at the door the other night in a sexy negligee. Unfortunately, she was just coming home.": "Rodney",
  "Oh, my ways are strange ways and new ways and old ways, And deep ways and steep ways and high ways and low, I'm at home and at ease on a track that I know not, And restless and lost on a road that I know.": "Henry",

  "It's not about finding a home so much as finding yourself.": "Jason",
  "New England is the home of all that is good and noble with all her sternness and uncompromising opinions.": "Ellen",
  "Price is rarely the most important thing. A cheap product might sell some units. Somebody gets it home and they feel great when they pay the money, but then they get it home and use it and the joy is gone.": "Tim",
  "What I've learned in my life, it's a very interesting social study for me, to go back and forth between being the guy at home and being the guy on the road and being the guy in studio and being the guy in the interview. The environment around you has so much to do with your character, and when I'm home, my character really changes quite a bit.": "John",
  "I'm a firm believer that lighting affects mood, and twinkly lights on strings bring something magical to occasions ranging from concerts to weddings, though I'm fond of using them as year-round home decor. There's a reason why they're sometimes called fairy lights. When the night is right, there aren't any strings at all.": "Erin",
  "Most people know that forests are the lungs of our planet, literally playing a critical role in every breath we take. And that they're also home to incredible animals like the orangutan and elephant, which will go extinct if we keep cutting down their forests.": "Chris",
  "I am alone a lot, which is good. I need that time to just be alone after a long day, just decompress. So, I go to either my house or the hotel, or my apartment, or whatever - wherever I am, I go home and I watch TV and I sit there, with my cat, and I just watch TV or go online, check my emails.": "Taylor",
  "Think you're escaping and run into yourself. Longest way round is the shortest way home.": "James",
  "If your neighbors think you're a detective because a cop always brings you home, you might be a redneck.": "Jeff",
  "An oligarchy of race, where the Saxon rules the African, might be endured; but this oligarchy of sex which makes father, brothers, husband, sons, the oligarchs over the mother and sisters, the wife and daughters of every household... carries discord and rebellion into every home of the nation.": "Susan",
  "I hate leaving home. I love what I do, but I'd love to go home every night.": "Charlie",
  "In my own home, where I've been able to create an environment that works for me, I'm hardly disabled at all. I still have an impairment, and there are obviously some very restrictive things about that, but the impact of disability is less.": "Stella",
  "Delhi is my emotional home. I still dream of owning a home there.": "Kabir",
  "I daresay one good concert justifies a week of satisfaction at home.": "Robert",
  "A well-designed home has to be very comfortable. I can't stand the aesthetes, the minimal thing. I can't live that way. My home has to be filled with stuff - mostly paintings, sculpture, my fish lamps, cardboard furniture, lots of books.": "Frank",
  "My kids are just waiting for me at home. I'm their father. They're wondering, 'When's Daddy coming home?'": "Brad",

  "Palestine is our unforgettable historic home. The very name would be a force of marvelous potency for summoning our people together.": "Theodor",
  "Going home helps the content.": "The",
  "I have no idea how to get in touch with anyone anymore. Everyone, it seems, has a home phone, a cell phone, a regular e-mail account, a Facebook account, a Twitter account, and a Web site. Some of them also have a Google Voice number. There are the sentimental few who still have fax machines.": "Susan",
  "I love traveling all over the world but it's true: there's nothing like home. ": "Dolly",
  "Anytime you're in West Virginia or near it, and you sing, 'Take Me Home, Country Roads,' it's a sight to behold.": "Brad",
  "I just owe almost everything to my father and it's passionately interesting for me that the things that I learned in a small town, in a very modest home, are just the things that I believe have won the election.": "Margaret",
  "The coolest thing, and I have it at home, is a huge Hulk Hogan, normal-sized pinball machine. When people come over they play it for hours. When you hit the bumpers and the bells ring it goes, 'Oh yeah!' The whole time you're playing this machine it's yelling and screaming at you, 'What you gonna do, brother?!' I think that's the coolest.": "Hulk",
  "Often I have heard the taunt that suffragists are women who have failed to find any normal outlet for their emotions, and are therefore soured and disappointed beings. This is probably not true of any suffragist, and it is most certainly not true of me. My home life and relations have been as nearly ideal as possible in this imperfect world.": "Emmeline",
  "You create a world away from home and make new rooms for yourself. But when you arrive back home in your old rooms, the world you've made for yourself ceases to be real. Everything seems to crumble. Anyone who's been sent away to boarding school can understand that.": "Colm",
  "Be nice to your children. After all, they are going to choose your nursing home.": "Steven",

  "Home life ceases to be free and beautiful as soon as it is founded on borrowing and debt.": "Henrik",
  "I'm lucky because I have a job I love. I really miss being away from home, being in my own bed, seeing my animals and siblings, having my moms cookies. I have a couple cats. I got a kitten about a year ago and now Im going on the road so I wont see him for a while. I feel bad.": "Michelle",
  "Owning a home is a keystone of wealth - both financial affluence and emotional security.": "Suze",
  "As much as I would love to be a person that goes to parties and has a couple of drinks and has a nice time, that doesn't work for me. I'd just rather sit at home and read, or go out to dinner with someone, or talk to someone I love, or talk to somebody that makes me laugh.": "Daniel",
  "Any old place I can hang my hat is home sweet home to me.": "William",
  "A man's house is his castle.": "James",
  "We share one heart, one home, and one glorious destiny.": "Donald",
  "Take, for example, the African jungle, the home of the cheetah. On whom does the cheetah prey? The old, the sick, the wounded, the weak, the very young, but never the strong. Lesson: If you would not be prey, you had better be strong.": "G.",
  "Canada will be a strong country when Canadians of all provinces feel at home in all parts of the country, and when they feel that all Canada belongs to them.": "Pierre",
  "I love being at home and cooking and baking.": "Blake",
  "I'm just a normal person. It's not like I come home and think about opera. My thoughts are about completely other things. Shoes! Dresses! Expensive ones: with a pretty silhouette, beautiful fabrics.": "Anna",
  "When I was 10 years old, I loved - I loved books, and I used to haunt the secondhand bookshop. And I found a little book I could just afford, and I bought it, and I took it home. And I climbed up my favorite tree, and I read that book from cover to cover. And that was Tarzan of the Apes. I immediately fell in love with Tarzan.": "Jane",
  "When memories fade, can one ever really return home?": "Floyd",
  "There are trees of a thousand sorts, and all have their several fruits; and I feel the most unhappy man in the world not to know them, for I am well assured that they are all valuable. I bring home specimens of them, and also of the land.": "Christopher",
  "If they had a social gospel in the days of the prodigal son, somebody would have given him a bed and a sandwich and he never would have gone home.": "Vance",
  "If I was a book, I would like to be a library book, so I would be taken home by all different sorts of kids.": "Cornelia",
  "I chose America as my home because I value freedom and democracy, civil liberties and an open society.": "George",
  "And, you know, being able to wear the stars and stripes, when you step up on one of the blocks or, you know, when you step off of an airplane or when you hear the national anthem play, you know, it's one of the greatest feelings in the world because you know that there are people at home who are supporting you and watching you.": "Michael",
  "There's a lot more responsibility at home, so a tour is like the opposite for me. It's like a breath of fresh air.": "Travis",
  "When I was a child and they burned me out of my home, I was frightened and I ran away. Eventually I ran far away. It was to a place called France. Many of you have been there, and many have not. But I must tell you, ladies and gentlemen, in that country I never feared. It was like a fairyland place.": "Josephine",
  "I wanted to write something in a voice that was unique to who I was. And I wanted something that was accessible to the person who works at Dunkin Donuts or who drives a bus, someone who comes home with their feet hurting like my father, someone who's busy and has too many children, like my mother.": "Sandra",
  "If we could make our house a home, and then make it a sanctuary, I think we could truly find paradise on Earth.": "Alexandra",

  "Everywhere you hang your hat is home. Home is the bright cave under the hat.": "Lance",
  "Travelling's so much better when you know you've got a lovely home to go back to.": "Toni",
  "What I have always liked about Brighton is its impersonality. Since the 18th century, people have come, used the place and gone home again.": "Lynne",
  "I can't tell you how many times I've gone to present at the Golden Globes, come home, whipped the dress off and read to my daughter wearing gazillion-dollar earrings. That's how it goes in my house, and I wouldn't have it any other way.": "Kate",
  "The idea of prosthetics is a tool. Most people's cell phones are prosthetics. If you leave your cell phone at home, you feel impacted by not having it. It's an important part of your daily function and what you can do in a day.": "Aimee",
  "What makes me really happy is a walk in the English countryside. A nice sunset, that British countryside - it means I'm home.": "Natalie",
  "The whole idea is you can't sit around and do nothing. You have to get up and start living one day at a time. That's what I did my entire career. You can't sit around and say, 'Oh, poor me. Nobody likes me. Nobody is giving me a job.' You have to get up and go. If you sit at home and do nothing, that is what is going to happen.": "Darlene",
  "We turned the switch, saw the flashes, watched for ten minutes, then switched everything off and went home. That night I knew the world was headed for sorrow.": "Leo",
  "Reading isn't good for a ballplayer. Not good for his eyes. If my eyes went bad even a little bit I couldn't hit home runs. So I gave up reading.": "Babe",
  "Just take the ball and throw it where you want to. Throw strikes. Home plate don't move.": "Satchel",
  "The means of defense against foreign danger historically have become the instruments of tyranny at home.": "James",
  "We have weapons of mass destruction we have to address here at home. Poverty is a weapon of mass destruction. Homelessness is a weapon of mass destruction. Unemployment is a weapon of mass destruction.": "Dennis",
  "Analogies, it is true, decide nothing, but they can make one feel more at home.": "Sigmund",
  "It is better for a woman to compete impersonally in society, as men do, than to compete for dominance in her own home with her husband, compete with her neighbors for empty status, and so smother her son that he cannot compete at all.": "Betty",
  "Words today are like the shells and rope of seaweed which a child brings home glistening from the beach and which in an hour have lost their luster.": "Cyril",
  "Firefighters are indispensable foot soldiers here at home.": "Christopher",
  "The juvenile sea squirt wanders through the sea searching for a suitable rock or hunk of coral to cling to and make its home for life. For this task, it has a rudimentary nervous system. When it finds its spot and takes root, it doesn't need its brain anymore so it eats it!": "Daniel",
  "I'll fill those canyons in your soul, like a river lead you home. And I'll walk a step behind, in the shadows so you shine. Just ask, it will be done and I will prove my love, until you're sure that I'm the one.": "Gary",

  "Last winter when I was coming home from church one Thursday evening, I saw somebody run around the house again. I told my father of that.": "Lizzie",

  "Like after a nice walk when you have seen many lovely sights you decide to go home, after a while I decided it was time to go home, let us put the cubes back in order. And it was at that moment that I came face to face with the Big Challenge: What is the way home?": "Erno",
  "You can't do some of the things you used to do. I suppose you have to go at a gentler pace. I mean, God help us, you can't sit at home being a Vicar or anything.": "Andy",
  "But inspiration? - That's when you come home from abroad and are asked: Well, have you found inspiration? - and fortunately you haven't. But the impressions sink in, of course, and may emerge later: None of us has invented the house; that was done many thousands of years ago.": "Arne",
  "Also, I walk and hike in several different nearby parks near our home several early mornings a week.": "Malcolm",
  "I came into the game when I broke into the major leagues, the minimum salary was seven thousand dollars, and I'd have to go home in the wintertime and get a job.": "Nolan",
  "But if there's an erosion at home, you know, Thomas Jefferson warned about a tyranny of an oligarchy and if we surrender our democracy to the tyranny of an oligarchy, we've made a terrible mistake.": "Pat",

  "One small cat changes coming home to an empty house to coming home.": "Pam",
  "We all have times when we go home at night and pull out our hair and feel misunderstood and lonely and like we're falling. I think the brain is such that there is always going to be something missing.": "Jude",

  "In an ideal world, I'd spend every weekend at my home in Zermatt in Switzerland.": "Vanessa",

  "I like being married. I'm at home with my wife and kids all the time now. I don't go out for wild nights.": "Jack",
  "As we try to compete in this global marketplace, we need to rebuild our infrastructure. We need to rebuild our schools. We need to make sure that teachers and first responders and veterans who are coming home from serving our country so proudly have jobs waiting for them.": "Valerie",
  "There is only one home to the life of a river-mussel; there is only one home to the life of a tortoise; there is only one shell to the soul of man: there is only one world to the spirit of our race.

  "Mr. Bean is at his best when he is not using words, but I am equally at home in both verbal and nonverbal expression.": "Rowan",
  "I think what is British about me is my feelings and awareness of others and their situations. English people are always known to be well mannered and cold but we are not cold - we don't interfere in your situation. If we are heartbroken, we don't scream in your face with tears - we go home and cry on our own.": "Michael",
  "It's easy to underestimate the real cost of home ownership.": "Suze",
  "It's not like I'm this glamour diva who hands everything over and I just sit on my throne at home.": "Heidi",
  "I actually haven't been on many dates, but I like just chilling around at home and watching a movie with a girl.": "Niall",
  "I like my home and I like the nature.": "Billy",
  "I don't really remember the day we lost our home in the floods, but looking back I can understand how devastating it was for my parents. I was only six, so I remember us having to move to Adelaide - but not much of the actual day and night of the flood. We had to start all over again and my parents opened a cafe.": "Samantha",
  "I'm lucky my wife is a strong woman. She's one of the stronger people I've ever met. It's hard for me to be away, but I know my home life is fine because my wife is there.": "Darius",
  "Sometimes when I get home after a long day, I'll turn on music - I love Latin, disco, and pop - and do my own workout, even if it's a short one. Know a good song to work out to? 'I Will Survive.'": "Summer",
  "The world is my workshop. It is not my home.": "Abbas",
  "Our culture does not teach us this, but what happens in Vegas does not stay in Vegas. If you cheat in Vegas, it comes right home with you. If you cheat in Vegas, you walk home as a cheater. You lie awake at a night a cheater. You cannot escape it.": "Tom",
  "The hardest thing about being a full time chef is leaving my work behind when I go home at night. I'll toss and turn about a menu item or forget to order produce and wake up at 4 A.M. in a cold sweat over some artichokes.": "Alexandra",
  "While I encourage people to save 100% down for a home, a mortgage is the one debt that I don't frown upon.": "Dave",
  "Long weekends at festivals, short weeks at home, all summer long: now that is surely preferable to the immense cost and headache of the nuclear family holiday in the sun?": "Tom",
  "I can understand why a single parent, working two jobs, would find it easier to stop at McDonald's with the kids rather than cook something from scratch at home.": "Eric",
  "It's impossible to change the social without changing the personal - you have to put your money where your mouth is. And if you're not making those challenges at home, it's unlikely you'll make them in a larger setting.": "Carrie",
  "One of the things which make any company successful, in particular the Home Depot, was that we understood and catered to the customer. If it didn't sell, it didn't make a difference what we thought or our research told us. They told us if it was successful by buying it or not.": "Bernard",
  "In my songs, I'm not saying something that's never been said before. The have lyrics aren't going to blow people away. It's the emotion and the melody that drive it home.": "Bruno",
  "If I'm in work mode and going to meetings, I'll make an effort and dress up, but when I'm at home or just chilling, I'm in beanies and jeans and sneakers.": "Maia",
  "Guns go home with the soldiers, but landmines are designed to kill - mindlessly, out of control, for years.": "Jody",
  "I don't think about tennis 24/7. I enjoy time on the lake at my Florida home and just being lazy on the sofa.": "Andy",
  "There is a strong side to me, that is of a homemaker. I look forward to spending time at home in the evenings, cooking a meal, chatting with my parents and inviting friends over.": "Deepika",
  "When I get home, I'm not the boss like I am at work - I slip into a more feminine role. I take everything off and put on my Stella McCartney silk robe. I'll put on a red lip or red nails, and it lifts my mood. Sexy underwear also gives you a spark.": "Miranda",
  "At home in Ghaziabad, everyone is a pure vegetarian. In fact, when I want to cook non-veg there, my mum shoos me out on the terrace where I have my cooking utensils. I'm told categorically that whatever non-veg or egg, etc., that I have to cook, I should do upstairs and not enter her kitchen at all.": "Suresh",
  "It's particularly hard to take being stabbed in the back close to home. There's always a feeling of betrayal when people of your own group oppose you.": "Catharine",

  "Housework is what a woman does that nobody notices unless she hasn't done it.": "Evan",

  "I just moved into a new house, so I love spending time at home. Everything for me is all about self-care because I really feel that if I'm at my best, than I'm able to come to my job and really be feeling the best, so if I'm not working out or going on a hike, than I'm at home recharging and cooking dinner and hanging out with my cat.": "Lea",

  "Your home is regarded as a model home, your life as a model life. But all this splendor, and you along with it... it's just as though it were built upon a shifting quagmire. A moment may come, a word can be spoken, and both you and all this splendor will collapse.": "Henrik",

  "An artist has no home in Europe except in Paris.": "Friedrich",
  "If your parent is deployed and you are that young, you spend the whole time wondering where they are and waiting for them to come home. As time passes and the absence is longer and longer, you become more and more concerned - but you don't really have the words to express your concern. There's only this continued absence.": "Suzanne",
  "When you live far away, home looks a little different every time.": "Gideon",
  "I never learned hate at home, or shame. I had to go to school for that.": "Dick",
  "The one thing that offends me the most is when I walk by a bank and see ads trying to convince people to take out second mortgages on their home so they can go on vacation. That's approaching evil.": "Jeff",

  "Potential home buyers have a two-step decision process. First, they determine whether they can afford to make a purchase - does their income safely cover their mortgage payment? Then they determine whether owning is a better financial choice than renting - are the costs of owning a home lower than the cost of renting it?": "Mark",
  "Push-ups are seriously the best way to tone your arms - and they tone your abs at the same time! I like to do them when I'm home watching TV or listening to music.": "Cassie",

  "Leaving home in a sense involves a kind of second birth in which we give birth to ourselves.": "Robert",
  "I go home and stay there. I wash and scrub up each day, and that's it. One month I actually grew a moustache, just so I could say that I'd done something.": "Bill",
  "Building a proper wardrobe is like building a home. Indeed, you should think of it like a home, because it is something you're going to live in. It must be comfortable and suit all your needs.": "Edith",
  "At home, when the heating pipes made noises, I imagined a tiny person was in there skipping with a rope. The fantasy world of tiny things became my escape.": "Willard",
  "There's just no place like Scotland when the sun is out. I just love coming home.": "Ashley",
  "Heavenly Father has assigned us to a great variety of stations to strengthen and, when needed, to lead travelers to safety. Our most important and powerful assignments are in the family. They are important because the family has the opportunity at the start of a child's life to put feet firmly on the path home.": "Henry",

  "I am more valuable to my team hitting .330 then swinging for home runs.": "Roberto",
  "Homesickness is nothing. Fifty percent of the people in the world are homesick all the time.": "John",
  "To the former child migrants, who came to Australia from a home far away, led to believe this land would be a new beginning, when only to find it was not a beginning, but an end, an end of innocence - we apologise and we are sorry. To the mothers who lost the maternal right to love and care for their child - we apologise, and we are sorry.": "Malcolm",
  "So I'm more at home with my backpack, sleeping in a hotel room or on a bus or on an airplane, than I am necessarily on a bed. It's weird being here. It feels like I'm standing next to my real life.": "Henry",
  "The way to work with a bully is to take the ball and go home. First time, every time. When there's no ball, there's no game. Bullies hate that. So they'll either behave so they can play with you or they'll go bully someone else.": "Seth",
  "Doesn't the world see the suffering of millions of Palestinians who have been living in exile around the world or in refugee camps for the past 60 years? No state, no home, no identity, no right to work. Doesn't the world see this injustice?": "Ismail",
  "Everybody aspires to an affordable home, a secure job, better living standards, reliable healthcare and a decent pension. My generation took those things for granted, and so should future generations.": "Jeremy",
  "Coming home, we stopped for a bite to eat and ran into a confused waitress. Had a heart-rending time trying to speak the Words of Life to her, and as I think of all this country now, many just as confused, and more so, I realized that the 39th Street bus is as much a mission field as Africa ever was.": "Jim",
  "My only concern was to get home after a hard day's work.": "Rosa",
  "There is no sanctuary of virtue like home.": "Edward",
  "If you want to be certain, you should never get married. You should never change jobs. In fact, you might as well just stay home. Because I don't know anybody who is certain. That need to be certain is just procrastination.": "Mark",
  "If one more 'journalist' makes a cavalier statement about me and my band, I will personally or with my fans' help, greet them at their home and discover just how much they believe in their freedom of speech.": "Marilyn",
  "My idea of heaven used to be relaxing at home with a cheese plate and champagne.": "Lea",
  "My first job was in a nursing home - a terrible place in retrospect. It was in an old house, and the residents were so lonely. People rarely visited them. I only stayed there a couple of months, but it made a strong impression on me.": "Kim",
  "Fresh out of college, you tend to join a company because it's a job. But, you tend to stay because it becomes a career; you start to feel at home. In the beginning of your career, you're focused on you: 'I like this place because I'm doing rewarding work; they take good care of me; the people are nice; there's runway for me,' etc.": "Ursula",
  "I was teased if I brought my books home. I would take a paper bag to the library and put the books in the bag and bring them home. Not that I was that concerned about them teasing me - because I would hit them in a heartbeat. But I felt a little ashamed, having books.": "Walter",
  "At home, we live on the beach, and it's like every day is a date.": "Grant",

  "Even today, you get criticized if you're staying at home, because you're not doing enough with your life, but you get criticized for being a career woman because you're not raising your kids.": "Sarah",
  "I love to eat cucumber sticks with yogurt. It's a great snack to have at home, especially when I'm having house guests.": "Gabriela",
  "I do become a recluse once in a while. It's so nice to just be at home and to not have to deal with the outside world.": "Kourtney",
  "Basically, when I get home I just do emails for around three hours, which stinks. I have a thing about getting into your inbox every night before going to bed. I'm usually working from my laptop or my phone, desperately trying to get my inbox to zero before I fall asleep.": "Ivanka",
  "I love Africa, and Ulusaba, our home in South Africa, is pretty special. It's on a rocky hill overlooking the bush, and from your room, you can see lions stalking zebras by the waterhole.": "Richard",
  "I couldn't be where I am today if I had children. My focus would be on my children and home. And you can do it later in life.": "Loni",
  "Journalism's ultimate purpose is to inform the reader, to bring him each day a letter from home and never to permit the serving of special interests.": "Arthur",

  "I keep my own personality in a cupboard under the stairs at home so that no one else can see it or nick it.": "Dawn",
  "More fundamentally, it is a dream that does not die with the onset of manhood: the dream is to play endlessly, past the time when you are called home for dinner, past the time of doing chores, past the time when your body betrays you past time itself.": "John",
  "We should be the natural home for young mothers. But we're not. Because too often we sound like people who think the only good mother is a married mother.": "Francis",
  "Who says Australia offers not a home for every poor Englishman, or any other countryman that finds his way to our shores? And what sort of thanks do we get for it?": "Henry",

  "However painful the process of leaving home, for parents and for children, the really frightening thing for both would be the prospect of the child never leaving home.": "Robert",

  "Ladies and gentlemen, god bless America - land of the free, home of the brave.": "Dave",
  "We have the insight and the tools to identify and bring to fruition the dormant talent that our artists possess. Favored Nations will be branded as the home base for inspired musical talent.": "Steve",
  "Buy with your heart, not your head. You can look at all the aspects that make a purchase practical, but that kind of thinking makes it an investment rather than a home.": "Barbara",
  "I do 280 episodes of TV a year, write 15 recipes for the magazine, and publish an annual book. With all of that, we try to get one weekend a month with Isaboo at our home in the Adirondacks to relax and recharge.": "Rachael",
  "I'm an afternoon tea type of girl. I come from a Russian background where we love our teas. So between lunch and dinner after training I come home and I love a nice cup of tea with jam in it, as we drink it there. Black English Breakfast with raspberry jam is my favorite.": "Maria",
  "I've never been a hands-on dad. I'm not ashamed to admit it, but you can't run a restaurant and be home for tea at 4:30 and bath and change nappies.": "Gordon",
  "Because I'm a chef, I eat out frequently, so it's hard for me to control what I consume in terms of calories. But when I'm at home, I eat what my wife cooks for me. She works hard to avoid making foods that are high in calories and cholesterol, so most of the time, she makes vegetarian dishes.": "Masaharu",
  "I didn't have nothin' going for me... school, home... until I found something I loved, which was music, and that changed everything.": "Eminem",

  "It is easier to take a position in the abstract than when it hits home.": "Dennis",
  "We need to rediscover the idea of the common good and work together to build a home.": "Jonathan",
  "Well, I'm not good with sliminess. I hate the thought of creatures that have slime on them or creatures that leave a slimy trail. At home, the sight of a slug can bring up my breakfast.": "Jenny",
  "My idea of home is not necessarily a place.": "Michael",
  "For many years I enjoyed the pleasure of cruising on my yacht all summer long and these were my best holidays. In mid-May, we'd start in St Tropez. I'd collect my bikinis from my home there and then we'd go up to Cannes for the Film Festival, on to Monte Carlo for the Grand Prix and then to Italy.": "Ivana",
  "You start realizing that maybe you're the one night a month that people have out, and they don't need to hear your political views or how dark you can get. They just want to laugh for an hour and go home. Once I wrapped my head around that, my act evolved accordingly.": "Billy",
  "Paris is beautiful, but nothing beats home.": "Patrick",
  "Gimmicks come and go the cop show seems one genre that will never leave - not as long as people like to sit at home in the suburbs and see what awful things go on in the cities. ": "Tom",
  "Most of the time, people look at a piece of art online when it is just a few blocks from their house. Changing the way you walk home everyday fills life with surprises.": "JR",
  "My homies in Gadsden aren't as exposed as I am culturally, which is awesome - that's why I love going home. I'm in the kitchen with people who don't know anything but the simple life, what's important to them, and what's dope.": "Yelawolf",
  "I have a home in Orlando. That's kind of my default 'getaway' city.": "Carrot",

  "I came from a Halloween-friendly home. My dad, Spencer, was a U.S. Marine captain. But when it came to Halloween, my dad had a soft spot. He would take his three sons and friends on escapades on Halloween night.": "Bill",

  "Well, because I'm naturally a tomboy, when I have sleepovers with girls, they end up going home and crying.": "Alexa",

  "I still close my eyes and go home - I can always draw from that.": "Dolly",
  "One of the best things to come out of the home computer revolution could be the general and widespread understanding of how severely limited logic really is.": "Frank",
  "I really like having a life outside work. I sometimes wish I did more career stuff and was in that Hollywood scene a bit more. But Toronto's my home.": "Rachel",
  "I actually do think you're seeing this trend towards organizations just caring more about their brand and engaging. And so I think Home Depot will want to humanize itself. I think that's a lot of why companies are starting blogs, are just giving more insight into what's going on with them.": "Mark",
  "The aesthetic came along the way, I think - just through experimenting, and going on tour, and trying stuff out on stage, having fun with it, and not taking it too seriously. If I had a ballgown at home, I'd wear it onstage. If I found something in a charity shop, I'd wear it. That's where it grew from - just wanting to play dress-up.": "Florence",
  "I'm the type who'd be happy not going anywhere as long as I was sure I knew exactly what was happening at the places I wasn't going to. I'm the type who'd like to sit home and watch every party that I'm invited to on a monitor in my bedroom.": "Andy",
  "Kindness goes a long ways lots of times when it ought to stay at home.": "Kin",
  "I kiss the soil as if I placed a kiss on the hands of a mother, for the homeland is our earthly mother. I consider it my duty to be with my compatriots in this sublime and difficult moment.": "Pope",
  "To be happy at home is the ultimate result of all ambition, the end to which every enterprise and labor tends, and of which every desire prompts the prosecution.": "Samuel",
  "People who have good relationships at home are more effective in the marketplace.": "Zig",
  "I am not quite sure where home is right now. I do have places in London and Milan, and a house in Spain. I guess I would say home is where my mother is, and she lives in Spain.": "Sarah",
  "There is something permanent, and something extremely profound, in owning a home.": "Kenny",
  "In the mind, in the heart, I was always home. I always imagined, really, going back home.": "Miriam",
  "A heart makes a good home for the friend.": "Yunus",
  "The house has to please everyone, contrary to the work of art which does not. The work is a private matter for the artist. The house is not.": "Adolf",
  "I'm going to buy some green bananas because by the time I get home they'll be ripe.": "Ryan",
  "Our home had many books due principally to the educational interests of my sister and two brothers, all of whom where serious students engaged in professional studies; my sister became a doctor of medicine and my brothers became lawyers.": "Frederick",
  "I noted that people are happy here in India. When I went back home, people had everything in the materialistic sense and were surrounded with abundance, but they were not happy.": "Goldie",
  "The thing I like about baseball is that it's one-on-one. You stand up there alone, and if you make a mistake, it's your mistake. If you hit a home run, it's your home run.": "Hank",
  "This stammer got me a home in Beverly Hills, and I'm not about to screw with it now.": "Bob",
  "As they marched, the crowds lining the route broke into applause, a sweet and deeply felt spontaneous pattering that was a sort of communal embrace. Welcome home.": "Lance",
  "I have become a queer mixture of the East and the West, out of place everywhere, at home nowhere.": "Jawaharlal",

  "Managing is getting paid for home runs that someone else hits.": "Casey",

  "I'm the type of woman you might say is too good. I'll massage a man's feet, have dinner cooked when he gets home. But once they leave, the door is closed, and the locks are changed.": "Angie",
  "When I joined Custer I donned the uniform of a soldier. It was a bit awkward at first but I soon got to be perfectly at home in men's clothes.": "Calamity",
  "I'm shocked at how early everything closes here. But people start earlier. I miss the late nightlife in NYC, but then again I sing and burn so much energy in the show that it's probably good - I get to go home and sleep.": "Neil",
  "I was born in London, and went to school in Scotland - I used to be dead tired when I got home at night.": "Norman",
  "I was actually lost in Beirut on the way home.": "Kelly",
  "Say there's a white kid who lives in a nice home, goes to an all-white school, and is pretty much having everything handed to him on a platter - for him to pick up a rap tape is incredible to me, because what that's saying is that he's living a fantasy life of rebellion.": "Eminem",
  "I'm actually a pretty decent human being, and when I'm home I'm straight as an arrow.": "Kid",
  "Although I managed my schedule to be home by late afternoon most days, basically, Roselle raised our children alone. And so I missed out on a lot of wonderful moments, missed watching my kids grow into the wonderful people they are today.": "Perry",
  "It was the most pleasurable thing I've ever done, playing this character, and I just remember feeling so at home and so - I don't know, I was just happy - and it just wasn't ever work! It was like a sandbox for me, and I would crack myself up rehearsing.": "Jenna",
  "There was a military police brigade with over 3,400 soldiers getting ready to go home because their mission - prisoner-of-war operations - was finished.": "Janis",
  "I have a dress-up chest at home. I love to create this fantasy kind of thing.": "Kate",
  "How we are using up our home, how we are living and polluting the planet is frightening. It was evident when I was a child. It's more evident now.": "Maya",
  "On tour, you never have a home, you don't get used to anything, and you're always super busy.": "Travis",
  "I never saw film stars at home. We had no maid, no cook, no swimming pool.": "Natalie",
  "I was often very, incredibly naughty, and if I didn't come home at tea time I used to be sent to bed without any dinner. But people used to bring me things: I was better fed in bed.": "Diane",
  "That said, my kids are at home right now with my husband and I'm missing something important at my daughter's school which makes me feel sick inside. It's a lot of balance and a lot of really hard decision making.": "Reese",
  "More than anything else, I want the folks back at home to think right of me.": "Elvis",
  "Just because I managed to do a little something, I don't want anyone back home to think I got the big head.": "Elvis",
  "On stage, I make love to 25,000 different people, then I go home alone.": "Janis",
  "At home I am a nice guy: but I don't want the world to know. Humble people, I've found, don't get very far.": "Muhammad",

  "We have supported state terrorism against the Palestinians and black South Africans, and now we are indignant because the stuff we have done overseas is now brought right back to our own front yards. America's chickens are coming home to roost.": "Jeremiah",
  "I'm kind of a dork. I don't have much game. I'm not particularly comfortable in bars or clubs. I much prefer being home playing Scrabble, having dinner with a couple friends, going to see a movie, or losing a whole weekend to Season 14 of Law and Order or The Simpsons.": "Wentworth",

  "Anytime you're away from your home filming, it messes with your head.": "Jennifer",
  "Today's misery is real unemployment, home foreclosures and bankruptcies. This is the Obama Misery Index and its at a record high. Its going to take more than new rhetoric to put Americans back to work - its going to take a new president.": "Mitt",
  "So long as I can stay mentally alert - inquiring, curious - I want to keep going. I love my wife and my children, but I don't want to sit around at home with them. We go on safaris and things like that. I can do that for a couple of weeks a year. I'm just not ready to stop, to die.": "Rupert",
  "I have a five year-old son and a three year-old daughter. I want my son to have a choice to contribute fully in the workforce or at home. And I want my daughter to have the choice to not just succeed, but to be liked for her accomplishments.": "Sheryl",

  "I feel an obligation to set the record straight. Actors that say they're affected by something, that it changes their life, that they take it home with them, they're just trying to get nominated for an Oscar!": "Joaquin",
  "When I'm home, I cook my own dinner, all organic.": "Big",
  "These days, you have the option of staying home, blogging in your underwear, and not having your words mangled. I think I like the direction things are headed.": "Marc",
  "I'm in this absolutely gorgeous manor house with acres of quite beautiful countryside. I've got trout in the river, an organic vegetable garden, I've got my work 40 yards from my home. I don't mind being criticised, but where are they criticising from? Which hut are they criticising me from, exactly?": "Jay",
  "Obviously, the easiest recipes are the most successful when it comes to the home cook, because they're not intimidated by them. If I'm doing 'Boy Meets Grill,' and I do something very simple like grilled hamburgers or steaks or chicken, those are the most sought-after recipes.": "Bobby",
  "I can't grill vegetables, shellfish or steaks without tongs. Don't bother with those long-handled grilling tongs normally found in the BBQ section of your home store. Get intimate with your grill and opt for the regular stainless steel tongs.": "Bobby",
  "I'm from a small town so, like, everyone's married with children or about to have children. So it's a little hard when you go home and people are like - and that's why people think I'm gay - because they're like 'Why aren't you married?' And I'm like, 'it doesn't happen for everyone right off the bat.'": "Kelly",
  "My company is an extension of me, so when I designed my stores I wanted people to feel that they were in my home.": "Tory",
  "For those who have come here illegally, they might have a transition time to allow them to set their affairs in order. And then go back home and get in line with everybody else. And if they get in line and they apply to become a citizen and get a green card, they will be treated like everybody else.": "Mitt",
  "Locally produced foods - defined as those harvested within a 100-mile radius of one's home - have a lesser impact on the environment because of the decreased need for transportation from source to consumer.": "Tyler",
  "My father was always depressed. When he was home and sober, he was mostly in his room.": "Sherman",
  "My father probably thought the capital of the world was wherever he was at the time. It couldn't possibly be anyplace else. Where he and his wife were in their own home, that, for them, was the capital of the world.": "Bob",
  "I'm happy going home early and working out and just being a mother and being a wife.": "Kim",
  "We have to judge politicians by their cumulative score. In one innings they make a great catch, in another they drop the ball. In one they score a home run, in another they strike out. But it is their cumulative batting average that we are interested in.": "Jesse",
  "There's a continuity between what I care about in any form: I care about it in my music, in article-writing, in how I dress, in how I live, in my relationships, in how I navigate paparazzi, how I decorate my home. There's such a continuity between everything that I don't really care what form it shows up in.": "Alanis",

  "Once I was gone for a month and I was just miserable, so I flew back from Florida for two hours just to be home and see my cats.": "Paula",
  "I think any branding for me is band-related. It's really weird to get used to the exposure, because I am a naturally introverted person, and I'm not exactly social. Occasionally I can get comfortable enough to talk, but I spend a lot of my days not talking, especially when I'm at home and not on tour.": "Nate",
  "I don't get to go home as much as I used to, which is a shame. But I don't mind because my mum moved over to London to look after me. I rented her a house just around the corner.": "Niall",
  "I support workplace clean air. But a federal ban on smoking would mean that you couldn't smoke in your own home. I don't care what people do in their home.": "Mike",
  "My sisters both are working mothers. I understand that my being an actress as well as being at home isn't some heroic thing. That doesn't mean it isn't confusing or difficult - especially that question of how you find a balance.": "Jennifer",
  "At times you feel like you're the only voice speaking out to improve the working conditions of people, whether it's to be able to collectively bargain, to get adequate pay, to know that you can come home safe out of a coal mine.": "Hilda",
  "The truth is, if anyone saw my home life, I'm pretty sure it would look like other families' around the world. There's a lot of juggling to be done.": "Brooke",
  "Illogical thinkers throw names and slurs around because they have no arguments with which to rebut their opponents. Rational people have to keep hammering their points home.": "Ben",
  "I hate formal stuff. I love looking like a doll and all that stuff and playing dress up, but when I'm home, sweat pants, t-shirt. When I'm in the studio, sweat pants, t-shirt.": "Nicki",
  "The Second Amendment does protect the right to people to possess weapons for self-defense in the home. That's what the Supreme Court said.": "Laurence",
  "I'd be totally exhausted by mid-afternoon, and I could barely climb the stairs at home. It was particularly alarming because all my life I'd enjoyed doing all my own stunts in shows, taking on every physical challenge. Yet suddenly, I'd become like a very old man. I knew something was wrong, but I had no idea what.": "Michael",
  "Many women assume they can't be good mothers and have challenging careers at the same time, so they might give up trying to do both as they get to a crucial point in their career. Although it can be hard at times, it's important for women to recognize the benefits of working outside the home.": "Susan",

  "I am not a home breaker and I can never be. I haven't been brought up to create havoc in other people's homes.": "Kareena",
  "Many Lexington natives believe they live in a special place, one impossible to leave. I'm not so sure about that - or it's more accurate to say I think a more general truth exists beneath it: the place you first call home stays with you always, whether you remain or go.": "Kim",
  "I'm a bachelor in the old sense of the word, meaning I flirt, I have very many close relationships, but then I come home and like to read my book.": "William",
  "I live in a sort of insular world. It's mostly my family, my house, staying home and working.": "Mark",
  "It's often discouraging sitting working at home, wondering whether to put the heating on, answering the doorbell to the gas board, feeling it's all utterly pointless.": "Rachel",
  "In my home office, I have two large, 30-inch computer monitors - a Mac and a PC. They share the same mouse and keyboard, so I can type or copy and paste between them. I'll typically do Web stuff on the Mac and e-mail and chat stuff on the PC.": "Matt",
  "You don't see me in Los Angeles a lot. I go back home. Because I can't play the game. I can't - my tolerance - I know I'm getting old I'll be 50 this year. And you know how I know I'm getting old? 'Cause my tolerance level is low. ": "Bernie",
  "People are responsible adults at home. Why do we suddenly transform them into adolescents with no freedom when they reach the workplace?": "Ricardo",
  "Those days of every child having a mummy and daddy who lived at home - Daddy went to work, and Mummy stayed at home and took care of everyone - those days have almost gone, and it's so much more unconventional now.": "Kate",
  "I think if you follow anyone home, whether they live in Houston or London, and you sit at their dinner table and talk to them about their mother who has cancer or their child who is struggling in school, and their fears about watching their lives go by, I think we're all the same.": "Brene",
  "Let me put it this way: when I read, I learned the world was not as small as my house. And that everybody in my home town was not representative of the way people in the world were raised. And that was what saved me.": "Terry",
  "Ladies love a soppy lyric. There's a real winner in 'Carry You Home.'": "James",
  "I'd never put all my chips anywhere, because I don't want to close any doors, but I was raised in a very blue-collar family. I was raised by parents who said, 'If you don't go to work every day, you're not contributing', so that's my mentality. I have to work every day; I have to bring home a paycheck.": "Katee",
  "You have to be very insensitive in order to have a cat, because I think they're very independent. When they're kittens, you think they're going to have a dog temperament in that they're going to run to the door when you get home, lick you on the face and cuddle with you all the time, but cats are not that way.": "Jennifer",
  "People are easily intimidated when they decorate their home. They think it has to be one way. But there's no one way. It's your way, your style. At the end of the day, you have to live there. It's your cocoon, your nest. You have to be happy in it.": "Bryan",
  "I live in Brooklyn, and I love all the hipsters and all the artisanal bacon you can get here now. I consider New York my home, and L.A. a place that I go. I always say I go with an empty sack and try to fill it with as much money as possible to bring back to New York.": "Julie",
  "Runners and yogis are alike in lots of ways, and not just because some of us need yoga to unkink what running jams. Runners and yogis are also alike because of this tortoise shell idea, this 'home' we can access inside ourselves.": "Kristin",
  "I think anybody who goes away finds you appreciate home more when you return.": "Yo-Yo",
  "A drone is a high-tech version of an old army and a musket. It ought to be used in Somalia to hunt bad guys, but not in America. I don't want to see it hovering over anybody's home.": "Charles",
  "As an actress, I get plenty of drama in my professional life. When I'm at home, I want a peaceful life.": "Lysette",
  "I've read everything Thomas Wolfe ever wrote; my brother and I memorized whole chapters of 'You Can't Go Home Again' and 'Look Homeward, Angel.'": "Maya",
  "I wouldn't call myself a shut-in. I have the ability to leave my home; I just choose not to. But because I'm such a homebody, it's important to be surrounded by things I love.": "Amy",
  "Early on, I played one or two disturbed people, and I guess I must have been good at it, because it stuck. But, you know, I'm a regular guy. I stay home a lot, I make an effort to keep a distance from the whole social thing, the openings, the parties. I try to live in a calm way.": "Christopher",
  "'Feminist comedy,' practically an oxymoron, had a couple of good years after WWII.

  "When I was about ten, I was very impressed by the way Tarzan could swing through the trees from vine to vine. No one ever told me, 'Don't try this at home.'": "James",

  "When I was eight, I would look at the cover of the 'Ghost Rider' comic book in my little home in Long Beach, California, and I couldn't get my head around how something that scary could also be good. To me it was my first philosophical awakening - 'How is this possible, this duality?'": "Nicolas",
  "There's no place like home. And I do miss my home.": "Malala",
  "To be a queen of a household is a powerful thing.": "Jill",
  "I didn't leave home until 27. I was an only child raised in Philadelphia by my mother and grandmother. My grandmother controlled the stove. She made a lot of potato meals - mashed potato, potato souffle, potato pancakes. When we didn't have electricity, we ate romantically by candlelight.": "Jill",
  "There are people with otherwise chaotic and disorganized lives, a certain type of person that's always found a home in the restaurant business in much the same way that a lot of people find a home in the military.": "Anthony",
  "He told me he was working as an interpreter in a doctor's office in Brookline, Massachusetts, where I was living at the time, and he was translating for a doctor who had a number of Russian patients. On my way home, after running into him, I just heard this phrase in my head.": "Jhumpa",

  "Once I am in the square circle, I am in my home.": "Floyd",

  "I would love to have a robot at home.": "Hugh",
  "I feel like I've never had a home, you know? I feel related to the country, to this country, and yet I don't know exactly where I fit in... There's always this kind of nostalgia for a place, a place where you can reckon with yourself.": "Sam",
  "I do not recall a Jewish home without a book on the table.": "Elie",
  "In our home there was always prayer - aloud, proud and unapologetic.": "Lyndon",
  "Not much shocked me. You know, I worked in a home for Alzheimer's patients and my dad used to be really into murders and stuff, so I saw dead bodies. It desensitised me to a lot of things.": "Ellie",
  "I have great childhood memories cow-tipping, going off and getting lost in the bog for hours, and coming home covered in dirt.": "Emily",
  "Because I had my family, I felt like I could be a bird and fly and experience and do. Because I had roots somewhere, I knew that they would love me no matter what, and I could always go back home and they were going to love me.": "Gisele",
  "But now, being a parent, I go home and see my son and I forget about any mistake I ever made or the reason I'm upset. I get home and my son is smiling or he comes running to me. It has just made me grow as an individual and grow as a man.": "LeBron",
  "I like to stay home with my family.": "Mads",
  "I don't think I am that materialistic, actually. Obviously at home in the country the art collection is important, but we have one big room in the middle of the house where we do everything - the television, the kitchen, everything.": "Andrew",
  "In many college classes, laptops depict split screens - notes from a class, and then a range of parallel stimulants: NBA playoff statistics on ESPN.com, a flight home on Expedia, a new flirtation on Facebook.": "Samantha",
  "There's a very real possibility in this industry of going out and leading your life and then going home and being a voyeur of your own life. You can literally go watch yourself - where you went last night, what you did, what the things that people presuppose about you. It's kind of crazy.": "Ryan",
  "There's only one thing harder than living in a home with an adolescent - and that's being an adolescent. The moodiness, the volatility, the wholesale lack of impulse control, all would be close to clinical conditions if they occurred at another point in life. In adolescence, they're just part of the behavioral portfolio.": "Jeffrey",
  "It's not a joke: I really do like being at home.": "Karl",
  "Yesterday, I did some painting then went out to buy an onion and came home and watched 'University Challenge.' The onion was probably the highlight.": "Karl",
  "I'd like to keep work work and life life. It means you've got your life to come back to, somewhere to come home to at night that isn't invaded by your day.": "James",

  "When did it - When did it become okay for someone to hit home runs and forget how to play the rest of the game?": "Ryne",
  "Women work as much as men now, if not more. There's a resurgence of dads in the home and moms working.": "Morena",

  "I want to go home at night and feel discomfort.": "Nicole",
  "While I enjoy spending time in L.A., Britain is my home.": "Michael",

  "The worst feeling in the world is the homesickness that comes over a man occasionally when he is at home.": "E.",
  "The curious are always in some danger. If you are curious you might never come home.": "Jeanette",
  "Theatrical is fantastic. I don't think anything will ever replace the big dark room, the screen and the popcorn. You can kind of do it in your home if you have a nice screen, but it's not the same thing.": "Mel",
  "Ever since viewing screens entered the home, many observers have worried that they put our brains into a stupor. An early strain of research claimed that when we watch television, our brains mostly exhibit slow alpha waves - indicating a low level of arousal, similar to when we are daydreaming.": "Hanna",

  "Nice to see your home fans boo you. That's what loyal support is.": "Wayne",

  "A Jew without Jews, without Judaism, without Zionism, without Jewishness, without a temple or an army or even a pistol, a Jew clearly without a home, just the object itself, like a glass or an apple.": "Philip",
  "A 'Magik' session is a journey through different stages of emotions and the 'Search for Sunrise' is more chilling music for when you come home after a party or when you are just about to go to one.": "Tiesto",
  "Home is the place we love best and grumble the most.": "Billy",
  "I did not enjoy Cambridge. But I shouldn't blame Cambridge alone. I wasn't ready for university or for the wrench of leaving home. It was a big cultural shock.": "Naomie",
  "Imagine if you had baseball cards that showed all the performance stats for your people: batting averages, home runs, errors, ERAs, win/loss records. You could see what they did well and poorly and call on the right people to play the right positions in a very transparent way.": "Ray",

  "When I come home, it's about my kid, who needs to eat, needs to do homework, and needs to get to basketball. I don't have a lot of time to think about me.": "Taraji",
  "I tentatively believe in a god. I was brought up in a fairly religious home. I think the world is compatible with reincarnation, karma, all that stuff.": "Bjorn",
  "We know that when people are safe in their homes, they are free to pursue their dream for a brighter economic future for themselves and their families.": "George",
  "For me, and this may not be everybody, but because I do love country music so much, there's such a feeling of home in Nashville, especially because it's such a small town. You bring up one song, everybody knows who wrote it, everybody knows their mother and what their cell number is, and all of the stories.": "Garrett",
  "What really helps me is being able to record my albums at home - I have more fun experimenting that way, as opposed to working with an engineer, in which case I have to deal with the humiliation of doing take after take, and that can get frustrating.": "John",
  "The mother-in-law came round last week. It was absolutely pouring down. So I opened the door and I saw her there and I said, 'Mother, don't just stand there in the rain. Go home.'": "Les",
  "I grew up in a household where everybody lived at the top of his lungs.": "Frank",
  "I grew up in the Cayman Islands. I didn't play video games or watch TV. I would basically come home from school, throw down my backpack, grab my machete, and go hike and chop down trees to make a fort.": "Armie",
  "Unless you have been to boarding-school when you are very young, it is absolutely impossible to appreciate the delights of living at home.": "Roald",

  "I like my home to be somewhere where my friends can feel like they can put their feet up on the couch and for it to feel like really easy living. I really love to have my friends over, cook dinner for them, catch up, and spend quality time with quality people in my life.": "Stacy",
  "My days in hostel were tough. I was ragged by my seniors. We were asked to wash their dirty clothes, do their odd jobs, etc. When it came to eating, we would be often given burnt rotis and milk that had awful odour. But, never once did I call home. I knew if I had to become a tough cricketer, I would have to handle the pressure.": "Suresh",
  "The thing about being at home versus being out in the world working is, it's a whole different vibe. When I'm home with my kids and partner, I will cook - even though she's a very good cook. She's learned over the years. We started with basics, you know, how to saute onions, how to saute mushrooms.": "Cat",
  "Charity should begin at home, but should not stay there.": "Phillips",

  "If anyone thinks that Jews can steal into the land of their fathers, he is deceiving either himself or others. Nowhere is the coming of Jews so promptly noted as in the historic home of the Jews, for the very reason that it is the historic home.": "Theodor",
  "I thought I'd love to be a gardener because I grew up with a vegetable garden and I love being close to the Earth and growing things. At my home in L.A., I have a great garden and I grow all kinds of things. I even have a worm farm! The worms help create organic compost out of kitchen scraps.": "Curtis",
  "When I go home, its an easy way to be grounded. You learn to realize what truly matters.": "Tony",
  "The bees learn where they live by landmarks. If they're moved within their home range, they get confused.": "Gene",
  "Christian values were important at home. Cleanliness. Don't steal. Don't lie. Those were the rules, and they were strictly enforced. Especially the stealing and lying. When you broke the rules, you got a beating. I always broke the rules a lot.": "Jimmy",

  "I'm a real Suzy Homemaker.": "Suzy",
  "For an economic recovery program to be effective, it must not only create a short-term economic boost but also generate lasting value. Home Star would accomplish that by breaking down the key barrier between homeowners and money-saving retrofits: upfront costs.": "Peter",

  "Life is composed of different inventions. I have continued to work at different things and rebuilt my home all by myself. I did it for the sake of satisfaction at doing something.": "Mikhail",
  "I come from a broken home. My parents split up when I was nine. Everyone gave me a good wallop. But I come from a time when you just put up with that, you got on with things rather than sitting moaning about them.": "Len",

  "Now that I have a 16-month-old son, my weekend ritual has changed - but it's better than ever. We get up early and go for a walk on one of the hiking trails near my home in Los Angeles, then meet up with friends at a diner.

  "I have no reason to sit home and write songs all day without going out and playing for the folks. And I have no reason to go play for the folks unless I'm writing new songs so they can sort of feed off one another. And I just try to do the best I can.": "Guy",
  "I think to be in exile is a curse, and you need to turn it into a blessing. You've been thrown into exile to die, really, to silence you so that your voice cannot come home. And so my whole life has been dedicated to saying, 'I will not be silenced.'": "Ariel",

  "When I got home from hospital, and I was in a wheelchair in a plaster body cast, an aeroplane flew over. And I thought to myself, 'Well, if I can't walk, then I might as well fly.' And I was lifted into the aeroplane for the first time. And when I took the controls of the aeroplane, I knew this was something I could do. I thought, 'I can fly.'": "Janine",

  "Anything that makes you feel the most alone also has the greatest power to connect you.": "Ze",
  "I know that when I'm standing alone below a thousand-foot wall, looking up and considering a climb, my sponsors are the furthest thing from my mind. If I'm going to take risks, they are going to be for myself - not for any company.": "Alex",
  "I have been given a list of 35 white farmers in Mashonaland West alone. We say no to whites owning our land, and they should go... They can own companies and apartments... but not the soil. It is ours, and that message should ring loud and clear in Britain and the United States.": "Robert",
  "You alone are enough.": "Oprah",
  "We need someone with superb judgement in their own right because, yes, a president can hire the best advisors on Earth, but I guarantee you this: Five advisors will give five different opinions. And it is the president - and the president alone - who always makes the final call.": "Michelle",
  "Adolescents show off. That's another way of wanting to connect with people. It's not an aspect of human behavior that we generally consider to be very admirable, but it is, in some way, a means of connecting with someone else and not being alone.": "Kenneth",
  "I don't even know how to use a parking meter, let alone a phone box.": "Princess",

  "If words are not things, or maps are not the actual territory, then, obviously, the only possible link between the objective world and the linguistic world is found in structure, and structure alone.": "Alfred",
  "As a farm girl, even when I was quite young, I had my 'farm chores' - but I had time also to be alone, to explore the fields, woods and creek side. And to read.": "Joyce",
  "Telling stories with visuals is an ancient art. We've been drawing pictures on cave walls for centuries. It's like what they say about the perfect picture book. The art and the text stand alone, but together, they create something even better. Kids who need to can grab onto those graphic elements and find their way into the story.": "Deborah",
  "'Option B' draws not just on my story but on the research and stories of many people overcoming all kinds of adversity. No one should have to go through challenges and trauma alone.": "Sheryl",
  "There's a feeling sometimes in motherhood that you're alone in what you're going through, and none of us are alone. We're all going through the same thing.": "Nia",

  "No individual is alone responsible for a single stepping stone along the path of progress, and where the path is smooth progress is most rapid.": "Ernest",
  "Getting stress out of your life takes more than prayer alone. You must take action to make changes and stop doing whatever is causing the stress. You can learn to calm down in the way you handle things.": "Joyce",

  "I have dogs, and it's no secret that I find reptiles interesting, but the thing about reptiles is that they really just wanna be left alone, and I understand them. It's, 'Don't pick me up, stop holding me, don't look at me, just leave me alone.' I have to admit, sometimes I feel like that.": "Nicolas",
  "It is only the forcible propagation of conventional Christianity that makes the agnostic so bitter toward the church. He knows that all the doctrines cannot possibly be true, but he would view them with toleration if he were asked merely to let them alone for the benefit of the masses whom they can help and succour.": "H.",
  "Man alone is born crying, lives complaining, and dies disappointed.": "Samuel",
  "A young girl reached out to me to be her mentor one day, which I didn't really know anything about. What I did remember was what it was to be alone as an African-American dancer in the ballet world and wanting to connect with someone who looks like me.": "Misty",
  "The ability to reflect is associated with critical thinking and reasoning ability. And the capacity to be alone is one of the highest levels of development. It's important to know how to self-soothe and be confident of other people's love even when they're not there in front of you.": "Laurie",

  "I must try and break through the cliches about Latin America. Superpowers and other outsiders have fought over us for centuries in ways that have nothing to do with our problems. In reality we are all alone.": "Gabriel",
  "I have an internal protectiveness where it's like, if it comes to just me, as frightened as I am of losing someone I love or things going sour or simply being alone, there is a dark place in my brain where I'm like, It could happen and I'm okay, I'm prepared.": "Lena",
  "Grave security concerns can arise as a result of demographic trends, chronic poverty, economic inequality, environmental degradation, pandemic diseases, organized crime, repressive governance and other developments no state can control alone. Arms can't address such concerns.": "Ban",

  "No one is alone, and each change here brings about another change there.": "Octavio",
  "I wasn't perfect and didn't have it together. I felt alone. So through acting, I decided to be a shape shifter and with every role become the character instead of being myself. It meant about 10 years of no one knowing I was the same person in every movie.": "Brie",
  "Twenty years ago, I wrote a book called 'It Takes a Village.' And a lot of people looked at the title and asked, 'What the heck do you mean by that?' This is what I mean. None of us can raise a family, build a business, heal a community or lift a country totally alone.": "Hillary",

  "Very few people are original. There's very little original anything out there. Because to be original means you have to stand alone.": "Susan",
  "Woman is fine for her own satisfaction alone. No man will admire her the more, no woman will like her the better for it. Neatness and fashion are enough for the former, and a something of shabbiness or impropriety will be most endearing to the latter.": "Jane",

  "It's time to end the cruel slaughter of whales and leave these magnificent creatures alone.": "Paul",

  "I've always loved scuba diving and the cell-tickling feel of being underwater, though it poses unique frustrations. Alone, but with others, you may share the same sights and feelings, but you can't communicate well.": "Diane",
  "The first thought that I had about really trying to get sober was, 'Man, I could do a lot of good in the world. I can lead by example and just be this heroic recovery guy.' And that's just a bad reason to get sober. You can't get sober for anybody's benefit, let alone the world at large. You really got to do it for yourself.": "Steve-O",
  "David - the man after God's own heart - was a man of war and a mighty man of valour. When all Israel were on the run, David faced Goliath - alone... with God - and he but a stripling, and well scolded, too, by his brother for having come to see the battle.": "Charles",
  "The thing about markets, and I think the thing people don't understand about that, is markets are not kind, but they're very efficient. So when the marketplace determines an inefficiency in the system, it corrects that, and a market system that's left alone will reward good behavior and punish bad behavior.": "Randy",
  "I'm very open and honest, and I feel like it's important for women to hear that we're not perfect; none of us are perfect. And sometimes we aspire to have these ideas in our heads of what perfection is, and I probably would've been better off if I'd left myself alone.": "Adrienne",
  "When I'm writing, I separate from everyone. Even my band. I push myself, and I'm alone with my thoughts. Separating from friends and comforts and family lets you think a lot deeper about subject matter. Working alone drives me a little crazy, but it makes the writing as honest as possible.": "Vic",
  "All the goodness I have within me is totally from the Lord alone. When I sin, it is from me and is done on my own, but when I act righteously, it is wholly and completely of God.": "Charles",
  "I used to spend a lot of time alone as a kid, creating characters and doing voices in my room, and I thought to myself, I'm either going to go absolutely nuts, or I'm going to find something to put that energy into.": "Rami",
  "No books ever go into my laboratory. The thing I am to do and the way are revealed to me the moment I am inspired to create something new. Without God to draw aside the curtain, I would be helpless. Only alone can I draw close enough to God to discover His secrets.": "George",
  "My reputation as a ladies' man was a joke. It caused me to laugh bitterly through the 10,000 nights I spent alone.": "Leonard",
  "I have a characteristic since my childhood. I don't like living together with my mother, sister, or friends at my home. I have always preferred to be alone and independent and lived according to that.": "Mustafa",
  "I think some people are good at being alone, and some people aren't, and as a child, I really liked it.": "Karin",
  "In 2014, having children is complicated and daunting and fraught - as much as it's always been, but now we're talking about it. And the more we talk about it, the more of us will realize that we're not going through it alone. Far from it.": "Rachel",

  "People eat duck and you think, well, we've got loads of chickens, leave the ducks alone!": "Karl",
  "Solitude is very different from a 'time-out' from our busy lives. Solitude is the very ground from which community grows. Whenever we pray alone, study, read, write, or simply spend quiet time away from the places where we interact with each other directly, we are potentially opened for a deeper intimacy with each other.": "Henri",
  "Writing music and lyrics, you tend to become a control freak - sitting alone in your room with a bare light bulb over your head, writing communist manifestos.": "Jason",
  "If I'm alone, I tend to cook for myself. I do a pretty good job of preparing healthful foods. My go-to is everything in a bowl like quinoa, avocado. Later in the day, scrambled eggs. I'm not a gourmet chef. I cook in bulk very well.": "Ellie",
  "Years of standing in the limelight portraying other people for large amounts of money does not usually lead to a high degree of self-examination, let alone self-criticism.": "Michael",

  "In Genesis, it says that it is not good for a man to be alone; but sometimes it is a great relief.": "John",

  "Every animal leaves traces of what it was man alone leaves traces of what he created. ": "Jacob",
  "It is not necessary that you leave the house. Remain at your table and listen. Do not even listen, only wait. Do not even wait, be wholly still and alone. The world will present itself to you for its unmasking, it can do no other, in ecstasy it will writhe at your feet.": "Franz",

  "For so long as the Jew has even one ally, he will be convinced - in his smallness of mind - that his salvation came from that ally. It is only when he is alone - against all of his own efforts and frantic attempts - that he will, through no choice, be compelled to turn to G-d.": "Meir",
  "Social democracy seeks and finds the ways, and particular slogans, of the workers' struggle only in the course of the development of this struggle, and gains directions for the way forward through this struggle alone.": "Rosa",
  "I just don't want to die alone, that's all. That's not too much to ask for, is it It would be nice to have someone care about me, for who I am, not about my wallet.": "Richard",
  "Like they say, you can learn more from a guide in one day than you can in three months fishing alone.": "Mario",
  "Human beings do not live in the objective world alone, nor alone in the world of social activity as ordinarily understood, but are very much at the mercy of the particular language which has become the medium of expression for their society.": "Edward",
  "For people who are really talented, what you don't say becomes extremely important. You have to judge what to say and what to leave alone so you can let the talent develop.": "Itzhak",
  "If I have freedom in my love, And in my soul am free, - Angels alone that soar above, Enjoy such liberty.": "Richard",
  "The revolution in Russia was victorious with the help of the poor peasants. This should always be borne in mind here in Western Europe and all the world over. But the workers in Western Europe stand alone: this should never be forgotten in Russia.": "Herman",
  "The secret to being a writer is that you have to write. It's not enough to think about writing or to study literature or plan a future life as an author. You really have to lock yourself away, alone, and get to work.": "Augusten",
  "The Holy Spirit alone can do this, the Holy Spirit alone can establish this link with one's neighbor.": "Jacques",
  "I'm a workaholic. Before long I'm traveling on my nervous energy alone. This is incredibly exhausting.": "Eva",

  "I believe that no man who holds a leader's position should ever accept favors from either side. He is then committed to show favors. A leader must stand alone.": "Mother",
  "In the first 50 years of the filibuster, it was used only 35 times. But the last Congress alone had 112 cloture motions filed, plus threats of more. This is the tyranny of the minority.": "Peter",

  "Buddhism notes that it is always a mistake to think your soul can go it alone.": "Annie",

  "When I decided to be a singer, my mother warned me I'd be alone a lot. Basically we all are.": "Whitney",

  "When you see a struggle that you may be having personally put on a big screen and in a roomful of people, then it makes you feel less crazy or alone, because you're seeing that other people are dealing with it too.

  "In America, the dreamers, the disabled and the disadvantaged are not left to defend themselves, alone in their struggles.": "Michael",

  "No dream is ever chased alone.": "Rahul",

  "I like the idea of being a sculptor. Just me alone, making something - that solitary existence.": "Ewan",
  "'The Creative Habit' is basically about how you work alone, how you survive as a solitary artist. 'The Collaborative Habit' is obviously about surviving with other people.": "Twyla",
  "In my better sense of mind, I know that I'm far from alone and far from the worst, and the earth keeps spinning. Everything keeps moving, with or without me.": "Phil",

  "I remember when I was very young, I had a fever - a long rheumatic fever in bed for four months. And in the days, I stayed alone with the maid. I only had my father's books with me. They were fantasy books about ghosts, and also books by Edgar Allen Poe that made a forever impression on me.": "Dario",
  "I believe that if it were possible to scrap the whole of existing literature, all writers would find themselves inevitably producing something very close to SF ... No other form of fiction has the vocabulary of ideas and images to deal with the present, let alone the future.": "J.",

  "Casseroles don't have to be about canned ingredients and vegetables you normally wouldn't even think of eating alone, much less stuck in between layers of sauce and breadcrumbs.

  "When I realized I was depressed, then I started reading up about it. When I read that one in four people are depressed, I felt that I'm not the only one.

  "Largely this is a class thing - writers tend to be cosseted little middle-class kiddies who think that the world owes them a royalty cheque.

  "Birds are indicators of the environment. If they are in trouble, we know we'll soon be in trouble.": "Roger",
  "The Chinese have figured out that they have a giant environmental problem. Folks in Beijing, some days, literally can't breathe. Over a million Chinese die prematurely every year because of air pollution.": "Joe",
  "Environmental protection and economic development are not in conflict. Environmental protection is not a burden but a source for innovation. It can increase competition, create jobs, and lifts the economy.": "Chai",
  "Population, when unchecked, goes on doubling itself every 25 years or increases in a geometrical ratio.": "Thomas",
  "We are using resources as if we had two planets, not one. There can be no 'plan B' because there is no 'planet B.'": "Ban",

  "Every time I have some moment on a seashore, or in the mountains, or sometimes in a quiet forest, I think this is why the environment has to be preserved.": "Bill",

  "The environmental problems of developing countries are not the side effects of excessive industrialisation but reflect the inadequacy of development.": "Indira",

  "No one is an environmentalist by birth. It is only your path, your life, your travels that awaken you.": "Yann",
  "Our globe is under new dramatic environmental pressure: our globe is warming, our ice caps melting, our glaciers receding, our coral is dying, our soils are eroding, our water tables falling, our fisheries are being depleted, our remaining rainforests shrinking. Something is very, very wrong with our eco-system.": "Richard",
  "The environmental effects of the automobile are well known: motor vehicles cause, for example, as much as 75 percent of the noise and 80 percent of the air pollution in our cities, and the industry must face mounting pressure from environmentalists.": "Stewart",
  "Environmental activism against the resource industry is widespread all over the world, but at the same time we have to realise that these are basic materials on which civilisation depends. We need to tap natural resources in a sustainable manner.": "Anil",
  "The growth that we want is one that brings real benefits to the people, raises quality and efficiency of development, and contributes to energy conservation and environmental protection.": "Li",
  "To deal with these problems - of world population and hunger, of peace, of energy and mineral resources, of environmental pollution, of poverty - we must broaden and deepen our knowledge of nature's laws, and we must broaden and deepen our understanding of the laws of human behavior.": "Herbert",
  "If our system continues without modification involving environmental and social concern, we will face an economic and social breakdown of our outdated monetary and political system.": "Jacque",
  "From year to year, environmental changes are incremental and often barely register in our lives, but from evolutionary or geological perspectives, what is happening is explosive change.": "David",
  "The sooner we get started with alternative energy sources and recognize that fossil fuels makes us less secure as a nation, and more dangerous as a planet, the better off we'll be.": "Lindsey",
  "If we want to address global warming, along with the other environmental problems associated with our continued rush to burn our precious fossil fuels as quickly as possible, we must learn to use our resources more wisely, kick our addiction, and quickly start turning to sources of energy that have fewer negative impacts.": "David",

  "The most important environmental issue is one that is rarely mentioned, and that is the lack of a conservation ethic in our culture.": "Gaylord",
  "I've always been a strong supporter of environmental protection and initiatives in that area. But I'm willing to set priorities. If we have to make reductions in one place, we'll have to-in order to increase another place, I'm willing to do that.": "Judd",

  "The Safe Drinking Water Act, the safety provisions of the Clean Water Acts, the Clean Air Act, the Superfund Law - the gas industry is exempt from all these basic environmental and worker protections.

  "The planet's environmental woes tend to be overlooked as we scramble for the latest high-tech gizmos - and conveniently ignore their energy consumption.": "Sheherazade",
  "I think we have grave problems. I am very much concerned about environmental questions, even though in Finnish society, we are not facing the most urgent problems.": "Harri",

  "One of the most important lessons we can glean from the environmental movement is to 'think globally and act locally.'": "Mike",
  "In the rich world, the environmental situation has improved dramatically. In the United States, the most important environmental indicator, particulate air pollution, has been cut by more than half since 1955, rivers and coastal waters have dramatically improved, and forests are increasing.": "Bjorn",
  "The trends that are shaping the twenty-first-century world embody both promise and peril. Globalization, for example, has lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty while contributing to social fragmentation and a massive increase in inequality, not to mention serious environmental damage.": "Klaus",

  "A majority of American citizens are now becoming skeptical of the claim that our carbon footprints, resulting from our use of fossil fuels, are going to lead to climatic calamities. But governments are not yet listening to the citizens.": "John",
  "There is no 'need' for us to eat meat, dairy or eggs. Indeed, these foods are increasingly linked to various human diseases and animal agriculture is an environmental disaster for the planet.": "Gary",
  "Viewed from a holistic ecological perspective, some meat - such as conscientiously hunted animals - involves less suffering and environmental damage than arable agriculture, while both of these are significantly less harmful than indiscriminately purchasing meat on the market.": "Tristram",
  "The goal must be to expand ourselves beyond one field of focus and use our improved access to information to solve the very real and extreme economic, environmental, and resource challenges we face as an interconnected, global society.": "Naveen",

  "We assume that everything's becoming more efficient, and in an immediate sense that's true; our lives are better in many ways. But that improvement has been gained through a massively inefficient use of natural resources.": "Paul",

  "You want to keep the severity of our environmental problems in mind enough to keep yourself motivated but not enough to paralyze you into depression.": "Sara",
  "I have a huge fan following in Bellary, and when they met me, they told me about their problems. I have seen mining done without proper safety measures and not taking environmental protection into account.": "Pawan",
  "Shrimp farms are a scourge on the earth, frankly, from an environmental point of view. They pour huge amounts of pollutants into the ocean. They also pollute their next-door neighbors.": "Jane",
  "I'm a latecomer to the environmental issue, which for years seemed to me like an excuse for more government regulation. But I can see that in rich societies, voters are paying less attention to economic issues and more to issues of the spirit, including the environment.": "David",
  "With the mining sites, I found a subject matter that carried forth my fascination with the undoing of the landscape, in terms of both its formal beauty and its environmental politics.": "David",
  "I thought I was gonna be an attorney, so I went to Dartmouth and I was a government major and I minored in environmental policy, and I didn't do anything academically around the arts.": "Aisha",
  "If people are prepared to eat locally and seasonally, then they probably do pretty well in terms of environmental impact.": "Peter",
  "Toxins love to get you while you're young. Lead, mercury, secondhand smoke and sundry other environmental nasties do a lot more damage when tissue is immature, vulnerable and growing than when it's mature and comparatively fixed.": "Jeffrey",
  "If we're going to pass international trade agreements, as we should, they should have similar kind of rules, not as high a wage as obviously as a steelworker in the U.S. or in Lorain, Ohio, but certainly rules on the environment and worker safety. You go to Mexico, you don't see those kinds of worker protections or environmental safeguards.": "Sherrod",
  "During my travels in Iraq, Israel, Gaza, Brazil, Indonesia, Japan, Europe and all over the United States, I have seen and heard the voices of people who want change. They want the stabilization of the economy, education and healthcare for all, renewable energy and an environmental vision with an eye on generations to come.": "Michael",
  "All too often, the conversation about appropriate and balanced environmental stewardship gets caught up in partisan politics. Yet, this conversation is key to the preservation of our great country for generations to come, as important as ensuring we have fiscally responsible policies to secure our future.": "Chris",
  "I think the environmental problem will be the number one item on the agenda of the 21st century... This is a problem that cannot be postponed.": "Mikhail",
  "The main environmental challenge of the 21st century is poverty. When you don't know where your next meal is coming from, it's hard to consider the environment 100 years down the line.": "Bjorn",
  "The BP spill was the greatest environmental catastrophe in U.S. history. Yet somehow, gas companies like BP and Halliburton ran interference on reporting that story.": "Josh",
  "And I know that the younger generation is doing things that are so ingenious. And for them it's not a matter of a political belief or an environmental stance. It's really just common sense.": "Daryl",
  "All living beings, not just animals, but plants and microorganisms, perceive. To survive, an organic being must perceive - it must seek, or at least recognize, food and avoid environmental danger.": "Lynn",
  "I align myself with almost all researchers in assuming that anything we do is a composite of whatever genetic limitations were given to us by our parents and whatever kinds of environmental opportunities are available.": "Howard",
  "Business has a way of talking about how to create value, which is in some way isn't bad... We just need to start thinking about if the value we want to create is consistent with all social and environmental well being.": "Peter",
  "I hope that in future Congresses there will reemerge a recognition that climate change is a reality, that our policies to meet our energy needs must also deal responsibly with environmental issues, including the damage caused by greenhouse gas emissions.": "Jeff",
  "What we know is that the environmental movement had a series of dazzling victories in the late '60s and in the '70s where the whole legal framework for responding to pollution and to protecting wildlife came into law. It was just victory after victory after victory. And these were what came to be called 'command-and-control' pieces of legislation.": "Naomi",
  "As President Trump quickly moved to limit immigration, civil rights, and environmental protections, I felt fear for my young children, and guilt, too - as if I'd somehow betrayed the unspoken contract all parents make to give our children a better life than ourselves.": "Laura",
  "Congressional Republicans are dismantling the limited environmental protections initiated by Richard Nixon, who would be something of a dangerous radical in today's political scene.": "Noam",
  "There are plenty of problems in the world, and doubtless climate change - or whatever the currently voguish phrase for it all is - certainly is one of them. But it's low on my list.": "P.",
  "I think it makes people in the Pentagon kind of nervous to know that chemical agents and environmental factors could cause so much damage in terms of what may happen in the future.": "Bernie",
  "I see a future where states compete with one another to see which can be the most efficient, and where businesses seek out efficient states in which to locate so they can reap the economic and environmental benefits for their businesses and employees.": "Bernie",
  "It took a generation for companies to recognise their responsibilities in terms of labour practices and another generation for them to recognise their environmental obligations.": "Rebecca",
  "Over the past several decades, a growing number of investors have been choosing to put their money in funds that screen companies for their environmental and labor records. Some socially responsible investors are starting to add free expression and privacy to their list of criteria.": "Rebecca",
  "Without global human rights, labor and environmental movements, companies would still be hiring 12-year-olds as a matter of course and poisoning our groundwater without batting an eyelid.": "Rebecca",
  "I'd been making music that was intended to be like painting, in the sense that it's environmental, without the customary narrative and episodic quality that music normally has. I called this 'ambient music.' But at the same time I was trying to make visual art become more like music, in that it changed the way that music changes.": "Brian",
  "This is absolutely bizarre that we continue to subsidize highways beyond the gasoline tax, airlines, and we don't subsidize, we don't want to subsidize a national rail system that has environmental impact.": "Joe",
  "The Moon stabilizes Earth's obliquity. Well, almost. The tilt actually varies between 22 and 24.5 degrees - and the variation is enough to induce such environmental inconveniences as the occasional ice age. Without the Moon, it might be much worse.": "Seth",
  "We live in a world bathed in 5,000 times more energy than we consume as a species in the year, in the form of solar energy. It's just not in usable form yet.": "Peter",
  "I have voted against only one of President Obama's nominees: Michael Froman, a Citigroup alumnus who is currently storming the halls of Congress as U.S. Trade Representative pushing trade deals that threaten to undermine financial regulation, workers' rights, and environmental protections.": "Elizabeth",
  "The environment has fallen to the wayside in politics.": "Craig",
  "I think future engineered species could be the source of food, hopefully a source of energy, environmental remediation and perhaps replacing the petrochemical industry.": "Craig",
  "You always bump into politics in life, and as a man, I'm party to a number of environmental issues that concern me first and foremost, as a man, as a father.": "Pierce",
  "I always thought we had an environmental problem, but I hadn't realized how urgent it was. James Lovelock writes that by the end of this century there will be one billion people left.": "Vivienne",
  "Economists treat economics as if it is a pure science divorced from the facts of life. The result of this false accountancy is a willful confusion under cover of which industry wreaks its havoc scot-free and ignores the environmental cost.": "Vivienne",
  "It's worth knowing more about the complicated environmental and genetic factors that could explain why traumatic brain injuries lead to long-term disabilities in some people and not in others.": "Anne",
  "Food and the way we grow it and produce it are a major cause of environmental degradation.": "Jose",
  "Many environmental advocates argue that agricultural pollution will be reduced only through stronger federal laws.": "Charles",
  "In the auto industry, there's one thing you can always count on: if a new environmental or safety rule is proposed, executives will prophesy disaster.": "James",
  "The environmental movement doesn't have many deserters and has a high level of recruitment. Eventually, there will be open war.": "Paul",
  "Usually, environmental programs are not designed for a mainstream audience.": "Paul",
  "I've won some awards. 'Time' magazine designated me as one of the environmental heroes of the 20th century. Oh, and I've got some honorary citizenships, like from the Conch Republic of the Florida Keys. But the one thing I am proud of is I didn't get the Chevron environmental award. Never did get that one.": "Paul",
  "I've used the prestige and influence of having been a president of the United States as effectively as possible. And secondly, I've still been able to carry out my commitments to peace and human rights and environmental quality and freedom and democracy and so forth.": "Jimmy",
  "We now see numerous examples of brands working together to address issues such as environmental degradations, climate control, pollution, poverty and disease.": "Simon",
  "When people align around shared political, social, economic or environmental values, and take collective action, thinking and behavior that compromises the lives of millions of people around the world can truly change.": "Simon",
  "I've always been interested in the industrialization of our food it's been an issue for me from an environmental and animal rights and human health perspective. ": "Richard",
  "In the environmental movement, every time you lose a battle it's for good, but our victories always seem to be temporary and we keep fighting them over and over again.": "David",
  "It's not unexpected that shooting massive amounts of water, sand, and chemicals at high pressure into the earth to shatter shale and release natural gas might shake things up. But earthquakes aren't the worst problem with fracking.": "David",
  "Beyond reducing individual use, one of our top priorities must be to move from fossil fuels to energy that has fewer detrimental effects on water supplies and fewer environmental impacts overall.": "David",
  "I always felt that if someone shot me, it would be great for the environmental movement, because they would make me a martyr. Our biggest fear was our children, because there was a tremendous amount of threat and intimidation, and my wife was terrified that the children might be grabbed or assaulted in some way. That was the real fear.": "David",
  "Liberals in Congress have spent the past three decades pandering to environmental extremists. The policies they have put in place are in large part responsible for the energy crunch we are seeing today. We have not built a refinery in this country for 30 years.": "Marsha",
  "It should be noted that the EPA's banning of methanol is categorically absurd from the point of view of environmental protection.": "Robert",
  "From 1859 to 1971, the U.S. oil industry grew virtually continuously, in the process serving mightily to drive our economy and win our wars. But that growth was stopped dead in 1971 and sent into decline thereafter, as the advent of the EPA and the accompanying National Environmental Policy Act made it increasingly difficult to drill.": "Robert",
  "There's every reason to think that whatever their political leanings, Americans will be highly receptive to numerous reforms designed to improve health, safety, economic security, environmental quality and democratic self-government - at least if those reforms do not eliminate their freedom of choice.": "Cass",
  "Just as there's garbage that pollutes the Potomac river, there is garbage polluting our culture. We need an Environmental Protection Agency to clean it up.": "Pat",
  "I feel privileged to be a U.N. ambassador. It gives me an opportunity to use my voice to help raise awareness about important social and environmental issues.": "Gisele",
  "Nature's patterns sometimes reflect two intertwined features: fundamental physical laws and environmental influences. It's nature's version of nature versus nurture.": "Brian",
  "When you buy a jacket, you pick the size to ensure it fits. Similarly, we live in a universe in which the amount of dark energy fits our biological make-up. If the amount of dark energy were substantially different from what we've measured, the environmental conditions would be inhospitable to our form of life.": "Brian",
  "That's the big mistake the environmental movement made - 'We'll scare the hell out of you, and you'll become an activist'.": "Naomi",
  "All we can hope for is that the thing is going to slowly and imperceptibly shift. All I can say is that 50 years ago there were no such thing as environmental policies.": "David",
  "I have been a long-term environmental advocate for the agriculture industry. I have particularly tried to push carbon farming or carbon sequestration.": "Sam",
  "Congress has no business telling courts within a state that they are prohibited from considering issues involving a lease for energy development, production, and exploration that has the potential to cause irreparable environmental and economic damage to the Gulf Coast area of that state.": "Ted",
  "I'm not afraid to spend money on the R&D that's really going to move us to a cleaner energy source that I think is so much the answer to the issues of environmental responsibility and climate change.": "Lisa",
  "If you look at the history of other movements, whether Civil Rights or environmental rights, these are all decades-long undertakings.": "Mitch",
  "I've always thought the main argument for organic was more environmental than a health argument. I just don't think spraying a lot of pesticides into the environment on a routine basis is a good thing.": "John",
  "The NFL, sadly, has a fatal environmental problem: It kills its workers.": "Matt",
  "Many environmental battles are won by delaying a destructive project long enough to change the conversation - to allow new economic, political and social dynamics to emerge.": "Frances",
  "I have long understood that climate change is not only an environmental issue - it is a humanitarian, economic, health, and justice issue as well.": "Frances",
  "When the government undertakes or approves a major project such as a dam or highway project, it must make sure the project's impacts, environmental and otherwise, are considered. In many cases, NEPA gives the public its only opportunity to be heard about the project's impact on their community.": "Frances",
  "What is the future going to say about us now? What are our kids going to look at us and say, 'How could you not stop that person from getting into power? How could you not stop that environmental disaster that you saw coming a mile away?'": "Leslie",
  "The human and environmental devastation caused by nuclear weapons - whether by testing, mistake or malice - is the very reason we need to eliminate them altogether.": "Valerie",
  "Sustainability goes across everything I do with Adidas and everything I do with my own house, so the Olympic kit is no exception. It is incredibly environmental in the way that it is manufactured. For example, there's no leather; it's free from PVC. There's lots of woven materials, which means a lot less waste.": "Stella",
  "I hope my work contributes to understanding long-term patterns of human behavior and how we survive, thrive, or fail during times of environmental, social, and economic crisis.": "Sarah",

  "It's absolutely shameful that Rep. Grijalva would try to use tribes as political pawns to implement the misguided agenda of extremist environmental groups.": "Paul",
  "I took the initiative in moving forward a whole range of initiatives that have proven to be important to our country's economic growth, environmental protection, improvements in our educational system.": "Al",
  "I believe we should reframe our response to climate change as an imperative for growth rather than merely being a way of being green or meeting environmental commitments.": "William",
  "The worst environmental decision you can make as a human being is to have 14 kids.": "Jane",
  "Wouldn't it help Americans more, in the long run, if we were forced to accept some responsibility for the environmental wreckage we prefer to assume is totally out of our control?": "Jane",
  "On the environment and climate change, I suspect that future generations will think there was too much timidity, too much fear of upsetting business. Basically, New Labour was very nervous about regulating business, or requiring it to do anything, even when there was a very clear social or environmental case for doing so.": "Geoff",
  "We know that childhood and adolescence are the most crucial times for environmental stimuli to affect breast cancer risk, but changes made during adulthood and even after diagnosis still have the potential to create positive changes in the body.": "Joel",
  "I think there's a green side to John Kerry, if you like, that he's an environmental activist. His record on the environment is as best as you have on a pro-environment record of anybody in the U.S. Senate.": "Douglas",
  "Environmental spending creates jobs in engineering, manufacturing, construction, materials, operations and maintenance.": "Keith",
  "Our land-healing ministry really is about cultivating relationships: between the people, the loving stewards, and the ecology of a place, what I call the environmental umbilical that we're nurturing here.": "Joel",
  "It really disturbs me that the environmental movement has been co-opted by creation-worshippers instead of being encouraged by the Creator-worshippers.": "Joel",
  "Americans don't pay much attention to environmental issues, because they aren't sexy. I mean, cleaning up coal plants and reining in outlaw frackers is hugely important work, but it doesn't get anybody's pulse racing.": "Jeff",
  "Mark Ruffalo, aka the Incredible Hulk, is the natural gas industry's worst nightmare: a serious, committed activist who is determined to use his star power as a superhero in the hottest movie of the moment to draw attention the environmental and public health risks of fracking.": "Jeff",
  "Have we failed to slow global warming pollution in part because climate and environmental activists have been too polite and well behaved?": "Jeff",
  "It is a world of extremes, which can be characterised most clearly in terms of exclusion. That means political exclusion, whereby the rights of citizens are marginalised by the interests of big business: George W Bush's environmental policy, for example, is clearly formulated in the interests of U.S. energy companies.": "Noreena",
  "As fears about the energy and environmental crises reach a fever pitch, we're all searching for solutions. And one possibility is that we could fix everything if we'd just shrink our population back down to about 2 billion people - which would put us roughly where we were at 80 years ago.": "Annalee",
  "The Keystone pipeline is one of those things that's sort of a political driver. And mostly, the Republicans use it to sort of embarrass the president and embarrass quite a few Democrats who feel that there's a potential for an environmental disaster.": "Rodney",
  "There's a myth out there that you have to genuflect at the altar of quarterly earnings. But it's a false choice that you can either be a good fiduciary or promote values such as environmental sustainability.": "Thomas",
  "We have a project with Unocal here in Los Angeles, where we as an environmental organization, the oil company, and the state all get together to promote the recycling of used motor oil.": "Ted",
  "The environmental movement, like all political processes, reacts best to disasters. But these are very slow, very gradual disasters in the making.": "Ted",
  "Address these environmental issues and you will address every issue known to man. And we keep dabbling in things that aren't really that important in the long term.": "Ted",
  "We must not risk defunding environmental conservation programs, which is why Congress should reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund to preserve our natural resources.": "Suzan",
  "As I have said all along, for any trade promotion authority bill to gain my support, it must require strong, enforceable environmental and labor protections.": "Suzan",
  "I've been active in animal rights and all kinds of environmental stuff and children's charities over the years.": "Martina",
  "I think Captain Cousteau might be the father of the environmental movement.": "Ted",
  "Nature is not simply a technical or economical resource, and human beings are not mere numbers. To suggest that one can somehow align all the squabbling institutions of science, environmental management, government and diplomacy in an alliance of convenience to regulate the global climate seems to me optimistic.": "James",
  "People who run environmental groups and things like that, who have to listen to all kinds of nonsense and keep their tempers, are very diplomatic and very inclusive.": "Sigourney",
  "Ever since we achieved a breakthrough in the area of recombinant DNA in 1973, left-wing nuts and environmental kooks have been screaming that we will create some kind of Frankenstein bug or Andromeda Strain that will destroy us all.": "James",
  "I've had filmmakers, I even had Bono come and talk to me about having a sequel to 'E.T.' help with an environmental message - I listened. I can certainly understand. I mean, the great thing about Bono is that everything he does is in service to a greater cause.": "Kathleen",
  "Computer programmers, biotechnologists, environmental scientists, neuroscientists, nanotech engineers - all of these fields, and more, should have at least a course in ethics as part of their degree requirements.": "Jamais",
  "We are now heading down a centuries-long path toward increasing the productivity of our natural capital - the resource systems upon which we depend to live - instead of our human capital.": "Paul",
  "I think an old style of addressing environmental problems is ebbing, but the rise of the so-called conservative, political movement in this country is not a trend towards the future but a reaction to this very broad shift that we are undergoing.": "Paul",
  "For too much of history, we've viewed the world's precious resources - both environmental and human - as things to extract, to make the most of in order to maximize their potential.": "Jacqueline",
  "I call upon governments to start supporting companies to use more sustainable materials in their products instead of continuing with antiquated incentives, such as import duties on synthetic materials that are in principle much higher compared with those placed on leather goods regardless of the environmental footprint.": "Jochen",
  "Let's recreate the equivalent of the Met Ball in Europe and, rather than for the museum, give the money to environmental causes.": "Jochen",
  "There is the GIS world that is largely managing authoritative data sources, supporting geocentric workflows like fixing roads, making cities more livable through better planning, environmental management, forest management, drilling in the right location for oil, managing assets and utilities.": "Jack",
  "On almost every environmental issue I care about, in fact, I've been wrong at one point or another. I used to think that climate change was no big deal, that most environmental problems were massive exaggerations, that oil reserves were effectively unlimited, and more.": "Ramez",

  "There's a value in used electronic equipment, and currently, there are small, domestic recyclers that process this equipment safely. But they have a hard time competing with facilities overseas that have few, if any, environmental and safety standards.": "Gene",
  "The Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), which controls the living environment on shuttles and on the International Space Station, doesn't have the luxury of disposal: discharging trash into space has long been judged a bad idea.": "Rose",
  "The industrial processes in use today were developed at a time when no one had to consider what the environmental impact was. Who cared? But making ecological concerns matter to a company's bottom line will help it do the research and development that will reinvent everything we buy.": "Daniel",
  "Smog is affecting larger parts of China, and environmental pollution has become a major problem, which is nature's red-light warning against the model of inefficient and blind development.": "Li",
  "It is the public that is illiterate in science and math, a lazy press, and environmental advocacy groups that manufacture fear for misconceptions about energy.": "Rex",
  "Brands who come to China, often they just care about price - so they actually drive the suppliers to cut corners on environmental standards to win a contract.": "Ma",
  "The motivation should come from regulatory enforcement, but enforcement is weak, and environmental litigation is near to impossible. So there's an urgent need for extensive public participation to generate another kind of motivation.": "Ma",
  "China has leapfrogged into this information age, and Web users have grown very significantly, which knocked down the cost of doing the environmental transparency.": "Ma",
  "In America, you complain about job losses because of China, but here, we carry all of the environmental costs.": "Ma",
  "Environmental problems cannot be resolved here the way they are resolved in other countries. I heard that 80 per cent of the environmental problems in the U.S. are solved in court. That can't happen here.": "Ma",
  "On April 16, 2010, 34 Chinese environmental organizations, including Friends of Nature, the Institute of Public and Environmental Affairs, and Green Beagle, questioned heavy metal pollution in a letter sent to CEO Steve Jobs.": "Ma",
  "If major companies sourcing in developing countries care only about price and quality, local suppliers will be lured to cut corners on environmental standards to win contracts.": "Ma",
  "China leads the world in energy consumption, carbon emissions, and the release of major air and water pollutants, and the environmental impact is felt both regionally and globally.": "Ma",
  "It has been shown that public participation can limit powerful interest groups, while competing interests can help find a reasonable balance between development and environmental protection.": "Ma",
  "China's environmental conundrums will not be solved by changes within government alone. New mechanisms are needed to allow the communities which may be affected by a given plan, and citizens concerned about the environment, to join in.": "Ma",
  "Environmental agencies in China are hamstrung by local officials who put economic growth ahead of environmental protection; even the courts are beholden to local officials, and they are not open to environmental litigation.": "Ma",
  "We must strictly enforce the Environmental Law, closing down the polluters that fail to meet the standards.": "Ma",
  "China is bearing the environmental cost for much of the world because China is the factory of the world.": "Ma",
  "Urban residents, most of them middle class, have a much better sense of their environmental rights, and they're willing to take to the streets.": "Ma",
  "If China is helping its domestic industries charge an artificially low price for solar panels and other environmental goods, then China is violating international trade rules that it agreed to when it became a member of the World Trade Organization.": "Ron",

  "For the U.S., I think we should have a carbon tax, for environmental reasons.": "Tyler",
  "The way to make the world a better place, through your eating, is simply to eat a bit less meat. Local is sometimes good, sometimes bad. But even when it's good, its environmental impact is relatively small compared to other possible improvements.": "Tyler",
  "A knowledgeable and courageous U.S. president could help enormously in leading the world's nations toward saving the climate.": "Donella",
  "Like the other great revolutions, an environmental revolution will require sacrifices and lead to enormous gains. It, too, will change the face of the land and human institutions, hierarchies, self-definitions, cultures. It will take centuries. If it happens. There is no guarantee, of course.": "Donella",
  "Fossil fuels and mining is a short-term gambit. If we develop those resources at the expense of the environmental gold mine that is the Great Barrier Reef, we will all lose in the long run.": "Philippe",
  "With EarthEcho Expedition: Acid Apocalypse, we are working with youth leaders and noted experts on the changing chemistry of our ocean to help illuminate one of our most pressing and inscrutable environmental issues.": "Philippe",

  "Helping people understand the impact of key environmental and human issues worldwide is something that I'm passionate about. CNN's 'Going Green' series of specials are engaging viewers around the world through important messages of conservation and hope.": "Philippe",
  "Truly, we do live on a 'water planet.' For us, water is that critical issue that we need. It's the most precious substance on the planet, and it links us to pretty much every environmental issue, including climate change, that we're facing.": "Philippe",
  "I believe very strongly that corporations could and should be a major force for resolving social and environmental concerns in the twenty-first century.": "William",
  "There's a rising tide of environmental awareness and activism among consumers that's going to continue to swell in the 21st century. Smart companies will get ahead of that wave and ride it to success and prosperity. Those that don't are headed for a wipeout.": "William",
  "Climate change is not a discrete issue; it's a symptom of larger problems. Fundamentally, our society as currently designed has no future. We're chewing up the planet so fast, in so many different ways, that we could solve the climate problem tomorrow and still find that environmental collapse is imminent.": "Alex",
  "Fracking has been used for more than 60 years to successfully drill over a million oil and gas wells in the U.S. Nonetheless, the prevailing mythology on the radical left is that the technology is 'poisoning our children' by polluting the water we drink and the air we breathe.": "Bob",
  "China will soon emit more greenhouse gases than America, but its regime knows if it caps aspirations there will be a revolution.": "James",
  "At every turn, when humanity is asked the question, 'Do you want temporary economic gain or long-term environmental loss, which one do you prefer,' we invariably choose the money.": "Ethan",
  "I have heard over and over again that the drilling business is a dangerous business, and death is an expected part of the game, but I've also heard of the way that safety violations, human and environmental laws, and a concern for the local culture are flaunted in pursuit of money.": "Alexandra",
  "What is basically just an IQ score has roots in education, socioeconomic status, genetics, and environmental factors. Looking at any one of these roots doesn't give you a full picture of the tree, but it does tell you that a tree is there.": "Kyle",
  "The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality - what a joke. In my district, we caught them lying to us about the results of air quality studies in the Barnett Shale. They are playing with the health and safety of our communities, and we are going to tell them that is not acceptable.": "Wendy",
  "I'd say that animal rights and environmental issues have always been at the forefront of my mind.": "Corey",
  "Natural gas is a better transportation fuel than gasoline, so if that's the case, it's cheaper, it's cleaner and it's a domestic resource.": "T.",
  "The cheapest natural gas in the world is in the United States.": "T.",
  "I don't think it's too hippie to want to clean up the planet so you don't wind up dying of some kind of cancer when you're 45 years old. It enrages me that these big cancer-research organizations can't be bothered to man the front lines of environmental protest.": "Jello",
  "I don't know if acting is genetic. Maybe it's environmental.": "Freddie",
  "Environmental pollution, terrorism, and many other global threats do not stop at borders. We all bear global responsibility and thus need a global identity to enable us to cope with them. We must learn to integrate different levels of identity in ourselves. What matters is not either/or, but both/and.": "Klaus",
  "I do believe very strongly that all of us and all of the other things in the context of our planet with Mother Nature, all of these things absolutely have a profound effect.": "Kiefer",
  "I don't see this planet being... they're talking about how they're turning around the environmental problems here, but I think it's already too late.": "Ace",
  "To avoid congestion, I get up at 5:10, grab a slice of raisin toast, and leave the house at 6 A.M. My husband, Tim Dunn, who works for an environmental agency, is still asleep when I slip out, and I find that rather annoying.": "Ellen",
  "And secondly, I would impose a significant state landfill tipping fee and use that tipping fee to fund the billion dollar bond issue that I want to create to produce the funds for all of the environmental challenges that we just went over.": "Ed",
  "The whole environmental policy in the Netherlands has no substance any more.": "Pim",
  "We have no reason to think that climate change is harmful if you look at the world as a whole. Most places, in fact, are better off being warmer than being colder. And historically, the really bad times for the environment and for people have been the cold periods rather than the warm periods.": "Freeman",
  "For me, adventures are a vehicle for travelling deep into the fabric of society, coming to know the environmental conditions that shape people's lives and viewing the present in the context of history.": "Tim",
  "GM has never been about feeding the world or tackling environmental problems. It is and has always been about control of the global food economy by a tiny handful of giant corporations. It's not wicked to question that process. It is wicked not to.": "Zac",
  "We always hear from newspapers that while people understand the environmental challenge, they are unwilling to stomach the solutions. The trouble is, we only ever hear about the solutions from the media, and for whatever reason, they are almost always caricatured beyond recognition. If there's no appetite for green, it's not surprising.": "Zac",
  "By uploading 40 years of 'Ecologist' editions online, we will be creating the world's most extensive ecological archive. 'The Ecologist' will continue to set the environmental and political agenda here and abroad.": "Zac",
  "Politics colours everything, and anyone who wants change is necessarily political. As an environmental campaigner more or less since I left school in the early '90s, I have always been involved in lobbying, campaigning and pushing for changes.": "Zac",
  "'Green' is likely to be a big issue in the 2008 U.S. presidential election - largely in response to George Bush's suicidal refusal to engage with environmental issues.": "Zac",
  "New Zealand needs to balance its environmental responsibilities with its economic opportunities, because the risk is that if you don't do that - and you want to lead the world - then you might end up getting unintended consequences.": "John",
  "What we mean by an outcome will naturally depend on the context. Thus, for a government charged with delivering public goods, an outcome will consist of the quantities provided of such goods as intercity highways, national defense and security, environmental protection, and public education together with the arrangements by which they are financed.": "Eric",
  "Earth Day 1970 was irrefutable evidence that the American people understood the environmental threat and wanted action to resolve it.": "Barry",
  "The wave of new productive enterprises would provide opportunities to remedy the unjust distribution of environmental hazards among economic classes and racial and ethnic communities.": "Barry",
  "The environmental crisis arises from a fundamental fault: our systems of production - in industry, agriculture, energy and transportation - essential as they are, make people sick and die.": "Barry",
  "By adopting the control strategy, the nation's environmental program has created a built-in antagonism between environmental quality and economic growth.": "Barry",
  "What I have experienced over time is that environmental problems are easier to deal with in ways that don't go into their interconnections to the rest of what we are.": "Barry",
  "I find the parallels between how some investors refuse to recognise the trends and our reaction to some of our environmental challenges very powerful. There is an unwillingness to process unpleasant data.": "Jeremy",
  "I am on the board of corporations who contribute both to environmental problems and their solutions. And I am on the NGO side: the Earth Council and other organizations.": "Maurice",
  "One of the things that I've always thought I would like to do is to develop an environmental index. Then people can measure their own environmental performance on an index as they do in other ways.": "Maurice",
  "Ted Turner is still a leader. And he sets a great example. His ability financially has been reduced, but his influence and his example still is an important asset to the whole environmental movement.": "Maurice",
  "I want to work on environmental issues.": "Jimmy",
  "Why should we not expect self-designated environmental leaders to practice what they preach?": "David",
  "You name it - it is something every day from the Environmental Protection Agency, and every group I talk to is the same message: 'Please stop them. Please stop.'": "Stephen",
  "There is no place where we can safely store worn-out reactors or their garbage. No place!": "David",

  "I decided that now is the time to start doing the things that really interest me and I find important. It was in the 10 years of the MacArthur grant that I began working on my first book... and I began putting more work into environmental history.": "Jared",
  "Federal elections happen every two years in this country. Presidential elections every four years. And four years just isn't long enough to dismantle all the environmental laws we've got in this country.": "Jared",
  "Lady Bird Johnson did more than plant flowers in public places. She served the country superbly by planting environmental values in the minds of the nation's leaders and citizens.": "Stewart",
  "If you cut down a forest, it doesn't matter how many sawmills you have if there are no more trees.": "Susan",
  "There's so many issues tied to the meat industry. I mean, social, environmental, humanitarian - all of them. I know that when I'm eating that I'm not hurting the planet, I'm not hurting other people on this planet, I'm not hurting animals... and I'm not hurting nature.": "Maggie",
  "I don't know anything about propaganda for Chinese reunification. I only know about charity and environmental work. I just want to do good.": "Chen",
  "There are nuclear weapons in China, Iran, Korea and Pakistan. It wouldn't take much to send a couple of warheads off on this planet somewhere that would cause a lot of environmental damage, then if you have got someone who wants to retaliate you have real problems.": "Edward",
  "I don't think we're going to save anything if we go around talking about saving plants and animals only we've got to translate that into what's in it for us. ": "Jim",

  "Maintaining healthy forests is essential to those who make a living from the land and for those of us who use them for recreational purposes.": "Cathy",
  "At the same time the folk boom was happening, the civil rights movement was happening, the anti-war movement was happening, the ban the bomb movement was happening, the environmental movement was happening. There was suddenly a generation ready to change the course of history.": "Arlo",
  "Energy cogeneration on Capitol Hill makes economic and environmental sense and should be pursued for those reasons.": "Ander",
  "Vegetarians have been around for a very long time - Pythagoreans forbade eating animals more than 2,500 years ago - but even as the environmental evidence mounted, they didn't appear to be winning the argument.": "Tristram",
  "It is all very well for 2% of the population to live in a monastic state of meatlessness while everyone else gorges their way towards environmental meltdown or the nearest heart clinic. Vegetarianism is good for the willing minority, but not much use as a campaign tool.": "Tristram",
  "Determining the value of individual texts has been an ideological scuffle in literary criticism for centuries: but the environmental cost of printing them hauls this dispute from the ivory tower into day-to-day decision-making. Is it right to write? The publishing industry is slowly beginning to commit to using sustainably harvested trees.": "Tristram",
  "Our work on light bulbs wasn't an arbitrary mandate. We didn't just pick a standard out of the air, or look for a catchy sounding standard like 25 by 2025 not based in science or feasibility. Instead, we worked with both industry and environmental groups to come up with a standard that made sense and was doable.": "Fred",
  "Without international participation, jobs and emissions will simply shift overseas to countries that require few, if any, environmental protections, harming the global environment as well as the U.S. economy.": "Fred",
  "More than ever before, there is a global understanding that long-term social, economic, and environmental development would be impossible without healthy families, communities, and countries.": "Gro",
  "I reflect back 35 years ago, and look how far we have come in America with our environmental policy to improve the conditions of our air and water, and we have had some real successes.": "Jay",
  "We had some major successes and we did so because the country embraced the spirit of Earth Day and embraced this concept that we have to have forward-looking, visionary environmental policy and energy policy in this country.": "Jay",
  "In this country, the health concerns and the environmental concerns are as deep as in Europe. All the surveys show that. But here, we didn't have the cultural dimension. This is a fast-food culture.": "Jeremy",
  "The position I took at the time was that we hadn't really examined any of the potential environmental consequences of introducing genetically modified organisms.": "Jeremy",
  "We can have technology, prosperity, nice homes and cars, but at the same time we must be conscious of what we are dumping into the water, the air and our food.": "Kevin",
  "I wanted to help raise awareness, so I created an environmental foundation called Just Within Reach.": "Kevin",
  "Unless we keep this planet healthy, everything else is for naught.": "Victoria",
  "There is a new wave of environmental consumers I like to call Pocketbook Environmentalists. They're going green primarily because it makes good financial sense, but the fact that it benefits their families' health and the environment also makes them feel good.": "Lynn",
  "With the observable fact that scientific knowledge makes our lives better when applied with concern for human welfare and environmental protection, there is no question that science and technology can produce abundance so that no one has to go without.": "Jacque",
  "I was surprised to see how much the mainstream environmental movement hates the ELF.": "Marshall",
  "I have a pretty positive view of environmental activism, but I didn't know much about the ELF. A lot of people make documentaries because they have something they want to say, but I make them because there's something I want to explore.": "Marshall",
  "I've been a philanthropist for all my life, and... I've had many involvements in humanitarian and environmental issues.": "Julian",
  "We'll continue to see more and more brands integrate social causes, charitable components and environmental issues as underlying themes to their campaigns and messaging. Humans connect with humans after all, and brands are using this as a point of connection to engage with their audience, especially charity-minded Generation Y.": "Amy",
  "Under the Environmental Protection Agency's Energy Star Program, homes are independently verified to be measurably more energy efficient than average houses.": "Melissa",
  "A fascinating challenge facing today's environmental movement is how to best approach the reversal of past decisions that altered once-pristine environmental spaces for the sake of urgent man-made needs.": "Matt",
  "Some types of environmental restoration projects are well-known; restored wetlands, for instance, or coal mine reclamation projects. Recently though, larger dam removal projects have started, a number of them in Washington state.": "Matt",
  "On the environmental front there's concern about global warming and high levels of carbon dioxide, and trees take in CO2 and store carbon.": "Clive",
  "I don't know of a single park without serious environmental problems.": "Michael",
  "The high prices also highlight the fact that the U.S. is too heavily dependent on fossil fuels that we import from unstable parts of the world. To protect our national security, we must become more energy secure.": "Dan",
  "The environmental benefits of hydrogen are also outstanding. When used as an energy source, hydrogen produces no emissions besides water. Zero polluting emissions, an amazing advance over the current sources of energy that we use.": "Dan",
  "Hydrogen holds great promise to meet many of our future energy needs, and it addresses national security and our environmental concerns. Hydrogen is the simplest, most abundant element in the universe.": "Dan",
  "Why are ecologists and environmentalists so feared and hated? This is because in part what they have to say is new to the general public, and the new is always alarming.": "Garrett",
  "Moreover, the practical recommendations deduced from ecological principles threaten the vested interests of commerce; it is hardly surprising that the financial and political power created by these investments should be used sometimes to suppress environmental impact studies.": "Garrett",
  "I'm very concerned for the future of the earth and its amazing creatures. We've got to be careful and make sure we don't foul our own nest.": "John",
  "If we talk about the environment, for example, we have to talk about environmental racism - about the fact that kids in South Central Los Angeles have a third of the lung capacity of kids in Santa Monica.": "Danny",
  "The irony of environmental opposition to the Keystone XL project is that stopping the pipeline to the U.S. will not stop production in the oil sands of Canada. Instead of coming to the United States, the oil will still be produced and shipped by rail or a pipeline similar to the Keystone XL to Canada's Pacific Coast.": "John",
  "We learned that economic growth and environmental protection can and should go hand in hand.": "Christopher",
  "Unless action is taken soon - unless we can display the same vision of that earlier period - we will lose the treasure of California's open space and environmental beauty.": "Adam",
  "The Body Shop Foundation is run by our staff and supports social activism and environmental activism. We don't tend to support big agencies.": "Anita",
  "Religious and spiritual leaders should be held accountable for environmental activism, not only because they have access to large communities and can influence votes, but because service is integral to religious and spiritual life.": "Radhanath",
  "Businesses can lead with their values and make money, too. You don't have to simply be purely profit-driven. You can integrate social and environmental concerns into a business, be a caring business, be a generous business and still do very well financially.": "Jerry",
  "Look at your business and the activities that you undertake. Then, start to think about not just your economic concerns, but about social and environmental impacts that businesses have.": "Jerry",
  "I think the government has to reposition environment on top of their national and international priorities.": "Brian",
  "We created the Cabinet Committee on the Environment to review the environmental implications of all government initiatives. I think what made us successful was the fact that it was a sustained approach. We did something new every year.": "Brian",
  "There is no question that photography has played a major role in the environmental movement.": "Galen",
  "These days, most nature photographers are deeply committed to the environmental message.": "Galen",
  "There is no larger collective-action problem than the environment. The three biggest lies of the environmental movement is that every little bit helps, you can do your part, and together we can do it.": "Clay",
  "This Nation has realized significant environmental improvements over the last three decades.": "Jerry",
  "Like I said, I'm more worried long term about the environmental issues then the use of arms.": "Hans",

  "I had never been able to get a car that said how much I cared about the environment until I drove electric.": "Alexandra",
  "My idea of an amusement park story is getting adventurers to go tour environmental disaster areas. After all, if the entire Great Barrier Reef gets killed, which seems like an extremely lively possibility, what are you going to do with all that rotting limestone?": "Bruce",
  "I assume we will have figured out a way to efficiently utilize solar energy and tied that to an efficient way to use nuclear energy in such a way that it doesn't pose a serious environmental issue.": "John",

  "I always knew that I was going be an environmental advocate when I was very young.": "Robert",
  "It's obvious nonsense, but it makes nice people feel good about themselves to do their bit for the planet.

  "Individual rights are the means of subordinating society to moral law.": "Ayn",
  "My favorite records are, like, The Pretty Things' 'Parachute' and 'S.F. Sorrow' and The Mothers of Invention's 'We're Only in It for the Money' and The Kinks' 'Village Green Preservation Society' - these records that have a story - even if it's not a literal story - because of how they're sequenced and flow. It's like a novel with sound.": "Ty",
  "The first thing to improve society is not banning abortion, but making sure that everyone who had a child is in the best position to be able to rear it.": "Caitlin",
  "The question is not, will there be difficulties and threats to our existence, but how will we deal with them and what can we learn from them. How can they become blessings to society, as a life threatening disease is to an individual, by teaching us about the meaning of our life and existence?": "Bernie",
  "America's criminal justice system isn't known for rehabilitation. I'm not sure that, as a society, we are even interested in that concept anymore.": "Steve",
  "Professionalism is not sportsmanship. If you don't succeed, you won't be in your profession for long. In our society, it's not about good or bad. It's about who's on top.": "Chili",

  "We are in the society of the teacher-judge, the doctor-judge, the educator-judge, the 'social-worker'-judge; it is on them that the universal reign of the normative is based; and each individual, wherever he may find himself, subjects to it his body, his gestures, his behavior, his aptitudes, his achievements.": "Michel",

  "Tremendous amounts of talent are lost to our society just because that talent wears a skirt.": "Shirley",
  "If a person is homosexual by nature - that is, if one's sexuality is as intrinsic a part of one's identity as gender or skin color - then society can no more deny a gay person access to the secular rights and religious sacraments because of his homosexuality than it can reinstate Jim Crow.": "Jon",
  "A rat race is for rats. We're not rats. We're human beings. Reject the insidious pressures in society that would blunt your critical faculties to all that is happening around you, that would caution silence in the face of injustice lest you jeopardise your chances of promotion and self-advancement.": "Jimmy",
  "When a society is stressed, when it comes up against things that are hard to understand, you get a lot of delusional thinking.": "James",

  "If you let society and your peers define who you are, you're the less for it.": "Hugh",
  "No matter how civilized we are and how much society has curbed violent behavior. Human beings still have the same genes they had 10,000 years ago. Our bodies are designed to have a certain amount of physical stress and violence in them. We're designed to run from jaguars and fight to defend our territory.": "Joe",
  "You cannot reform your society or institution without opening your mind.": "Bashar",
  "My fellow Americans, you have to decide what kind of country you want to live in. If you want a you're on your own, winner take all society you should support the Republican ticket. If you want a country of shared opportunities and shared responsibilities - a 'we're all in it together' society, you should vote for Barack Obama and Joe Biden.": "William",
  "If you ask an economist what's driven economic growth, it's been major advances in things that mattered - the mechanization of farming, mass manufacturing, things like that. The problem is, our society is not organized around doing that.": "Larry",

  "At its most basic the democratic contract is a simple one: the right to vote comes with a responsibility to society, through tax payments and citizenship.": "Lucy",
  "In return, society rewards those who give it what it wants. That is why how much money people have earned is a rough measure of how much they gave society what it wanted.": "Ray",

  "I've always been tremendously interested in criminal law. It goes to a deep interest I have in prisons and the criminal element, and what we do as a society with it. I've always been touched by the idea of criminality.": "Elizabeth",
  "The big problem of our modern society is that we feel that we are separated from the nature. But it's just the opposite. We are interrelated and our DNA is the same. And only when human beings understand that, the nature will not be obstacle.": "Marina",
  "I've begun to look at the world through apocalypse eyes. Our society, which seems so sturdily built out of concrete and custom, is just a temporary resting place, a hotel our civilization checked into a couple hundred years ago and must one day check out of.": "Neil",

  "I think nowadays, women are breaking the borders or the boundaries and also trying to give a new interpretation in terms of impact you can have to the society.": "Yang",
  "The individual can maintain himself in a society definitely organized only through possessing an equally definite mental and moral constitution. This is what the neuropath lacks. His state of disturbance causes him to be constantly taken by surprise by circumstances.": "Emile",

  "When girls are educated, you get effects that cascade throughout society.": "Queen",

  "Of course, giving is deeply emotional. But supplementing emotion with research makes it more likely that a gift can have a bigger impact. It's like any investment. After all, you wouldn't put funds into stocks or bonds without understanding the potential return. Why wouldn't you do the same when investing in society?": "Laura",
  "White folks, no matter how well-meaning or open-minded, have no true idea what it's like to be black in America. That's not a slam against white people or an accusation of latent bigotry. But the fact is that we all live in an Anglo-dominated society.": "John",
  "Homer, Hesiod, Pythagoras, Plato, and Cicero, just to name a few, all lived in pagan societies. Some of the greatest political and military leaders of all time, such as Alexander the Great, Pericles of Athens, Hannibal of Carthage, and Julius Caesar of Rome, were all pagans, or else living in a pagan society.": "Brendan",
  "The Civil Rights Act of 1964 laid the foundation for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, but it also addressed nearly every other aspect of daily life in a would-be free democratic society.": "Aberjhani",

  "The human mind is a dramatic structure in itself and our society is absolutely saturated with drama.": "Edward",
  "Every teenager deals in his or her own sexuality and has to face it and figure out how it can coincide with the rest of their lives in a healthy manner. And try to navigate it in our modern society, which is wrought with stigma and taboo and repression, and sort of as a result, these inner monsters that some teenagers really struggle with.": "Ezra",
  "We live in an image society. Speeches are not what anybody cares about what they care about is the picture. ": "Madeleine",
  "For blacks in our society, victimization may be a true issue. But it isn't a true issue for women. Neither men nor women are victimized. The true issue, that I try to point out, is that both sexes suffer restricted roles.": "Warren",

  "Courts of law, and all the paraphernalia and folly of law cannot be found in a rational state of society.": "Robert",
  "To cut short the question of the law of retaliation, we must note that even in its primitive form it can operate only between two individuals of whom one is absolutely innocent, and the other absolutely guilty.

  "Bigotry or prejudice in any form is more than a problem it is a deep-seated evil within our society. ": "Judith",

  "I think right now the way society's going, I think role models are important, and kids need direction. If I didn't have that direction growing up, who knows what I could be doing, because I've been lost many times in my life, and I've had to have someone guide me back on the right path.": "Jeremy",
  "Somehow our society has formed a one-sided view of the human personality, and for some reason everyone understood giftedness and talent only as it applied to the intellect. But it is possible not only to be talented in one's thoughts but also to be talented in one's feelings as well.": "Lev",
  "In just about every area of society, there's nothing more important than ethics.": "Henry",

  "How a society treats its disabled is the true measure of a civilization.": "Chen",

  "One of the main lessons I have learned the last five years as Secretary-General is that the United Nations cannot function properly without the support of the business community and civil society.

  "The fact is that censorship always defeats its own purpose, for it creates, in the end, the kind of society that is incapable of exercising real discretion.": "Henry",
  "The implementation of autonomous driving needs a whole new rethinking. To really make it an attribute for society, we really need to think differently about where and when and how we implement this.": "Henrik",
  "I don't know if high society is different in other cities, but in Hollywood, important people can't stand to be invited someplace that isn't full of other important people. They don't mind a few unfamous people being present because they make good listeners.": "Marilyn",
  "Progress is measured by the degree of differentiation within a society.": "Herbert",

  "If we don't preserve the natural resources, you aren't going to have a sustainable society. This is not something for Chez Panisse and the elite of San Francisco. It's for everyone.": "Alice",
  "Rules governing defecation, hygiene, and pollution exist in every culture at every period in history. It may in fact be the foundation of civilization: What is toilet training if not the first attempt to turn a child into an acceptable member of society?": "Rose",
  "The human race's prospects of survival were considerably better when we were defenceless against tigers than they are today when we have become defenceless against ourselves.": "Arnold",

  "There is no higher value in our society than integrity.": "Arlen",
  "The further human society drifts away from nature, the less we understand interdependence.": "Peter",
  "A society should never become like a pond with stagnant water, without movement. That's the most important thing.": "Mikhail",
  "When a nation goes down, or a society perishes, one condition may always be found; they forgot where they came from. They lost sight of what had brought them along.": "Carl",
  "Nine-tenths of the people were created so you would want to be with the other tenth.": "Horace",
  "Society cares for the individual only so far as he is profitable.": "Simone",

  "The true meaning of feminism is this: to use your strong womanly image to gain strong results in society.": "Pamela",
  "I'm interested in that drive, that rush to judgment, that is so prevalent in our society. We all know that pleasurable rush that comes from condemning, and in the short term it's quite a satisfying thing to do, isn't it?": "J.",
  "It may sound too good to be true, but once you've seen the happiest people in your life who have nothing, you really start rethinking what the world, and society, tells us that we need to be happy.": "Blake",
  "Unless you are willing to compromise, society cannot live together.": "Alan",
  "Immorality, violence, and divorce, with their accompanying sorrows, plague society worldwide.": "Joseph",
  "The Republican Party is doubling down on this trickle-down theory that says, 'Thou shalt concentrate wealth at the very top of our society. Thou shalt remove regulation from wherever you find it, even on Wall Street. And thou shalt keep wages low for American workers so that we can be more competitive.'": "Martin",
  "I guess there was a little bit of a slight rebellion, maybe a little bit of a renegade desire that made me realize at some point in my adolescence that I really liked pictures that told stories of things - genre paintings, historical paintings - the sort of derivatives we get in contemporary society.": "Kara",
  "I believe that, if managed well, the Fourth Industrial Revolution can bring a new cultural renaissance, which will make us feel part of something much larger than ourselves: a true global civilization. I believe the changes that will sweep through society can provide a more inclusive, sustainable and harmonious society. But it will not come easily.": "Klaus",
  "Historians and archaeologists will one day discover that the ads of our time are the richest and most faithful reflections that any society ever made of its entire range of activities.": "Marshall",
  "Society drives people crazy with lust and calls it advertising.": "John",
  "Nothing seems at first sight less important than the outward form of human actions, yet there is nothing upon which men set more store: they grow used to everything except to living in a society which has not their own manners.": "Alexis",
  "Who ever hears of fat men heading a riot, or herding together in turbulent mobs? No - no, your lean, hungry men who are continually worrying society, and setting the whole community by the ears.": "Washington",
  "Ideology... is indispensable in any society if men are to be formed, transformed and equipped to respond to the demands of their conditions of existence.": "Louis",
  "I think to a certain extent in Bosnia and among the Hutus in Rwanda and also among the Tutsis in Rwanda who then took revenge on the Hutus, there is a sense of being swept up and a sense that the society in which they live has gone mad.": "John",
  "The Fairness Project is endeavoring to try to do what we can to make a fairer society.": "Mike",
  "Intellectual property is an important legal and cultural issue. Society as a whole has complex issues to face here: private ownership vs. open source, and so on.": "Tim",
  "Travel and society polish one, but a rolling stone gathers no moss, and a little moss is a good thing on a man.": "John",
  "If a test of civilization be sought, none can be so sure as the condition of that half of society over which the other half has power.": "Harriet",

  "I do earnestly wish to see the distinction of sex confounded in society, unless where love animates the behaviour.": "Mary",
  "I do feel like I have always, in my life, been inclined to be on the outside, walk a different path or something. Because of that, and increasingly over the years, my sense of distance from mainstream society or from the way culture works, I have a different kind of perception of it.": "Ian",
  "If you allow for a purely capitalistic society, without any type of regulation at all, you will get one monopoly that will eat all of the smaller fish and own everything, and then you'll have zero capitalism, zero competition - it would just be one giant company.": "Serj",
  "I think it's child abuse to have someone in the public eye too young. Society basically values wealth and fame and power at the cost of well-being. In the case of a child, it's at the cost of someone's natural development. It's already hard enough to develop.": "Alanis",
  "If you look at any Muslim society and you make a scale of how developed they are, and how successful the economy is, it's a straight line. It depends on how much they emancipate their women.": "Christopher",
  "People, for reasons of their own, often fail to do things that would be good for them or good for society.": "John",
  "We live in the kind of society where, in almost all cases, hard work is rewarded.": "Neil",

  "Affirmative action is an effort to include every aspect of society in the decision making.": "Andrew",
  "The more democratic and open a society is, the more it's exposed to terrorism. The more a country is free, not governed by a police regime, the more it risks hijackings or massacres like the ones that took place for many years in Italy and Germany and other parts of Europe.": "Oriana",
  "You can't gaze in the crystal ball and see the future. What the Internet is going to be in the future is what society makes it.": "Bob",
  "Don't accumulate if you do not need. The excess of wealth in your hands is for the society, and you are the trustee for the same.": "Mahavira",
  "The power of protest depends not only on how many turn out, but also on what legislative, judicial, and civil society institutions exist to enact the will of those marching in the streets.": "Cynthia",
  "A society that has more justice is a society that needs less charity.": "Ralph",
  "Economic progress, in capitalist society, means turmoil.": "Joseph",
  "I claim that human mind or human society is not divided into watertight compartments called social, political and religious. All act and react upon one another.": "Mahatma",
  "At the heart of these challenges lies the question of how the institutions of the European Union make laws, the types of laws they pass and the effectiveness with which those laws are implemented on civil society and the economy.": "John",

  "The winner of the hoop race will be the first to realize her dream, not society's dream, her own personal dream.": "Barbara",
  "The endurance of the inequalities of life by the poor is the marvel of human society.": "James",
  "Justice must always question itself, just as society can exist only by means of the work it does on itself and on its institutions.": "Michel",
  "So is civil society prepared for the future? Probably not. Most organisations have to live hand to mouth, juggling short-term funding and perpetual minor crises. Even the bigger ones rarely get much time to stand back and look at the bigger picture. Many are on a treadmill chasing after contracts and new funding.": "Geoff",
  "It is our responsibility to explain to the public how an often unpredictable system of justice is one that serves a productive, civilized, but always evolving, society.": "Sonia",

  "Solitude shows us what should be society shows us what we are. ": "Robert",
  "We need society, and we need solitude also, as we need summer and winter, day and night, exercise and rest.": "Philip",

  "Television and radio do a wonderful job in focusing attention on the problems of our society.": "Richard",
  "The core political values of our free society are so deeply embedded in our collective consciousness that only a few malcontents, lunatics generally, ever dare to threaten them.": "John",
  "We need a new Latin American policy that is bold - different. We need to focus on building civil society, focus on the lack of infrastructure. We need look at ways to foster economic opportunity. There needs to be a more comprehensive economic vision in the region.": "Mel",
  "The extent to which all people in our society are made to count, and believe that they count, is not just a measure of decency; it makes sound economic sense.": "Mary",
  "Our civic society is really all we have by way of nationhood.": "Cokie",
  "It is rather a problem of how to secure the best use of resources known to any of the members of society, for ends whose relative importance only those individuals know.": "Friedrich",
  "There's a whole set of values, spawned by the vocal and highly visible Republicans, that appeal to the worst in people. Our society is moving in that direction.": "Major",
  "Society mends its wounds. And that's invariably true in all the tragedies, in the comedies as well. And certainly in the histories.": "Charlton",
  "Persecution is the first law of society because it is always easier to suppress criticism than to meet it.": "Howard",
  "The emphasis on the birth of Christ tends to polarize our pluralistic society and create legal and ethnic belligerence.": "John",
  "Each individual member of a co-operative society works with that interest which is inseparable from the new position he enjoys. Each has an interest in the other.": "Leland",
  "We live in a democracy. We have this extraordinary opportunity to use our mind and say what we think, speak as we think. Sometimes what we say is objectionable to other people. But that is part of a free society.": "Hal",
  "I argued that the Bush administration, and the Coalition officials more recently, didn't understand Iraqi society. They thought it was a blank slate, that they could use Iraqis as guinea pigs.": "Juan",
  "Before a group can enter the open society, it must first close ranks.": "Stokely",
  "Simply that we are mirroring the trends in society, at any given time smuggling was an issue in the seventies, corruption is an issue today, and we faithfully reflect those issues.": "Ajay",
  "Our essential differences from the norm are both huge and deeply offensive to those among us who wish to be quietly integrated into society without particular reference to our nature.": "Malcolm",
  "I defend both the freedom of expression and society's right to counter it. I must pay the price for differing. It is the natural way of things.": "Naguib",
  "We must not inflict life on children who will be resented we must not inflict unwanted children on society. ": "Anne",
  "Writers, you know, are the beggars of Western society.": "Octavio",
  "There is no nonsense so gross that society will not, at some time, make a doctrine of it and defend it with every weapon of communal stupidity.": "Robertson",
  "There's a reason why every human society has fiction. It teaches us how to be 'good', to behave in a way that is for the benefit of the whole community.": "Orson",
  "There is one, and only one, thing in modern society more hideous than crime namely, repressive justice.": "Simone",
  "The progress of society is mainly the improvement in the condition of the workingmen of the world.": "Rutherford",
  "Our society finds truth too strong a medicine to digest undiluted. In its purest form, truth is not a polite tap on the shoulder. It is a howling reproach.": "Ted",
  "That sort of half sigh, which, accompanied by two or three slight nods of the head, is pity's small change in general society.": "Charles",
  "If you say, I'm for equal pay, that's a reform. But if you say. I'm a feminist, that's a transformation of society.": "Gloria",
  "We believe in personal choice, rather than society dictating how we must live our lives.": "Mike",
  "I'm kind of ashamed to be a celebrity. I don't understand wanting to read about other people's dirty laundry. I think celebrity is the biggest red herring society has ever pulled on itself.": "Jude",
  "Reconciliation is what takes place, of course, at higher levels. President Karzai has been very clear about the red lines for reconciliation, accept the constitution, lay down their weapons, cut their ties with al Qaeda and essentially become productive or at least participating members of society in that regard.": "David",
  "What is missing from today's dialogue is the effect autism is having on families, our society and what the unknown factors are. The 300lb. gorilla in the room is that our children with autism today will soon become adults with autism.": "Jenny",
  "I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of a opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises.": "Mitt",
  "Never categorize yourself, society does that to you, don't do it to yourself.": "Jason",
  "As a creative person, you just put something out into the consciousness of the society you live in.": "Annie",
  "I am certain no one sets out to be cruel, but our treatment of the elderly ill seems to have no philosophy to it. As a society, we should establish whether we have a policy of life at any cost.": "Terry",
  "I don't believe society understands what happens when everything is available, knowable and recorded by everyone all the time.": "Eric",
  "I don't think my principles change. I think the way in which you apply those principles to modern society changes.": "William",
  "One thing that makes France different from other countries is the tradition of social solidarity. People from all backgrounds and political positions are willing to contribute for services and protection of society as a whole - but on the condition that money is being spent effectively and that everyone is paying their part.": "Francois",
  "The sharecropper may lower his eyes, but not because he's less of a man. That's just a condition of society that such things exist.": "Ernest",
  "In the past, human society provided encouragement and opportunity for people to extend support to each other, especially in highly stressful situations.": "Daisaku",
  "Integrating in the society is a fundamental scriptural Christian trait. This integration is a must - moderate constructive integration. All of us, as Egyptians, have to participate.": "Pope",
  "The truth is, I think we are a self-less society, not a selfish society. Because we're so busy now.": "Phil",
  "You don't realize how much you use your credit card not even to buy things. It's a card you get so you can navigate society.": "Adam",
  "If anything needs to get fixed in society, it's people's consumption of other people's problems.": "Corey",
  "I think for the most part people are proud of the bicultural foundation New Zealand is built on and the fact that we are a multicultural society.": "John",
  "The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by a process of rational deduction.": "Paul",
  "In an oppressive society the truth-telling nature of literature is of a different order, and sometimes valued more highly than other elements in a work of art.": "Julian",
  "As intelligent and responsible filmmakers, working in a free society, we have a duty to ensure that our chosen medium is a force for good. Especially in this ever-more complex and difficult world.": "David",
  "The sign of a good society is where talent is respected.": "Irrfan",
  "We have a real role in how our own collective lives, our nation, and our world and society turn out. Seizing those opportunities is important, and disasters are sometimes one of those opportunities.": "Rebecca",
  "By liberating women from household work and helping to abolish professions such as domestic service, the washing machine and other household goods completely revolutionised the structure of society.": "Ha-Joon",
  "Those who are devoted to amusements; who love the society of those who love pleasure, have an aversion to religious exercises.": "Ellen",
  "Even though Chinese society was really closed, there were two windows for me to explore the world. One was from my mother and grandmother, the unseen and invisible world. Another window was brought from my father's side, those classic and Western books.": "Cai",
  "I went to Iraq because I wanted to see what one year of occupation had done to Iraqi society, and I went to the West Bank and Gaza Strip because I wanted to see what three generations of occupation had done to Palestinian society. I found a lot more hopelessness and despair in Palestine.": "Michael",
  "It's society that disables an individual by not investing in enough creativity to allow for someone to show us the quality that makes them rare and valuable and capable.": "Aimee",
  "It's almost a blessing when we meet people who naturally want to do the sort of things that are in high demand in society. What a gift to do that, as opposed to other people who would say, 'I want to be a novelist but actually I have to be an accountant.'": "Alain",
  "It is hard to read a newspaper or watch a television newscast without encountering someone who has come up with a new 'solution' to society's 'problems.'": "Thomas",
  "Britain is rich in radicalism, and anyone who says that our society has drifted into fatalism and apathy should get out more.": "Geoff",
  "Yes, the upper reaches of society are still dominated by men.": "Hanna",
  "A society that respects women needs to elect leaders who care more about women's lives than they do about their or their company's bottom line.": "Jackson",
  "If I wanted to develop a scenario to destroy America, I would do what the Republicans are doing. Take the brightest and best young black men off the streets, put them in jail, make them meaner than hell for 8 or 10 years and then turn them lose in a society where there are plenty of guns for them to play with.": "Andrew",
  "In a sane, civil, intelligent and moral society, you don't blame poor people for being poor.": "Andrew",
  "I like the struggles that people have, people who are feeling like they don't fit into society, because I still sort of feel that way.": "Steve",
  "Each of my books is different. Deliberately... I wanted to create my society, my people, in their fullness.": "Chinua",
  "In any society that is governed by the rule of law, some form of morality is always imposed. It's inescapable.": "Kirk",

  "I'm an Afro-realist. I take what comes, and I do my best to affect what is unacceptable in society.": "Wole",
  "Inspiration, in its rich variety, must be present in any discussion about Africa. We need role models - they are essential to the advancement of our society.": "Richard",
  "Our biggest struggle as human beings is to project ourselves as something that society has deemed admirable or likable instead of being honest.": "Matthew",
  "The Army confronted racial integration when it was still unpopular in society. It has been struggling to more fully integrate women. Its troops, after all, reflect society.": "Dana",
  "You will notice that the Occupy Wall Street crowds - and the progressives who support them - focus on bringing the wealthy down to earth rather than lifting the 99 percent. They have a nearly religious belief that too much wealth is fundamentally immoral and unhealthy for society.": "David",
  "Regardless of what society says, we can't go on much longer in the sea of immorality without judgment coming.": "Billy",
  "Certainly there is such a thing as chemical depression, and for that, obviously, there are issues that psychotherapists are much more expert at speaking to, but I think there is a low-grade depression that actually prevails in our society. And most of us feel it.": "Marianne",
  "When the Soviet Union fell, optimistic scholars believed the world had shifted inexorably in the direction of free markets and liberal democracy. Instead, the West gradually embraced bigger government and weaker social bonds, creating a fragmented society in which the only thing we all belong to, as President Barack Obama puts it, is the state.": "Ben",
  "I think rap music is brought up, gangster rap in particular, as well as video games, every other thing they try to hang the ills of society on as a scapegoat.": "Ice",
  "In 1952, I had gone to England on a literary pilgrimage, but what I also saw, even at that distance from the blitz, were bombed-out ruins and an enervated society, while the continent was still, psychologically, in the grip of its recent atrocities.": "Cynthia",
  "Even in democratic society, we don't have good answers how to balance the need for security on one hand and the protection of free speech on the other in our digital networks.": "Rebecca",
  "If one could only teach the English how to talk, and the Irish how to listen, society here would be quite civilized.": "Oscar",
  "Britain kept its position as the dominant world power well into the 20th century despite steady decline. By the end of World War II, dominance had shifted decisively into the hands of the upstart across the sea, the United States, by far the most powerful and wealthy society in world history.": "Noam",
  "Freedom without virtue isn't freedom - it will eventually destroy a society.": "Rush",
  "What is the society we wish to protect? Is it the society of complete surveillance for the commonwealth? Is this the wealth we seek to have in common - optimal security at the cost of maximal surveillance?": "Tom",
  "That I have the right to express myself freely at all times in all circumstances entails the idea that free speech is a 'basic human right' possessed by each individual, and, as such, trumps the interests of the society or group, including my neighbour.": "Tom",
  "One can be instructed in society, one is inspired only in solitude.": "Johann",
  "Life cannot subsist in society but by reciprocal concessions.": "Samuel",
  "Crimes against children are the most heinous crime. That, for me, would be a reason for capital punishment because children are innocent and need the guidance of an adult society.": "Clint",
  "I'm trying to make God more relevant in our society.": "Joel",
  "The gift of loneliness is sometimes a radical vision of society or one's people that has not previously been taken into account.": "Alice",
  "There's many women now who think, 'Surely we don't need feminism anymore, we're all liberated and society's accepting us as we are'. Which is just hogwash. It's not true at all.": "Yoko",
  "Your conscious brain cannot multitask. If I'm speaking to you and checking my I-Phone at the same time, I'm doing neither. This is why our society is frazzled; this misconception that we can consciously do more than one thing at a time effectively.": "Deepak",
  "It's a repressive society where you can't be horrible, I'm not horrible, they made me horrible, I'm just honest.": "John",
  "You can't have a United States if you are telling some folks that they can't get on the train. There is a cracking point where a society collapses.": "Bruce",
  "The Y2K bug is a genuine technical concern, consuming the energies of many specialists. But the prophecies of doom represent a broader worldview using the bug as a news hook. In this vision, the good society is a stable society, undisrupted by innovation, ambition or outside influences.": "Virginia",
  "If capitalism is to remain a healthy, vibrant economic system, corporations must participate in taking care of the society and the environment in which they live.": "Simon",
  "There's an unconscious bias in our society: girls are wonderful; boys are terrible. And to be a boy, or young man, growing up, having to listen to all this, it must be painful.": "Doris",
  "We can't blame children for occupying themselves with Facebook rather than playing in the mud. Our society doesn't put a priority on connecting with nature. In fact, too often we tell them it's dirty and dangerous.": "David",
  "I, for one, would think both about how far we have come as a country and how much further we need to go to erase racism and discrimination from our society.": "Charles",
  "I'm under the impression that this notion of decency is disappearing from our society where conflicts are made worse on cinema and on television, where people are nasty and cruel on the Internet and where, in general, everybody seems to be very angry.": "Helen",
  "This society cannot go forward, the way we have been going forward, where the gap between the rich and the poor keeps growing. It's not politically viable; it's not morally right; it's just not going to happen.": "Michael",
  "What you're seeing with Occupy Wall Street and the others are people who are unhappy and they're directing their unhappiness now toward Wall Street and toward those they think are doing too well in our society.": "Colin",
  "All the United States, it is a society that is split like to the bottom, that had very poor people in the country that is one of the wealthiest countries.": "Desmond",
  "I feel like sometimes that I was not meant for this society.": "Mike",
  "In virtually every Western society in the 1960s there was a moral revolution, an abandonment of its entire traditional ethic of self-restraint.": "Jonathan",
  "If you want a free society, teach your children what oppression tastes like. Tell them how many miracles it takes to get from here to there. Above all, encourage them to ask questions. Teach them to think for themselves.": "Jonathan",
  "Stabilizing the euro is one thing, healing the culture that surrounds it is another. A world in which material values are everything and spiritual values nothing is neither a stable state nor a good society. The time has come for us to recover the Judeo-Christian ethic of human dignity in the image of God.": "Jonathan",
  "Issues such as transparency often boil down to which side of - pick a number - 40 you're on. Under 40, and transparency is generally considered a good thing for society. Over 40, and one generally chooses privacy over transparency. On every side of this issue, hypocrisy abounds.": "Graydon",
  "We should ban banks from risk-taking because society is going to pay the price.": "Nassim",
  "One thing you have got to do politically is to identify the ties that bind society together and try to strengthen them.": "Boris",
  "To fulfill the promise of economic opportunity, we must remain true to the principle that collective bargaining is a cornerstone of a free society and indispensable to a strong middle class.": "Thomas",
  "Remove advertising, disable a person or firm from proclaiming its wares and their merits, and the whole of society and of the economy is transformed. The enemies of advertising are the enemies of freedom.": "David",

  "A system that was originally designed to support the poorest in society is now trapping them in the very condition it was supposed to alleviate.": "Iain",
  "If you look at the footballers, you look at our celebrity culture, we seem to be saying, 'This is the way you want to be'. We seem to be a society that celebrates all the wrong people.": "Iain",
  "We have to challenge the whole idea that it's acceptable for a society like Britain to have such a significant number of people who do not work one day of the week and don't have any possibility of improving the quality of their lives.": "Iain",
  "Awareness in our society has flipped all types of injustice on its head.": "Serj",
  "I think every artist should follow their vision, their hearts is what they need to reveal, not something that society is looking out for.": "Serj",
  "History shows, in my opinion, that no nation can survive the tension, conflict and antagonism of two competing languages and cultures. It is a blessing for an individual to be bilingual; it is a curse for a society to be bilingual.": "Richard",
  "Terror will crash down on us if we fail to understand that a pluralistic society requires the personal and daily commitment of every citizen.": "Tariq",
  "The very moment you understand that being a Muslim and being American or European are not mutually exclusive, you enrich your society. Promote the universal principles of justice and freedom, and leave the societies elsewhere to find their model of democracy based on their collective psychology and cultural heritage.": "Tariq",
  "Divorced from the cosmos, from nature, from society and from each other, we have become fractured and fragmented.": "Daisaku",
  "Dementia is often regarded as an embarrassing condition that should be hushed up and not spoken about. But I feel passionately that more needs to be done to raise awareness, which is why I became an ambassador for the Alzheimer's Society.": "Kevin",
  "Usually my ideas for work have revolved around my interest in people, especially people that live on the edges of society.": "Mary",
  "The British are supposed to be particularly averse to intellectuals, a prejudice closely bound up with their dislike of foreigners. Indeed, one important source of this Anglo-Saxon distaste for highbrows and eggheads was the French revolution, which was seen as an attempt to reconstruct society on the basis of abstract rational principles.": "Terry",
  "Why is it that here in the United States we have such difficulty even imagining a different sort of society from the one whose dysfunctions and inequalities trouble us so?": "Tony",
  "Comedy is a reflection. We create nothing. We set no styles, no standards. We're reflections. It's a distorted mirror in the fun house. We watch society. As society behaves, then we have the ability to make fun of it.": "Alan",
  "Unfortunately, our affluent society has also been an effluent society.": "Hubert",
  "The idea that we are going to be able to take our entire society as it currently works and simply change the source of energy and make it sustainable is not actually congruent with reality.": "Alex",
  "When you look at where the real problems are among minorities in our society, particularly blacks, it's at the bottom. It's the people who are in school systems that don't educate, neighborhoods where there is a lot of crime, drugs, the whole bit.": "Clarence",
  "Bankers - pillars of society who are going to hell if there is a God and He has been accurately quoted.": "John",
  "The permissiveness of society must be balanced with authoritativeness.": "Ferdinand",
  "Marriage cannot be severed from its cultural, religious and natural roots without weakening the good influence of society.": "Jack",

  "The forces in a capitalist society, if left unchecked, tend to make the rich richer and the poor poorer.": "Jawaharlal",
  "Any society where it's a crime or a hassle to be different is a society based on psychological fascism.": "David",
  "In our society leaving baby with Daddy is just one step above leaving the kids to be raised by wolves or apes.": "Al",
  "Since my retirement, I've spent a lot of time trying to help the School of Social Work at the University of North Carolina. A society like this just can't afford an uneducated underclass of citizens.": "Charles",
  "In a free society the state does not administer the affairs of men. It administers justice among men who conduct their own affairs.": "Walter",

  "An open society is a society which allows its members the greatest possible degree of freedom in pursuing their interests compatible with the interests of others.": "George",
  "Human rights commissions, as they are evolving, are an attack on our fundamental freedoms and the basic existence of a democratic society... It is in fact totalitarianism. I find this is very scary stuff.": "Stephen",
  "I think that, too many times, business has been seen as acting in its narrow self-interest rather than, essentially, contributing more broadly to society. I think a lot of that is unintentional; I don't think that many managers are deliberately trying to be unethical or are not trying to be sensitive to social needs.": "Michael",
  "Millennials are more aware of society's many challenges than previous generations and less willing to accept maximizing shareholder value as a sufficient goal for their work. They are looking for a broader social purpose and want to work somewhere that has such a purpose.": "Michael",
  "You shouldn't get to live in society and give nothing back. People complain about their taxes, yet they do nothing for the community. That makes me furious.": "Kathleen",
  "It does not seem that the contradiction which exists between the aristocratic function of art and the democratic structure of modern society can ever be resolved.": "Herbert",
  "Society is the union of men and not the men themselves.": "Charles",
  "A brain is a society of very small, simple modules that cannot be said to be thinking, that are not smart in themselves. But when you have a network of them together, out of that arises a kind of smartness.": "Kevin",
  "Even the most wretched individual of our present society could not exist and develop without the cumulative social efforts of countless generations.": "Mikhail",

  "Some people strengthen the society just by being the kind of people they are.": "John",
  "In many cases, jobs that used to be done by people are going to be able to be done through automation. I don't have an answer to that. That's one of the more perplexing problems of society.": "John",
  "Humans have always used animals to depict ideas about themselves: ideas about their status, about their position in life and society and the world.": "Alison",
  "I have also seen it stated that Capital punishment is murder in its worst form. I should like to know upon what principle of human society these assertions are based and justified.": "Benjamin",
  "For many centuries, suicides were treated like criminals by the society. That is part of the terrible legacy that has come down into society's method of handling suicide recovery. Now we have to fight off the demons that have been hanging around suicide for centuries.": "Judy",
  "The guard rails on a highway may restrict some folks from driving the way they want, but those rules mostly end up saving the lives of those other drivers who understand that living in a society means behaving in a commonly beneficial way.": "Steven",
  "I did it to myself. It wasn't society... it wasn't a pusher, it wasn't being blind or being black or being poor. It was all my doing.": "Ray",
  "Getting rid of the dictator is only a first step in establishing a free society. The dictatorship must also be disassembled.": "George",
  "A society that does not correctly interpret and appreciate its past cannot understand its present fortunes and adversities and can be caught unawares in a fast changing world.": "Ibrahim",
  "I'm sure mothers are important across every culture, but particularly in Korean society, the role of the mother is of great importance.": "Bong",
  "Much of the misgiving that Muslims feel for the West stems from our strong emphasis on freedom, always a risky enterprise. I've heard some say they would rather rear their children in a closely guarded Islamic society than in the United States, where freedom so often leads to decadence.": "Philip",
  "People are going to behave however the social norms permit, and beyond that.": "Max",
  "Russians clearly perceive America's global influence as being in irreversible decline and American society shattered by major political, economic and ideological crises.": "Ivan",

  "I have been a scientist for more than 40 years, having studied at Cambridge and Harvard. I researched and taught at Cambridge University, was a research fellow of the Royal Society, and have more than 80 publications in peer-reviewed journals. I am strongly pro-science.": "Rupert",
  "There are many who lust for the simple answers of doctrine or decree. They are on the left and right. They are not confined to a single part of the society. They are terrorists of the mind.": "A.",
  "Man is the animal that intends to shoot himself out into interplanetary space, after having given up on the problem of an efficient way to get himself five miles to work and back each day.": "Bill",
  "Periodically, the workers do revolt against bourgeois society, not by a hundred, five hundred, or a thousand, but by the millions.": "Ernest",
  "Our kids are actually doing what we told them to do when they sit in front of that TV all day or in front of that computer game all day. The society is telling kids unconsciously that nature's in the past. It really doesn't count anymore, that the future is in electronics, and besides, the bogeyman is in the woods.": "Richard",
  "Growth is a panacea for many ills in society; not entirely, but many.": "P.",
  "If you're a kid who is always on the outside hoping to be on the inside, you're watching a lot. You're trying to figure out how to become a normal person in a society that considers you weird.": "Katherine",
  "We live in a multi-cultural society far more open to international ideas. If you'd told me 20 years ago I'd drive through Bury and see someone sitting outside a cafe drinking a latte, I'd have laughed. In fact, I wouldn't have even known what a latte was.": "Gary",
  "We are shifting from a managerial society to an entrepreneurial society.": "John",

  "I like to describe myself as a proudly visible member of the most invisible segments of our society - older women.": "Cindy",
  "At a time when India is going through great changes and, with China, is likely to inherit the world from the West, it is important that writers like me try to highlight the brutal injustices of society.": "Aravind",
  "If we were in India now, there would be servants standing in the corners of this room and I wouldn't notice them. That is what my society is like, that is what the divide is like.": "Aravind",

  "I want to be fighting for a society accountable towards its citizens.": "Binyavanga",
  "A theme in a lot of my books - and in my own life - is making choices that you feel you should make, or what society wants you to make, as opposed to what is truly right for you.": "Emily",

  "The chief product of an automated society is a widespread and deepening sense of boredom.": "C.",
  "However, please allow me to say that the fundamental style of my writing has been to start from my personal matters and then to link it up with society, the state and the world.": "Kenzaburo",
  "In practice, socialism didn't work. But socialism could never have worked because it is based on false premises about human psychology and society, and gross ignorance of human economy.": "David",
  "The judge said I was a menace to society because I had put crime on a scientific basis.": "Gregory",

  "Do not ghettoize society by putting people into legal categories of gender, race, ethnicity, language, or other such characteristics.": "Preston",
  "The question I asked Georges has now become a general one - You, who thought you were superfluous, who thought there was no place for you in society, not only are you not superfluous, you are needed and so those who were beggars become givers.": "Abbe",

  "Interethnic and spiritual accord is our strategic resource, the basis for progress of our society and state.": "Nursultan",
  "I feel that I'll be buried in Ireland and don't think I'll ever live in the U.S. I'm not comfortable with many aspects of U.S. society - especially the justice system.": "John",
  "The remedy for speech that is false is speech that is true. This is the ordinary course in a free society. The response to the unreasoned is the rational; to the uninformed, the enlightened; to the straight-out lie, the simple truth.": "Anthony",

  "It is good for society to have this introspection.": "Jacques",
  "Profit is the sole criterion used by the establishment to evaluate economic activity. From the rat race to lame ducks. The vocabulary in vogue is a give-away. It's more reminiscent of a human menagerie than human society.": "Jimmy",
  "Our laws are a reflection of our culture. Our culture does not condone the torture of innocent and defenseless creatures. And we as a society believe all God's creatures should be treated humanely.": "Joe",
  "In the end, does it really matter if newspapers physically disappear? Probably not: the world is always changing. But does it matter if organisations independent enough and rich enough to employ journalists to do their job disappear? Yes, that matters hugely; it affects the whole of life and society.": "Andrew",

  "Each country thinks its school is in a specific crisis, without ever linking the school's crisis to that of the society around it.": "Daniel",

  "Never forget that everything Hitler did in Germany was legal.": "Martin",
  "If taxes are laid upon us in any shape without our having a legal representation where they are laid, are we not reduced from the character of free subjects to the miserable state of tributary slaves? We claim British rights not by charter only! We are born to them.": "Samuel",
  "We need to remain a nation that doesn't just welcome but that celebrates legal immigrants who come here seeking to pursue the American Dream.": "Ted",
  "Gambling is legal and betting is legal, for what I bet.": "Michael",
  "Justice delayed is justice denied.": "William",
  "Well, when I think of steroids I think of an image. You have the advantage over someone, which is a form of cheating. I guess it wouldn't be right unless it was legal for everybody. Reason it's not legal for everybody is because it can hurt people seriously.": "Evander",
  "I busted a mirror and got seven years bad luck, but my lawyer thinks he can get me five.": "Steven",
  "Laws made by common consent must not be trampled on by individuals.": "George",

  "As Congress continues to debate ways to address illegal immigration, we must remember the many hard-working legal immigrants that contribute so much to our nation's economy and culture.": "Bob",
  "There should not be a question of legal or illegal immigration. People came and immigrated to this country from the time of the Indians. No one's illegal. They should just be able to come.": "Linda",
  "Obedience to lawful authority is the foundation of manly character.": "Robert",

  "Laws are like sausages, it is better not to see them being made.": "Otto",
  "If you take guns away from legal gun owners, then the only people who would have guns would be the bad guys. Even a pacifist would get violent if someone were trying to kill him or her. You would fight for your life, whatever your beliefs.": "Bruce",

  "People do not win people fights. Lawyers do.": "Norman",
  "I think the key to getting rid of illegal immigration, no matter where its coming from, is that you need to have a good legal apparatus for immigration.": "Rand",
  "Socialism, reduced to its simplest legal and practical expression, means the complete discarding of the institution of private property by transforming it into public property, and the division of the resultant public income equally and indiscriminately among the entire population.": "George",
  "Common sense often makes good law.": "William",
  "Let me remind you that nuclear disarmament is not just an ardent desire of the people, as expressed in many resolutions of the United Nations. It is a legal commitment by the five official nuclear states, entered into when they signed the Non-Proliferation Treaty.": "Joseph",
  "No one can doubt that the sufferings of the sober, virtuous woman, in legal subjection to the mastership of a drunken, immoral husband and father over herself and children, not only from physical abuse, but from spiritual shame and humiliation, must be such as the man himself can not possibly comprehend.": "Susan",
  "I think the most important idea is to remember that there have been times throughout American history where what is right is not the same as what is legal.": "Edward",
  "I'm trusting in the Lord and a good lawyer.": "Oliver",
  "That which is not just is not law.": "William",
  "We have a legal and moral obligation to rid our world of nuclear tests and nuclear weapons. When we put an end to nuclear tests, we get closer to eliminating all nuclear weapons. A world free of nuclear weapons will be safer and more prosperous.": "Ban",

  "The legal battle against segregation is won, but the community battle goes on.": "Dorothy",
  "Legal discrimination between the sexes is, in almost every instance, founded on outmoded views of society and the pre-scientific beliefs about psychology and physiology. It is time to sweep away these relics of the past and set further generations free of them.": "Shirley",
  "Collecting more taxes than is absolutely necessary is legalized robbery.": "Calvin",
  "It is right to give every man his due.": "Plato",
  "There comes a time when a human being has to either face evil or admit to allowing it. Abortion is legal in the United States, but it should not be celebrated or used as a political tool. Viable babies are human beings.": "Bill",
  "The events of the day inspired me to become a lawyer.": "Christopher",
  "The keystone to justice is the belief that the legal system treats all fairly.": "Janet",
  "The history of American democracy, to say the least, has been checkered. Our nation was founded at a time when people of African descent were held in bondage. After slavery was abolished, they were forced to endure legal discrimination for another 100 years.": "Bernie",
  "I did a little bit of acting - some guest spots here and there. I got a job working as a therapist doing individual and group crisis intervention and family therapy. I did that for two years. I left to do 'Boston Legal.' So my psychology career has been interwoven into my acting career, and it's my safety net and fallback.": "Meredith",
  "Rule-following, legal precedence, and political consistency are not more important than right, justice and plain common-sense.": "W.",
  "It costs a lot to sue a magazine, and it's too bad that we don't have a system where the losing team has to pay the winning team's lawyers.": "Carol",

  "We not only have a legal obligation to honor our commitments, we have a moral obligation to provide the coverage we promised to provide to these people.": "Bob",
  "Who most benefits from keeping marijuana illegal? The greatest beneficiaries are the major criminal organizations in Mexico and elsewhere that earn billions of dollars annually from this illicit trade - and who would rapidly lose their competitive advantage if marijuana were a legal commodity.": "George",
  "Being a justice. If you love law the way I do... you're given the job of a lifetime... you're permitted to address the most important legal questions of the country, and sometimes the world. And in doing so, you make a difference in people's lives.": "Sonia",
  "There will be gay couples; it will exist. It is not very nice that people who are married - who divorce in three seconds - don't want protection for the others. The legal system should protect everyone, not just the few people who think they are above everybody else because they are married.": "Karl",
  "You cannot grant amnesty. If the American people see us granting amnesty they will never again believe in legal immigration. They will never again support it, and that's wrong for our country, bad for our future.": "Marco",
  "We will have to accept a certain degree of legal immigration; that's globalisation... In the era of the smartphone, we cannot shut ourselves away... people know full well how we live in Europe.": "Angela",
  "It would be a sign of society changing if we did finally legalize prostitution. Once it's legal, it doesn't mean your daughter's going to run out and be a ho. The more we sort of bring these things into the light, you bring these hidden vices into the light, the less power they have over our society. You make it legal, it tends to go away.": "Thomas",
  "No country could claim to be civilized if its legal system weren't available to everyone in it.": "Sydney",
  "Are hackers a threat? The degree of threat presented by any conduct, whether legal or illegal, depends on the actions and intent of the individual and the harm they cause.": "Kevin",
  "However, there is no legal and legitimate state called Israel.": "Hassan",
  "There are half a billion people that listen to music online and the vast majority are doing so illegally. But if we bring those people over to the legal side and Spotify, what is going to happen is we are going to double the music industry and that will lead to more artists creating great new music.": "Daniel",
  "The legal right of the Southern people to reclaim their fugitives I have constantly admitted. The legal right of Congress to interfere with their institution in the states, I have constantly denied.": "Abraham",
  "Public confidence in, and support for, the euro - and, indeed, the European Union - will ultimately be determined by how well we deliver on growth and jobs rather than on institutional wrangling and complex legal or technical negotiations.": "Enda",
  "Legal and bureaucratic impediments to surveillance should be removed.": "Mike",
  "Any new legal measures, or cooperative arrangements between government and companies meant to keep people from organizing violence or criminal actions, must not be carried out in ways that erode due process, rule of law and the protection of innocent citizens' political and civil rights.": "Rebecca",
  "Reading a script is usually as exciting as reading a boilerplate legal document, so when you read one that makes you feel as if you're seeing the movie, you know it's something different.": "Tom",
  "In countries with a properly functioning legal system, the mob continues to exist, but it is rarely called upon to mete out capital punishment. The right to take human life belongs to the state. Not so in societies where weak courts and poor law enforcement are combined with intractable structural injustices.": "Teju",
  "Of all the creative work produced by humans anywhere, a tiny fraction has continuing commercial value. For that tiny fraction, the copyright is a crucially important legal device.": "Lawrence",
  "Every one with this writ may be a tyrant; if this commission be legal, a tyrant in a legal manner, also, may control, imprison, or murder any one within the realm.": "James",
  "There are millions of people who consume music illegally every month. Just getting them into a legal service will make the music industry way bigger than it's ever been before.": "Daniel",
  "I've led a school whose faculty and students examine and discuss and debate every aspect of our law and legal system. And what I've learned most is that no one has a monopoly on truth or wisdom. I've learned that we make progress by listening to each other, across every apparent political or ideological divide.": "Elena",
  "Outside of the Constitution we have no legal authority more than private citizens, and within it we have only so much as that instrument gives us. This broad principle limits all our functions and applies to all subjects.": "Andrew",
  "Unlike national legal systems, there are precious few avenues to address judicial activism at the WTO. You pretty much have to gain consensus to change the agreements, or simply withdraw from the system. The first is nearly impossible, and the second would be - in the view of many - cataclysmic.": "Robert",
  "Death Row inmates are almost twice as expensive to house each year as other inmates. Death penalty trials are much costlier than trials where execution is not a potential punishment and consume more time from judges, public defenders, and other legal personnel.": "Reid",
  "One of the things I was taught in law school is that I'd never be able to think the same again - that being a lawyer is something that's part of who I am as an individual now.": "Anita",
  "Lawyers spend a great deal of their time shoveling smoke.": "Oliver",
  "Now a slave is not 'held' by any legal contract, obligation, duty, or authority, which the laws will enforce. He is 'held' only by brute force. One person beats another until the latter will obey him, work for him, if he require it, or do nothing if he require it.": "Lysander",
  "Yes, the state must intervene to prevent the exploitation of poor Indian women who are enticed or coerced into surrogacy, as well as to protect the rights of surrogate children. However, it should also be empathetic to individuals with alternative lifestyles who are well within their legal and human rights to demand access to surrogacy services.": "Kapil",
  "We have a legal immigration system that's outdated, it's primarily based on whether you have family members living here. In the 21st century, it has to be more of a merit-based system, and that is why our legal immigration system is in need of modernization.": "Marco",
  "I believe we can, and must, strike a balance between our shared American values of religious liberty and freedom from discrimination. My concerns lie with the possible consequences of politically-driven legislation which claims to promote religious liberty but instead rolls back the legal protections held by LGBT Americans.": "Gary",
  "The memory of the 146 people who lost their lives in the Triangle Shirtwaist fire stands as a reminder that legal protections and workplace safety standards were won through a long struggle for social justice and at great human cost.": "Eric",
  "Places where prostitution is legal, you find much better health care, fewer cases of disease and illegal abortions. There's really nothing to be gained by keeping prostitution illegal.": "Thomas",
  "I believe the attorney general or the deputy attorney general has an obligation to follow the law and the Constitution and to give their independent legal advice to the President.": "Sally",
  "I'm not a lawyer, and maybe I should have used more specific legal language.": "Sonny",
  "A lean compromise is better than a fat lawsuit.": "George",
  "Globalization is a great thing, but it needs a legal framework in which to blossom.": "Loretta",
  "Farming with live animals is a 7 day a week, legal form of slavery.": "George",
  "Recently a study proved that working from a larger, less cluttered computer screen increases concentration. I could have told them that. And yes, I write first drafts with a mechanical pencil and a yellow legal pad. There's good reason for this primitive behavior: I am a crackerjack typist. My hand moves far more quickly than my brain.": "Stacy",
  "Lawyers, I suppose, were children once.": "Charles",
  "I would say that IQ is the strongest predictor of which field you can get into and hold a job in, whether you can be an accountant, lawyer or nurse, for example.": "Daniel",
  "While the Census Bureau already has a legal obligation to keep people's information confidential, we all know that in an age of cyber attacks and computer hacking that ensuring people's privacy can be difficult.": "Jeff",
  "The legal system is often a mystery, and we, its priests, preside over rituals baffling to everyday citizens.": "Henry",
  "It is not unprofessional to give free legal advice, but advertising that the first visit will be free is a bit like a fox telling chickens he will not bite them until they cross the threshold of the hen house.": "Warren",
  "We owe the Aboriginal peoples a debt that is four centuries old. It is their turn to become full partners in developing an even greater Canada. And the reconciliation required may be less a matter of legal texts than of attitudes of the heart.": "Romeo",
  "Unless you have a perception of who you are as a lawyer, you will never be at ease in dealing with legal matters, clients, or courts. But if you know who you are and why you're there, all you need is the expertise and the information.": "Samuel",
  "So the Comic Book Legal Defense Fund is out there preserving and fighting for, and sometimes winning and sometimes losing, the fight for First Amendment rights in comics and, more generally, for freedom of speech.": "Neil",
  "I remember when I took Quentin Tarantino with me to a very private screening of the documentary 'Roman Polanski: Wanted and Desired,' which shows some of the legal irregularities of his case. I was involved by the film, and it was an amazing experience to see people weep at the end of it.": "Harvey",
  "A potlatch is similar to a court case in that both are prohibitively expensive; both involve lengthy speeches and the vigorous examination and debate of the actions, rights and legal responsibilities of the participants. One has food, singing and spiritual rites; the other, not so much.": "Eden",
  "Nothing is so unproductive as the law. It is expensive whether you win or lose.": "Gilbert",
  "I have been committed to carrying out my duties... in accordance with both the letter and spirit of all applicable rules of ethics and canons of conduct.": "Samuel",
  "Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11 has been carried out by an American citizen or a legal permanent resident, not by recent immigrants or by refugees. So tamping down immigration won't fix the real issue, which is 'homegrown' terrorism.": "Peter",
  "Those who challenge the law in one or another of its aspects weaken the whole legal structure of society. For one man to disobey a law he does not like is to invite others to disobey another law which he may regard as indispensable to his own livelihood - or life.": "Robert",
  "As legal residents, immigrants would contribute more in taxes, spend more at our businesses, start companies of their own and create more jobs. Immigration is not a problem for us to solve but an opportunity for America to seize.": "Jose",
  "We need to let the referee's sole thing be to protect the quarterback and get those late hits out of there. They even have a stat on television that says 'knockdowns.' Knockdowns means that you knock him down after he throws the ball. The assumption is, if it's legal, we'll make excuses for them.": "John",
  "Men's indignation, it seems, is more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks like being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a superior.": "Thucydides",
  "I have always been of opinion that all the political workers should be indifferent and should never bother about the legal fight in the law courts and should boldly bear the heaviest possible sentences inflicted upon them. They may defend themselves but always from purely political considerations and never from a personal point of view.": "Bhagat",
  "Lawsuit: A machine which you go into as a pig and come out of as a sausage.": "Ambrose",
