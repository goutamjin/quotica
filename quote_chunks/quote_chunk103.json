  "The thing I love about Rome is that is has so many layers. In it, you can follow anything that interests you: town planning, architecture, churches or culture. It's a city rich in antiquity and early Christian treasures, and just endlessly fascinating. There's nowhere else like it.": "Claire",
  "Liquid architecture. It's like jazz - you improvise, you work together, you play off each other, you make something, they make something. And I think it's a way of - for me, it's a way of trying to understand the city, and what might happen in the city.": "Frank",
  "The history of the Jews has been written overwhelmingly by scholars of texts - understandably given the formative nature of the Bible and the Talmud. Seeing Jewish history through artifacts, architecture and images is still a young but spectacularly flourishing discipline that's changing the whole story.": "Simon",
  "In art or architecture your project is only done when you say it's done. If you want to rip it apart at the eleventh hour and start all over again, you never finish. I was one of those crazy creatures.": "Maya",
  "Architecture is a negotiated art, and it's highly political, and if you want to make buildings, there is diplomacy required.": "Thom",
  "I'm not an interior decorator; I'm a designer, and that includes the architecture. The package must be strong and controlled, the rooms aligned, and the windows positioned to make sense with the furniture. Fluff it up, and you've got big trouble.": "Anouska",
  "In a society that celebrates the inessential, architecture can put up a resistance, counteract the waste of forms and meanings and speak its own language.": "Peter",
  "Architecture has curled up in a ball and it's about itself. It has found itself either as a freakshow, where you're not sure if it's good or bad but at least it's interesting, or at the behest of forces of commerce.": "David",
  "When you have rules to abide by, does that curtail you as a designer, or set you free? People think of classical architecture visually, but I think the brilliant part of it is actually spatial.": "Annabelle",
  "I wanted a real profession. And I'd always been interested in architecture and in design and in, really, what makes things work. And understanding what's kind of behind the walls and why things stand up and some things don't.": "S.",
  "I love a lot of things, and I'm pretty much obsessive about most things I do, whether it be gardening, or architecture, or music. I'd be an obsessive hairdresser.": "Gates",
  "Each new situation requires a new architecture.": "Jean",
  "We require from buildings two kinds of goodness: first, the doing their practical duty well: then that they be graceful and pleasing in doing it.": "John",
  "All the revision in the world will not save a bad first draft: for the architecture of the thing comes, or fails to come, in the first conception, and revision only affects the detail and ornament, alas!": "T.",
  "There is a lot of bad architecture. What we need more is to look at how our landscape should look in the next decades.": "Dieter",
  "To me, architecture is an art, naturally, and it isn't architecture unless it's alive. Alive is what art is. If it's not alive, it's dead, and it's not art.": "John",
  "Without this spirit, Modernist architecture cannot fully exist. Since there is often a mismatch between the logic and the spirit of Modernism, I use architecture to reconcile the two.": "Tadao",
  "A lasting architecture has to have roots.": "I.",
  "I've always thought that design can have equal importance to the idea of internal architecture. Professionally, things can be very dogmatic - you do the architecture, someone else does the interiors, someone else does the furniture, the fabric, etc. But I think design is all-encompassing.": "Zaha",
  "We have to base architecture on the environment.": "Toyo",
  "My house is my refuge, an emotional piece of architecture, not a cold piece of convenience.": "Luis",
  "Light, God's eldest daughter, is a principal beauty in a building.": "Thomas",
  "In architecture you should live for 150 years, because you have to learn in the first 75 years.": "Renzo",
  "The very essence of architecture consists of a variety and development reminiscent of natural organic life. This is the only true style in architecture.": "Alvar",
  "Good architecture should be a projection of life itself, and that implies an intimate knowledge of biological, social, technical, and artistic problems.": "Walter",
  "I think about architecture all the time. That's the problem. But I've always been like that. I dream it sometimes.": "Zaha",
  "I think the chance of finding beauty is higher if you don't work on it directly. Beauty in architecture is driven by practicality. This is what you learn from studying the old townscapes of the Swiss farmers.": "Peter",
  "I would say that to put architecture in the chain of history, to be able to interpret and understand why we are where we are, is quite crucial.": "Rafael",
  "In Los Angeles, by the time you're 35, you're older than most of the buildings.": "Delia",
  "An important work of architecture will create polemics.": "Richard",
  "My architecture is the architecture of survival.": "Frei",
  "Wherever technology reaches its real fulfillment, it transcends into architecture.": "Ludwig",
  "Does it follow that the house has nothing in common with art and is architecture not to be included in the arts? Only a very small part of architecture belongs to art: the tomb and the monument. Everything else that fulfils a function is to be excluded from the domain of art.": "Adolf",
  "Architecture has a strong link with the movies in terms of time progression, sequencing, framing, all of that.": "Christian",
  "Architecture is measured against the past; you build in the future, and you try to imagine the future.": "Richard",
  "To me... San Francisco is an ideal city, intellectually stimulating and naturally beautiful. The oceans and forests are close enough to refresh the spirit; the architecture is always exciting.": "Ruth",
  "Cities are the greatest creations of humanity.": "Daniel",
  "The organizational architecture is really that a centipede walks on hundred legs and one or two don't count. So if I lose one or two legs, the process will go on, the organization will go on, the growth will go on.": "Mukesh",
  "Nothing requires the architect's care more than the due proportions of buildings.": "Vitruvius",
  "Proportions are what makes the old Greek temples classic in their beauty. They are like huge blocks, from which the air has been literally hewn out between the columns.": "Arne",
  "I think architecture has to be a gift.": "Jean",
  "I would like to use architecture to create bonds between people who live in cities, and even use it to recover the communities that used to exist in every single city.": "Toyo",
  "I could have been an architect, but I don't think I'd have been very happy. Nearly all modern architecture is a silly game as far as I can see.": "Roger",
  "The rules of navigation never navigated a ship. The rules of architecture never built a house.": "Thomas",
  "I acquired an admiration for Japanese culture, art, and architecture, and learned of the existence of the game of GO, which I still play.": "Philip",
  "Nothing is as dangerous in architecture as dealing with separated problems. If we split life into separated problems we split the possibilities to make good building art.": "Alvar",
  "I like to play with architecture! It's my favorite game.": "Jean",
  "Architecture is not merely national but clearly has local ties in that it is rooted in the earth.": "Alvar",
  "If people want to see Beaux-Arts, it's fine with me. I'm interested in good architecture as anybody else.": "Louis",
  "I'd been to Stourhead and was inspired by the perfect parity between architecture and art; in fact, the architecture is the art. I wrote a piece called 'Not Sculpture Park,' because most of these things become car parks for bought-in sculpture. The artists should be working with the site, not just plonking pieces down.": "Charles",
  "I think New Orleans is such a beautiful city. It looks like a fairytale when you walk through the French Quarter or the Garden District. There is such a lush sense of color, style, architecture - and the people themselves.": "Anika",
  "In a way I spend my entire life stealing from everything - from the past, from cities I love, from where I grew up - grabbing things, taking not only from architecture but from Italy, art, writing, poetry, music.": "Renzo",
  "There is something about giving everything to your profession. In Italian, an obsession is not necessarily negative. It's the art of putting all your energy into one thing; it's the art of transforming even what you eat for lunch into architecture.": "Renzo",
  "I came to architecture from building. Because my father was a builder, everybody was - and is - a builder in my family.": "Renzo",
  "I have traveled a fair amount, and I have visited some great cities. I love architecture and museums and castles and ruins and central markets and even double-decker bus tours. But, I am a sucker for a tropical beach.": "Chelsea",
  "The artistic part of us all - I think that the easiest way to appreciate this - is through architecture. Architecture is very impressive; the beauty of buildings, temples.": "Carlos",
  "Any work of architecture that has with it some discussion, some polemic, I think is good. It shows that people are interested, people are involved.": "Richard",
  "I believe that artistic activities change people. You do effect change. I see architecture as a political, social and cultural act - that is its primary role.": "Thom",
  "A building has integrity just like a man. And just as seldom.": "Ayn",
  "Don't clap too hard - it's a very old building.": "John",
  "The ancient Romans built their greatest masterpieces of architecture, their amphitheaters, for wild beasts to fight in.": "Voltaire",
  "We build buildings which are terribly restless. And buildings don't go anywhere. They shouldn't be restless.": "Minoru",
  "Architecture can't fully represent the chaos and turmoil that are part of the human personality, but you need to put some of that turmoil into the architecture, or it isn't real.": "Frank",
  "Not many architects have the luxury to reject significant things.": "Rem",
  "Architects today tend to depreciate themselves, to regard themselves as no more than just ordinary citizens without the power to reform the future.": "Kenzo",
  "Every building is a prototype. No two are alike.": "Helmut",
  "The team architecture means setting up an organization that helps people produce that great work in teams.": "Jay",
  "We are stymied by regulations, limited choice and the threat of litigation. Neither consultants nor industry itself provide research which takes architecture forward.": "Arthur",
  "And when an architect has designed a house with large windows, which is a necessity today in order to pull the daylight into these very deep houses, then curtains come to play a big role in architecture.": "Arne",
  "I probably spent the first 20 years of my life wanting to be as American as possible. Through my 20s, and into my 30s, I began to become aware of how so much of my art and architecture has a decidedly Eastern character.": "Maya",
  "Japanese traditional architecture is created based on these conditions. This is the reason you have a very high degree of connection between the outside and inside in architecture.": "Tadao",
  "Architecture is involved with the world, but at the same time it has a certain autonomy. This autonomy cannot be explained in terms of traditional logic because the most interesting parts of the work are non-verbal. They operate within the terms of the work, like any art.": "Thom",
  "It seems a fantastic paradox, but it is nevertheless a most important truth, that no architecture can be truly noble which is not imperfect.": "John",
  "I'm drawn to furniture design as complete architecture on a minor scale.": "Brad",
  "I like things that are kind of eclectic, when one thing doesn't go with another. That's why I love Rome. The town itself is that way. It's where Fascist architecture meets classic Renaissance, where the ancient bangs up against the contemporary. It has a touch of everything. That's my style, and that's what my work is about.": "Giambattista",
  "It is not with architecture that one can disseminate any political ideology.": "Oscar",
  "My mother studied English and drama at the University of Pennsylvania, where my father studied architecture. She was a great influence in all sorts of ways, a wicked wit.": "Donald",
  "One my favorite things is to go to the provinces of Russia and see the 18th century wood churches with the onion dome architecture. These humble wonders of incredible imagination of architects that were obviously not living in places like Paris or London, but they've created these amazing churches.": "Andre",
  "Half of architecture students are women, and you see respected, established female architects all the time.": "Zaha",
  "Architecture is exposed to life. If its body is sensitive enough, it can assume a quality that bears witness to past life.": "Peter",
  "There is still a real need for good quality architecture, not paper architecture, but the real stuff.": "Peter",
  "The problem with digital architecture is that an algorithm can produce endless variations, so an architect has many choices.": "Peter",
  "Architecture is definitely a political act.": "Peter",
  "The World's Fair was the precursor to theme parks like Disneyworld, and the really sort of cheap, superficial promotional architecture that you see everywhere in the U.S. I think there's a danger when you start creating a civilisation that isn't meant to last.": "Sufjan",
  "Many of the received models of modern architecture and planning owe their ultimate origin to the building code and public health reform movements of the second half of the 19th century.": "Kenneth",
  "Architecture is not a profession for the faint-hearted, the weak-willed, or the short-lived.": "Martin",
  "Architecture is by definition a very collaborative process.": "Joshua",
  "The future of architecture is culture.": "Philip",
  "Once you learn to look at architecture not merely as an art more or less well or more or less badly done, but as a social manifestation, the critical eye becomes clairvoyant.": "Louis",
  "I'm not a religious person. But, when I look at a beautiful cathedral, what brings awe, what induces awe is the idea that architecture, you know, a beautiful cathedral, a beautiful building.": "Jason",
  "I have a preference for rough architecture, real, inexpensive, unfinished.": "Thom",
  "'Clothespin' was the first city monument on a large scale that could compete with the architecture around it.": "Claes",
  "The visual architecture of 'Biutiful' is the most sophisticated of all the films I have directed.": "Alejandro",
  "I initially thought I would be an architect, maybe. So I went to architecture camp and quickly learned that I did not want to be an architect. I was like, 'No. This is not for me.'": "Robin",
  "To me, form doesn't always follow function. Form has a life of its own, and at times, it may be the motivating force in design. When you're dealing with form as a sculptor, you feel that you are quite free in attempting to mould and shape things you want to do, but in architecture, it's much more difficult because it has to have a function.": "I.",
  "When people are deprived of a sense, their other senses get heightened. If you're culturally devoid of something - of weather, of artistry, of interesting architecture, all the way down the line to culture itself - you're either forced to give in and get that car dealership, or you manufacture those things for yourself.": "Tim",
  "To me it was fascinating, the idea of going to university and studying a subject - architecture - that I had already faced in building some small houses.": "Mario",
  "Great architecture of the past was always clear. SFMOMA is still a simple building to understand.": "Mario",
  "I search for surprise in my architecture. A work of art should cause the emotion of newness.": "Oscar",
  "Architecture struck me between the eye and the eyeball.": "Louis",
  "Frank Lloyd Wright made houses right up until the end. I think that's important because it gives you a direct connection to all the basic aspects of architecture - the spatial energy of the place, the construction, the materials, the site, the detail.": "Steven",
  "I think all good architecture should challenge you, make you start asking questions. You don't have to understand it. You may not like it. That's OK.": "Thom",
  "With vocal and choral music, first and foremost, it's the text. Not only do I need to serve the text, but the text - when I'm doing it right - acts as the perfect 'blueprint', and all the architecture is there. The poet has done the heavy lifting, so my job is to find the soul of the poem and then somehow translate that into music.": "Eric",
  "Gothic architecture requires individual craftsmanship. The wish to create an enclosed world for the congregation gives rise in Gothic architecture to the need to create something wherein the activity of the congregation plays a part.": "Rudolf",
  "On inspection, Gaudi's architecture isn't whimsical at all.": "P.",
  "Architecture has recorded the great ideas of the human race. Not only every religious symbol, but every human thought has its page in that vast book.": "Victor",
  "Splendid architecture, the love of your life, an old friend... they can all go drifting by unseen if you're not careful.": "Ian",
  "Clothing has been called intimate architecture. We want to go beyond that.": "Issey",
  "Of course I know very little about architecture, and the older I get the less I know.": "Richard",
  "One of the most persistent yet elusive dreams of the Modern Movement in architecture has been prefabrication: industrially made structures that can be assembled at a building site.": "Martin",
  "All architecture, classical or not, must have some sense of order, and order is much harder to achieve without the straight lines and right angles that have dominated the building art from time immemorial.": "Martin",
  "I don't know why I've always been so captivated by architecture.": "Tim",
  "Winning a competition in architecture is a ticket to oblivion. It's just an idea. Ninety-nine per cent never get built.": "Daniel",
  "I do believe architecture, and all art, should be content-driven. It should have something to say beyond the sensational.": "Charles",
  "Princeton University's campus environment presents unique challenges and opportunities for architecture to act as a social condenser.": "Steven",
  "I started off in journalism 16 years ago in Stockholm, and I wrote for a few different publications for many years. I've also worked in advertising as a copywriter and creative director, but I changed it for architecture at 25 years old.": "Magnus",
  "They can do without architecture who have no olives nor wines in the cellar.": "Henry",
  "The common thread for everything I do is this idea of a Web-services architecture. What does that mean? It means taking components of software and systems and having them be self-describing, so that you can aim them, ask them what their capabilities are, and communicate with them using a standard protocol.": "Bill",
  "Tel Aviv is new, built on the sand dunes north of Jaffa in the 1890s, about the same time Miami was founded. The cities bear a resemblance in size, site, climate, and architecture, which ranges from the bland to the fancifully bland.": "P.",
  "People wouldn't know this about me, but I adore ball gowns. I love their cut, their architecture and the thought of the hands of so many seamstresses working on them.": "Patti",
  "I see only one requirement you have to have to be a director or any kind of artist: rhythm. Rhythm, for me, is everything. Without rhythm, there's no music. Without rhythm, there's no cinema. Without rhythm, there's no architecture.": "Alejandro",
  "The substance of fictional architecture is not bricks and mortar but evanescent consciousness.": "John",
  "I was planning to go into architecture. But when I arrived, architecture was filled up. Acting was right next to it, so I signed up for acting instead.": "Gilbert",
  "If you're inclined to dismiss L.A. as a place of unrelenting vapidity and generic 1980s architecture, then you're doing yourself and L.A. a huge disservice, and you're just not looking hard enough.": "Moby",
  "I've gone to school for business, for design, for architecture.": "Venus",
  "I love architecture.": "Chris",
  "A man of eighty has outlived probably three new schools of painting, two of architecture and poetry and a hundred in dress.": "Lord",
  "I'm very interested in architecture.": "Nikki",
  "I feel I can handle the architecture of dance as well as anybody.": "Twyla",
  "I am exhausted by traditional memoir. I am exhausted by the architecture of the conventional novel.": "David",
  "I mean, certainly writing, painting, photography, dance, architecture, there is an aspect of almost every art form that is useful and that merges into film in some way.": "Sydney",
  "If I want to make people moved or cry in a film, I figure out what the room looks like, what the people are wearing, what time of day it is, what the light is, how to photograph it, where to put the camera. It involves optics and costume design and set design and architecture.": "Sydney",
  "What makes architecture extraordinary is that you're looking at the building, but your peripheral vision is also seeing how it fits within a space. And it's seeing more than one part of the building at one time.": "Sydney",
  "The real architecture happens within the works themselves, and that was done by the composer. That's where the real skill is. In putting together a program, you're more a curator, but that's important as well. And then the interpreting of it is where our big job is.": "Joshua",
  "I'd like to do a lot of things - whether in design or architecture or business.": "Caroline",
  "The idea was that you could grow a system like the Internet one network at a time and then interconnect them. In some sense, the most important thing was the invention of the architecture protocols that enabled the Internet.": "Vint",
  "No architecture is so haughty as that which is simple.": "John",
  "Talking about music is like dancing about architecture.": "Steve",
  "If you have an architecture of control, let's say, where you select in advance everything that's going to affect your life, then you're going to live in a very small world that will have an echo chamber feature... Pandora, which I love, actually feeds into that.": "Cass",
  "It was my interest in happiness that led me to the subject of habits, and of course, the study of habits is really the study of happiness. Habits are the invisible architecture of everyday life, and a significant element of happiness.": "Gretchen",
  "Architecture produces a musical mood in our inner being, and we notice that even though the elements of architecture and music appear to be so alien in the outer world, through this musical mood engendered in us, our experience of architecture brings about a reconciliation, a balance between these two elements.": "Rudolf",
  "Architects of grandeur are often the master builders of disillusionment.": "Bryant",
  "Every problem is super-interesting and has its own nuances, and you solve it today, but you try to solve it with an architecture. You build a machine to solve the problems that are like it later. And then you move on to the next.": "Travis",
  "Noble life demands a noble architecture for noble uses of noble men. Lack of culture means what it has always meant: ignoble civilization and therefore imminent downfall.": "Frank",
  "Convinced as I am and as I am from my government that the world needs a new moral architecture over all I believe that this should be the first topic to debate in our world of today, ethics, moral.": "Hugo",
  "I loved medieval architecture when I was very small I don't know why.": "Andrew",
  "Music, architecture and pictures have always been my passions, and all that material wealth has meant for me, is being able to have some of the pictures I liked.": "Andrew",
  "I love the architecture magazines and all of the French magazines for decoration or whatever. I end up enjoying them more sometimes than the fashion magazines.": "Francois",
  "I remember coming back to the U.K. after spending five months in Charlotte for 'Homeland,' and I just found myself just wandering around London. There's nothing like it - the buildings, the architecture, the sense of history, the sense of culture - there really is nothing like it.": "David",
  "When I visit any cathedral, it reminds me of being with my grandparents. They weren't particularly religious, but my grandfather was obsessed with architecture.": "Jonathan",
  "I really love Miami, but I don't think the architecture matches the city. It's a bit too commercial.": "Zaha",
  "I love antique architecture, so if I have any indulgences, I have owned and renovated and reconstructed a lot of old houses.": "Daryl",
  "The problem of architecture has always been the same throughout time. Its authentic quality is reached through its proportions, and the proportions cost nothing. In fact, most of them are proportions among things, not the things themselves. Art is almost always a question of proportions.": "Ludwig",
  "Architecture depends on facts, but its real field of activity lies in the realm of the significance.": "Ludwig",
  "Never talk to a client about architecture. Talk to him about his children. That is simply good politics. he will not understand what you have to say about architecture most of the time.": "Ludwig",
  "Architecture depends on its time. It is the crystallization of its inner structure, the slow unfolding of its form.": "Ludwig",
  "Not yesterday, not tomorrow, only today can be given form. Only this architecture creates.": "Ludwig",
  "Architecture is always the will of the age conceived as space - nothing else. Until this simple truth is clearly recognized, the struggle over the foundation of a new architecture confident in its aims and powerful in its impact cannot be realized; until then, it is destined to remain a chaos of uncoordinated forces.": "Ludwig",
  "I love Chicago. It's one of the great cities. I'm crazy about the town. It reminds me of New York when it was at its best, the New York that used to be and is no more. I love the architecture, the old stuff and the new stuff.": "Peter",
  "If I weren't involved with food, I'd be working in architecture. Design is that critical to me.": "Alice",
  "Prediction is structurally inseparable from the business of punditry: It creates the essential image of indefatigable authority that is punditry's very architecture; it flows from that calcified image, and it provides the substance for the story that keeps getting told about the inevitability of American progress.": "Rick",
  "Itjtawy was ancient Egypt's capital for over four hundred years, at a period of time called the Middle Kingdom about four thousand years ago. The site is located in the Faiyum of Egypt, and the site is really important because in the Middle Kingdom there was this great renaissance for ancient Egyptian art, architecture and religion.": "Sarah",
  "I try to shut out ideas about why you should do things. Trying to do good architecture and really designing a career? There's some attention to be paid to that, but I don't think it's everything.": "Rachel",
  "There's a Danish architecture firm called BIG. I love architecture, and I always check out their work; they're very good at reimagining the way we live. They put the human experience as the focus, with access to air and outdoor space.": "Nikolaj",
  "When you found a company, you have the original vision, you make all the original decisions, you know every employee, you kind of know every aspect of the product architecture and its limitations.": "Ben",
  "In my early 20s I was so miserable doing construction, I wanted something that paid money. I liked nice stuff. I liked cars and architecture, and things that cost money. I wanted to not swing a hammer, and make money... and not do stuff that was dirty. I attempted to get into comedy. I started to do stand-up, but I wasn't very good at it.": "Adam",
  "The building of the architecture of a novel - the craft of it - is something I never tire of.": "John",
  "The first thing you must know as an actor or director is the space you will inhabit. See the architecture imagine where things can happen in space. ": "Robert",
  "I've always been attracted to classic patterns in architecture, music and drama.": "Robert",
  "The thing is that when you are a director, you need to be involved in a lot of different fields. You must be a psychologist, an architecture expert; you must be a choreographer.": "Denis",
  "I would have liked maybe to be in architecture or painting, something connected to the fine arts.": "Catherine",
  "I do speak Mandarin, and I also relate to the hunger that China has for culture and architecture and style.": "Vera",
  "I love architecture, but I learned early on that architects just don't make a lot of money.": "Shahid",
  "You don't need to spend a lot of money on stuff when you have amazing architecture.": "Nate",
  "Landscape architecture is basically geodesign; it's designing geography. And yet geodesign is not only done by landscape architects, it's done by some of the world's largest corporations.": "Jack",
  "I think it is widely agreed that Carl Steinitz, over the 50 years he taught at Harvard, has been one of the most important figures in influencing the theory and practice of landscape architecture and the application of computer technology to planning.": "Jack",
  "I think people care. If not, why do so many people spend money going on vacations to see architecture? They go to the Parthenon, to Chartres, to the Sydney Opera House. They go to Bilbao... Something compels them, and yet we live surrounded by everything but great architecture.": "Frank",
  "There are a lot of questions about whether architecture is art. The people who ask that think pretty tract houses are architecture. But that doesn't hold up.": "Frank",
  "Chicago's one of the rare places where architecture is more visible.": "Frank",
  "We need a new health care architecture that will reduce costs, improve outcomes, and protect vulnerable persons.": "Jeff",
  "There's a technicality to designing and wearing hats. A hat is balancing the proportions of your face it's like architecture or mathematics. ": "Philip",
  "Great buildings that move the spirit have always been rare. In every case they are unique, poetic, products of the heart.": "Arthur",
  "Whenever we witness art in a building, we are aware of an energy contained by it.": "Arthur",
  "Architecture doesn't come from theory. You don't think your way through a building.": "Arthur",
  "Rationalism is the enemy of art, though necessary as a basis for architecture.": "Arthur",
  "The details are the very source of expression in architecture. But we are caught in a vice between art and the bottom line.": "Arthur",
  "Vitality is radiated from exceptional art and architecture.": "Arthur",
  "Does an architecture to assuage the spirit have a place?": "Arthur",
  "The new architecture of transparency and lightness comes from Japan and Europe.": "Arthur",
  "The way of architecture is the quiet voice that underlies it and has guided it from the beginning.": "Arthur",
  "Today's developer is a poor substitute for the committed entrepreneur of the last century for whom the work of architecture represented a chance to celebrate the worth of his enterprise.": "Arthur",
  "I always point out to my Passover guests that the Hebrews were not living in isolation. They were at the crossroads of several great, elaborate cultures with their own mythology and religion and art and architecture and cultural belief. In fact, so many of the mythologies of the world describe the same events, just from different points of view.": "Harold",
  "I think it's important to approach a house in a way that's reflective of the original environment. Maybe I'm a sentimentalist, but I think that certain geographies call out for certain architecture. I like residences that reflect their place.": "Kelsey",
  "I was always really geeky about design and buildings. Always into architecture as a kid.": "Aldis",
  "I've always known I wanted to be in design somehow. It was going to be architecture, but I would've had to quit acting for it. I realized with horology, I could learn at my own pace.": "Aldis",
  "When you're in a creative flow with somebody - and I had this back in architecture school - you're just so passionate about what you're doing, and if that other person is just as passionate, you'll be madly in love with them. It's just that thrill of creating.": "Catherine",
  "It was nice to finish up Stanford. I think I always felt that I would be there for four years and graduate, and definitely didn't want to leave early. A degree was definitely a plus, and I was having a lot of fun in school. But after football, you know, I don't know. I really did enjoy studying architecture; it was a blast.": "Andrew",
  "I believe very strongly, and have fought since many years ago - at least over 30 years ago - to get architecture not just within schools, but architecture talked about under history, geography, science, technology, art.": "Richard",
  "Architecture is a slow business, and city planning even slower.": "Richard",
  "Architecture is a living thing. If I want to leave something to the future, it has to be able to change - but retain something of the ethos that we built up over 50 years.": "Richard",
  "Architecture is always political.": "Richard",
  "Chandeliers are marvels of drop-dead showiness, the jewellery of architecture.": "Peter",
  "By the late Nineties, we had become a more visual nation. Big-money taste moved to global standards - new architecture, design and show-off contemporary art. The Sloane domestic aesthetic - symmetry, class symbolism and brown furniture - became as unfashionable as it had been hot in the early Eighties.": "Peter",
  "The art of dancing stands at the source of all the arts that express themselves first in the human person. The art of building, or architecture, is the beginning of all the arts that lie outside the person; and in the end they unite.": "Havelock",
  "The architecture for 'Paladin' - given that it's at least three books, with the possibility of more - turned out to be bigger than anything I've ever created, with multiple levels of reality, interlocking mysteries and a terabyte of time frame.": "Mark",
  "Our overriding goal in restructuring our financial architecture should be that taxpayers never again have to save a failing financial institution.": "Henry",
  "I like the architecture of lingerie.": "Colleen",
  "As a general rule, when a new industry takes root, and the first products emerge in a wave, almost always the architecture of the product will be proprietary and interdependent in character.": "Clayton",
  "The British political system and the whole clapped out Westminster architecture, and the language that we use about politics, it's completely unsustainable. You either decide to be part of that transition to do something different. Or you cling to old certainties.": "Nick",
  "Architecture and building is about how you get around the obstacles that are presented to you. That sometimes determines how successful you'll be: How good are you at going around obstacles?": "Jeremy",
  "I got a New York designer to build my dream store here, which is a little bit of Florence in New York. It's like the Duomo on Madison. I got inspired by Santa Maria Novella and all the Renaissance architecture.": "Edgardo",
  "Architecture was pretty much the sexiest thing to be doing from 1700-1800.": "Kevin",
  "Even though I build buildings and I pursue my architecture, I pursue it as an artist. I deliberately keep a tiny studio. I don't want to be an architectural firm. I want to remain an artist.": "Maya",
  "The process I go through in the art and the architecture, I actually want it to be almost childlike. Sometimes I think it's magical.": "Maya",
  "There is no sadder tale in the annals of architecture than the virtual disappearance of the defining architectural form of the Modern Movement - publicly sponsored housing.": "Martin",
  "The truth be told, the World Trade Center was neither a very good work of architecture nor a very successful piece of urbanism. Its shortcomings were somewhat mitigated by the westward and southward expansion of the World Financial Center and Battery Park City during the 1980s.": "Martin",
  "Our subliminal mental processes operate outside awareness because they arise in these portions of our mind that are inaccessible to our conscious self their inaccessibility is due to the architecture of the brain rather than because they have been subject to Freudian motivational forces like repression. ": "Leonard",
  "Art is very tricky because it's what you do for yourself. It's much harder for me to make those works than the monuments or the architecture.": "Maya",
  "Few developments central to the history of art have been so misrepresented or misunderstood as the brief, brave, glorious, doomed life of the Bauhaus - the epochally influential German art, architecture, crafts, and design school that was founded in Goethe's sleepy hometown of Weimar in 1919.": "Martin",
  "By 1970, the first stirrings of the revolt against Modernist orthodoxy in architecture had been felt, although it would be several years more until Postmodernism was widely accepted and made classical motifs permissible in high-style building design for the first time in decades.": "Martin",
  "I left science, then I went into art, but I approach things very analytically. I choose to pursue both art and architecture as completely separate fields rather than merging them.": "Maya",
  "I loved logic, math, computer programming. I loved systems and logic approaches. And so I just figured architecture is this perfect combination.": "Maya",
  "Considering my specialization in architecture, I'm not surprised that the first graphic novel to thoroughly engage, not to say captivate, me is Chip Kidd and Dave Taylor's 'Batman: Death by Design.'": "Martin",
  "Truly great architecture always transcends its stated function, sometimes in unanticipated ways.": "Martin",
  "Cost overruns are not uncommon in architecture, particularly for designs that depart from structural or technological norms, or demand a finer quality of execution than commercial schemes - conditions typical of buildings for cultural institutions. Budgets are exceeded for many reasons, not all of them within an architect's control.": "Martin",
  "One of the stated goals of the postmodern movement in architecture was a greater sensitivity to the people who live in or use newly designed buildings.": "Martin",
  "Architecture was the last of the major professions to devise a formal 'cursus honorum' before its practice could be undertaken.": "Martin",
  "The tall building, concentrating man in one place more densely than ever before, similarly concentrates the dilemma of our public architecture at the end of the twentieth century: whether the new forms made possible by technology are doomed by the low calculations of modern patrons and their architects.": "Martin",
  "To come to England in the 1970s was to return to this strange other-world of half-known history. I found the imperial architecture curiously familiar: the post office, the town hall, the botanic gardens.": "Romesh",
  "I founded a club, which is called the Brutally Early Club. It's basically a breakfast salon for the 21st century where art meets science meets architecture meets literature.": "Hans-Ulrich",
  "I read whenever possible, and I buy books all the time, sometimes online, but mostly from bookshops. I love literature. If you want to understand art, it's important to understand what is also happening in literature, in music, in science, in architecture.": "Hans-Ulrich",
  "I'm often called an old-fashioned modernist. But the modernists had the absurd idea that architecture could heal the world. That's impossible. And today nobody expects architects to have these grand visions any more.": "Thom",
  "Do I provoke as a method of investigation? Of course. That's the essence of architecture. Do I do it with gusto? I do.": "Thom",
  "I fought violently for the autonomy of architecture. It's a very passive, weak profession where people deliver a service. You want a blue door, you get a blue door. You want it to look neo-Spanish, you get neo-Spanish. Architecture with any authenticity represents resistance. Resistance is a good thing.": "Thom",
  "I've always been interested in an architecture of resistance - architecture that has some power over the way we live. Working under adversarial conditions could be seen as a plus because you're offering alternatives. Still, there are situations that make you ask the questions: 'Do I want to be a part of this?'": "Thom",
  "The aesthetic of architecture has to be rooted in a broader idea about human activities like walking, relaxing and communicating. Architecture thinks about how these activities can be given added value.": "Thom",
  "You might say that when you step inside, you're entering a honorific space, but that's something totally different than experiencing it. And in architecture the experience comes first. That has the deepest effect on us.": "Thom",
  "In architecture, you arrive so late. I look at doctors, lawyers I know, and they're all buying boats and bailing out at 62. My career is just getting started.": "Thom",
  "I don't know any architects that I respect who don't have their own voice. I think the difference between architecture and the other arts is your immersion in reality.": "Thom",
  "Architecture is the beginning of something because it's - if you're not involved in first principles, if you're not involved in the absolute, the beginning of that generative process, it's cake decoration.": "Thom",
  "Somehow, architecture alters the way we think about the world and the way we behave. Any serious architecture, as a litmus test, has to be that.": "Thom",
  "Architecture is the story of how we see ourselves. It is the architect's job to service everyday life.": "Thom",
  "Being interested in other fields and meeting experts outside entertainment - whether it's a two-hour conversation with John Nash that turns into 'A Beautiful Mind' or talking to people in architecture or fashion, CIA directors or Nobel laureates - has given me a better sense of which ideas feel authentic and new.": "Brian",
  "'Harlem: The Unmaking of a Ghetto' is a surprise and a fresh way of looking at Harlem, connecting the black district with the architecture of its historical past.": "Darryl",
  "As a viewer, that's work I respond to - work that I know is singular in some way. If I'm being challenged by something on screen, if I don't quite know why it's happening, I want to know I can do the work of pulling it apart and that there'll be something satisfactory about it. If the architecture is sound, you can be lyrical in execution.": "Shane",
  "I cannot imagine myself fitting into the existing curriculum. I am too self-willed for that and have had my own very definite ideas for a long time, very different from the existing ways, as to how architecture is to be taught.": "Walter",
  "The development of the New Architecture encountered serious obstacles at a very early stage of its development. Conflicting theories and the dogmas enunciated in architects' personal manifestos all helped to confuse the main issue.": "Walter",
  "The general public, formerly profoundly indifferent to everything to do with building, has been shaken out of its torpor; personal interest in architecture as something that concerns every one of us in our daily lives has been very widely aroused; and the broad line of its future development are already clearly discernible.": "Walter",
  "I see the Beijing National Stadium as an architectural project. I accepted Herzog and De Meuron's invitation to collaborate on the design, and our proposal won the competition. From beginning to end, I stayed with the project. I am committed to fostering relationships between a city and its architecture.": "Ai",
  "For a long time, nobody had figured out Information Architecture, so we all just made stuff up.": "Jeffrey",
  "What people want, above all, is order.": "Stephen",
  "Victorian architecture in the United States was copied straight from England.": "Stephen",
  "French architecture always manages to combine the most magnificent underlying themes of architecture; like Roman design, it looks to the community.": "Stephen",
  "The logic of Palladian architecture presented an aesthetic formula which could be applied universally.": "Stephen",
  "The Egyptian contribution to architecture was more concerned with remembering the dead than the living.": "Stephen",
  "Of all the lessons most relevant to architecture today, Japanese flexibility is the greatest.": "Stephen",
  "Georgian architecture respected the scale of both the individual and the community.": "Stephen",
  "I'm somebody who likes codes and ciphers and chases and artwork and architecture, and all the things you find in a Robert Langdon thriller.": "Dan",
  "The only job that was ever of interest to me other than filmmaking is architecture.": "Christopher",
  "Concrete you can mold, you can press it into - after all, you haven't any straight lines in your body. Why should we have straight lines in our architecture? You'd be surprised when you go into a room that has no straight line - how marvelous it is that you can feel the walls talking back to you, as it were.": "Philip",
  "We all love musical architecture there's no doubt about that.": "Levon",
  "The thing about Chicago is that it really isn't like any other place. The architecture and the layout of the city are the best. I'm from the Midwest, and consider myself a Midwesterner. I feel most at home there. I love California. I have great friends in California. I just have always considered Illinois to be home.": "Vince",
  "I want to abolish time, especially in the contemplation of architecture.": "Piet",
  "Until the Eighties, Oslo was a rather boring town, but it's changed a lot, and is now much more cosmopolitan. If I go downtown, I visit the harbour to see the tall ships and the ferries, and to admire the modern architecture such as the Opera House or the new Astrup Fearnley Museum on the water's edge.": "Jo",
  "London, from the architecture to the culture to the fashion to the accents, feels like it's a special place.": "G-Eazy",
  "I have at last admitted that not only was I angry with my mother, but, in fact, I wanted to destroy her as a child. And I was so concerned to be a woman who was different from my mother that I had this vast architecture of rules.": "Kathryn",
  "As the OLPC laptop was getting ready to go into mass production in 2007, many executives approached me wanting the screen that I invented, and the laptop architecture that I co-invented, for their new laptops, cell phones, and other devices.": "Mary",
  "When Washington visited Portsmouth in 1789, he was not much impressed by the architecture of the little town that had stood by him so stoutly in the struggle for independence.": "Thomas",
  "In retrospect, the pace of change in the arts and industry in the nineteenth century seems pretty glacial. Painting, music, the novel, architecture were all evolving, but at a pretty observable pace.": "Amor",
  "I always wanted to be an actor, but I always loved design, and growing up in New Orleans there was such great style, great architecture. I would decorate my little apartment in New York over and over again, because it only had a couple of rooms. And I did it for friends and family on the side just for fun.": "Bryan",
  "There's something very special about seeing history so clearly in front of you through that architecture that you just don't get in the U.S. If I was asked to choose where I'd most like to live, I would always choose London.": "Charlie",
  "After my schooling, I was not thrilled by the idea of treading the usual doctor-engineer line. I wanted to pursue something artistic, and I was good at drawing. The options before me were architecture, fashion, and interior designing.": "Keerthy",
  "Any architectural project we do takes at least four or five years, so increasingly there is a discrepancy between the acceleration of culture and the continuing slowness of architecture.": "Rem",
  "Escape from the architecture ghetto is one of the major drivers and has been from the very beginning.": "Rem",
  "The intellectual force of the West is still dominant, but other cultures are getting stronger. I expect that we will develop a new way of thinking in architecture and urban planning, and that less will be based on our models.": "Rem",
  "Architecture is a rare collective profession: it's always exercised by groups. There is an essential modesty, which is a complete contradiction to the notion of a star.": "Rem",
  "There's nothing Dutch about my architecture.": "Rem",
  "I absorbed as many Impressionist paintings as I could, in Parisian museums and in many museums in the United States and in books, looking for clues to architecture, clothing, settings.": "Susan",
  "I graduated from university with a degree in architecture and then ended up doing a series of internships with different firms. And once I was in an office environment, I realized that at school what I was doing was 98 percent creative, 2 percent makework, but in the real world, it was the other way around.": "Daniel",
  "Living in Edinburgh, I consider myself particularly lucky - we have the biggest book festival in the world, a plethora of fascinating libraries and museums, and some of the greatest architecture in Europe.": "Sara",
  "A city building, you experience when you walk; a suburban building, you experience when you drive.": "Helmut",
  "It's my goal to make a building as immaterial as possible. Architecture is a very material thing. It takes a lot of resources, so why not eliminate what you don't need as long as you're able to achieve the same result?": "Helmut",
  "I strive for an architecture from which nothing can be taken away.": "Helmut",
  "The architecture profession has lost a lot of its integrity, especially in the USA. The general architect here has no scruples, no ambitions.": "Helmut",
  "All those involved in the construction of an architectural design, from the architect to the builder, have an attachment to the architecture, although it's difficult to quantify the attachment.": "Tadao",
  "I would like my architecture to inspire people to use their own resources, to move into the future.": "Tadao",
  "Italy is full of historical buildings. And Europe holds a great history of philosophy from Greece until today. I read all those books and see these buildings, and I think of where I stand when I design my architecture.": "Tadao",
  "Japanese architecture is traditionally based on wooden structures that need renovating on a regular basis.": "Tadao",
  "Since I am a Japanese man who's been building through the experience of Japanese architecture, my actual designs come from Japanese architectural concepts, although they're based on Western methods and materials.": "Tadao",
  "My guilty pleasure is I like to watch a lot of HGTV. I really like watching design shows about houses, like extreme homes. Like buying a bridge and turning it into a house or something like that. I really am interested in home design or something like that... architecture.": "Taylor",
  "We think of enterprise architecture as the process we use for fully describing and mapping business functionality and business requirements and relating them to information systems requirements.": "Tony",
  "Melrose is the finest remaining specimen of Gothic architecture in Scotland. Some of the sculptured flowers in the cloister arches are remarkably beautiful and delicate, and the two windows - the south and east oriels - are of a lightness and grace of execution really surprising.": "Bayard",
  "I've spent a lot of very happy times in Edinburgh as a result of playing virtually every festival since 1996. It's also a beautiful city in its own right, is walkable, within sight of the sea and mountains - and was too far north for the Luftwaffe to have done any damage, hence the spectacularly beautiful architecture.": "Marcus",
  "I'm inspired by many things, from landscapes to textiles. Art and architecture always influence my design process.": "Francisco",
  "Of the individual poems, some are more lyric and some are more descriptive or narrative. Each poem is fixed in a moment. All those moments written or read together take on the movement and architecture of a narrative.": "Marilyn",
  "I find the aristocratic parts of London so unattractive and angular; the architecture is so white and gated. But in New York, it's different - even uptown it's really grand, and there's no real segregation there. It's all mixed up.": "Imogen",
  "I love architecture almost as much as I love my musicals.": "Cameron",
  "You are a victim of your own neural architecture which doesn't permit you to imagine anything outside of three dimensions. Even two dimensions. People know they can't visualise four or five dimensions, but they think they can close their eyes and see two dimensions. But they can't.": "Leonard",
  "I worked out a rather deep-dish theory defining the theater as a form of architecture rather than a form of literature.": "Preston",
  "The Classic games were Classic because, like classical music or architecture, they strove to give life and weight to ideals of order and proportion, to provide a vision of timelessness. In 'Double Dragon,' we can see the cracks in the brick, the mold growing on the drainage pipes, the unmistakable deterioration of the world we live in.": "D.",
  "The architecture of a story can be a little bit different if it's a true story.": "Joel",
  "I have no requirements for a style of architecture.": "Michael",
  "I taught at Princeton for 39 years, and the school of architecture on the campus is the worst building on the campus.": "Michael",
  "Instead of using the machine as a metaphor for architecture, as Le Corbusier did, I use the human body. I want the public to know that it's them I'm designing for.": "Michael",
  "The oldest book I have is a treatise on architecture from the 17th century.": "Michael",
  "The dialogue of architecture has been centered too long around the idea of truth.": "Michael",
  "For my first apartment, when I was first married, I went to the lumberyard and bought stuff and made couches. My then-wife made cushions. I was really very interested in furniture. I was in school for architecture, but I had to live, and making furniture was different from designing buildings, which I couldn't do for myself.": "Michael",
  "I'm working on a school of architecture in China. It's rare that an architect gets to design a school of architecture, and here I get to do it. I'm so pleased that they asked me.": "Michael",
  "You can never draw enough or read enough - reading about architecture, in other words.": "Michael",
  "Charles was very intent to use his years as Prince of Wales to make his mark while he still had freedom of maneuver that he wouldn't have as King. The first subject he really went for was architecture. It made an impact.": "Anthony",
  "Post-Modernism was a reaction against Modernism. It came quite early to music and literature, and a little later to architecture. And I think it's still coming to computer science.": "Larry",
  "The 20th century is a period defined by cultural and artistic movements. However, the 21st century creative-scape that we occupy now doesn't really have movements in the same way. Instead it's made up of diverse individuals working across various platforms simultaneously; art, architecture, film, music and literature.": "Doug",
  "'Station to Station' came out of a sense of urgency - a sense that culture, be it art, film or architecture, has become so compartmentalised. For this project, we wanted to break that and create a language that is more nomadic and less materialistic and really empowering for the creators and the audience.": "Doug",
  "I have realised how exciting and easy it is to be a time traveller by looking at paintings and films and architecture and playing music or listening to it. I don't think you necessarily have to live in the present all the time.": "Jools",
  "I've never owned an Apple product. I like the fact that PCs are open architecture and not locked down like Apple products. I feel that Macs are also unjustifiably overpriced.": "Oren",
  "Architecture has its place in the concrete world. This is where it exists. This is where it makes its statement.": "Peter",
  "Architecture to me is whole. I cannot say I only care about this 25% and the other 75% I let go... it's just I want to work the way I want to work. In my shop, you can order certain things and other things you cannot. They are not available.": "Peter",
  "People kind of tend to mystify design and architecture by suggesting you need to train.": "Marc",
  "My interest in architecture has always been sculptural. Most of my photography is of architecture.": "Parker",
  "If I was influenced by anything, it was architecture: structure having to do with logic. If you don't do it right, the whole thing is going to cave in. In a certain sense, you can carry that to graphic design. Fortunately, however, nobody is going to die if you do it wrong.": "Paul",
  "I would fix other people's lines if they asked me on occasion. The hard part of writing is the architecture of it, getting the story and structuring it. Not the tweaking of lines.": "William",
  "I love Sutton House in Clapton, a beautiful example of Tudor architecture.": "Sharon",
  "Every one who has a heart, however ignorant of architecture he may be, feels the transcendent beauty and poetry of the mediaeval churches.": "Goldwin",
  "Yet for my part, deeply as I am moved by the religious architecture of the Middle Ages, I cannot honestly say that I ever felt the slightest emotion in any modern Gothic church.": "Goldwin",
  "I would've been intrigued by being a film director. I would've been intrigued by politics. I thought about architecture.": "Charlie",
  "The last thing a young artist should do in poetry or any other field is think about what's in style, what's current, what are the trends. Think instead of what you like to read, what do you admire, what you like to listen to in music. What do you like to look at in architecture? Try to make a poem that has some of those qualities.": "Robert",
  "I take a lot from everywhere. I take from music, architecture, novels, and plays. Anywhere that hits you.": "Alex",
  "I quit college. I was studying architecture for about a year.": "Barry",
  "When I'm in London, Claridge's is a great favourite. I'm a big fan of art deco architecture and the rooms are extraordinary.": "Roman",
  "I studied architecture in New York. So, really I was very moved, like everyone else, to try to contribute something that has that resonance and profundity of it means to all of us.": "Daniel",
  "In fact, it will be very easy to climb the building because of its shape and architecture.": "Alain",
  "Little do we find any Phoenician architecture or plastic art at all comparable even to those of Italy, to say nothing of the lands where art was native.": "Theodor",
  "When I went to school at Emerson, I was completely charmed living there and loved the architecture of the Back Bay.": "Joanna",
  "Architecture tends to consume everything else, it has become one's entire life.": "Arne",
  "If architecture had nothing to do with art, it would be astonishingly easy to build houses, but the architect's task - his most difficult task - is always that of selecting.": "Arne",
  "In addressing a task, one almost always has several possible options, sometimes only a few, and they may all be practical and functional. But they lack the aesthetic aspect that raises it to architecture.": "Arne",
  "So what we have tried to do in our later buildings is to try to be completely consistent, as a painter is consistent or as a sculptor is consistent. Architecture also must be very consistent.": "Minoru",
  "If you examine this, I think that you will find that it's the mechanics of Japanese architecture that have been thought of as the direct influence upon our architecture.": "Minoru",
  "Mies van der Rohe's architecture and modern architecture in general suffered from not only being repetitive, but not explaining to the populous what the different rooms were for.": "Charles",
  "Modern Architecture died in St. Louis, Missouri, on July 15, 1972, at 3.32 p.m. (or thereabouts), when the infamous Pruitt Igoe scheme, or rather several of its slab blocks, were given the final coup de grace by dynamite.": "Charles",
  "I was always fascinated by graphic art and typography and architecture. And so I was constantly cutting things and making blocks and making buildings out of shoeboxes.": "Narciso",
  "Architecture is invention.": "Oscar",
  "Architecture will always express the technical and social progress of the country in which it is carried out. If we wish to give it the human content that it lacks, we must participate in the political struggle.": "Oscar",
  "Architecture is my work, and I've spent my whole life at a drawing board, but life is more important than architecture. What matters is to improve human beings.": "Oscar",
  "You get one chance to do something about native title. You get perhaps one chance in your life to do something about a republic. You get one chance, your chance, to build a piece of the political architecture in the Pacific. I wasn't going to give those up.": "Paul",
  "I've always liked traveling around Europe and seeing the architecture. The buildings in capital cities have been there for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of years. Some look better than the new ones.": "Joe",
  "Building art is a synthesis of life in materialised form. We should try to bring in under the same hat not a splintered way of thinking, but all in harmony together.": "Alvar",
  "We should concentrate our work not only to a separated housing problem but housing involved in our daily work and all the other functions of the city.": "Alvar",
  "God created paper for the purpose of drawing architecture on it. Everything else is, at least for me, an abuse of paper.": "Alvar",
  "The intellectual architecture means focusing on doing great work instead of focusing on agency politics.": "Jay",
  "But those musics do not address the larger kind of architecture in time that classical music does, whatever each one of us knows that classical music must mean.": "Michael",
  "The more centralized the power, the less compromises need to be made in architecture.": "Peter",
  "I am immersed in architecture all day, working in my office or teaching.": "Peter",
  "I don't believe that classical architecture is enough to engage people anymore. They say: 'So what else is new?'": "Peter",
  "At this present time, matter is still the best way to think of architecture, but I'm not so sure for very long. The computer is radicalizing the way we think about our world.": "Ben",
  "If you're into architecture and you're from the West, everything is hors d'oeuvres for working to rebuild the Temple. Ultimately you're led there. You can't escape it.": "Ben",
  "You can just drift unhappily towards this vision of heaven on earth, and ultimately that is what architecture is a vision of: Heaven on earth, at it's best.": "Ben",
  "Britain loves a bargain, but you don't get good, lasting architecture on the cheap.": "David",
  "I don't think architecture is radical. How can something that takes years and costs millions be radical?": "David",
  "I like to be surrounded by books. My wife Evelyn has a Ph.D. in comparative literature, so we have a lot of her Spanish and German literature books which are wasted on me, plus a lot of novels and books on art and architecture shared by us both. Evelyn used to edit an art magazine called 'FMR,' so we have a common interest in design.": "David",
  "A building is no good if someone's got to explain to you why it's good. You can't say you don't know enough about architecture - that's ridiculous. It's got to work on many levels.": "David",
  "As architects we are often involved in the concrete-steel-and-glass aspect of it, but cities are social structures, and to be involved in imagining the future of cities and the type of relationships and the types of places that we're making is something that intrigues me very much.": "Michael",
  "Architecture should be rooted in the past, and yet be part of our own time and forward looking.": "Moshe",
  "Architecture is changing faster than some other professions.": "Moshe",
  "There is a profound ethic to architecture which is different from the other arts.": "Moshe",
  "Architecture has joined the world of fashion, but fashion is passing and architecture is timeless.": "Moshe",
  "Architecture students are generally given theoretical projects, often located at distant locations, and told to come up with a design.": "Alan",
  "Modern architecture needed to be part of an evolutionary, not a revolutionary, process.": "I.",
  "I think the artistic side of architecture was natural to me. My mother was an artist and a poet.": "I.",
  "I've never left China. My family's been there for 600 years. But my architecture is not consciously Chinese in any sense. I'm a western architect.": "I.",
  "I came, I studied architecture in America, so my technical background's completely western. But my seventeen years, the formative years of one's life, and I can't say that the Chineseness in me is not there.": "I.",
  "I've always been interested in art, architecture, color.": "Lee",
  "Architecture is about aging well, about precision and authenticity. There is much more to the success of a building than what you can see. I'm not suggesting that gestural architecture is always superficial, but solid reasoning has its place.": "Annabelle",
  "One of my favorite vacation places is Miami, because of the people, the water and the beach - of course - and the architecture on Miami Beach is so wonderful.": "Oksana",
  "Society understands the architecture of academia and knows there are relevant qualifications in different fields, and the media accepts the idea of specialisations and accords greater respect to those with greater expertise. With one exception: climate science.": "Jay",
  "There's no architect who doesn't want to build a library - and I am no different. With so much scrutiny now attached to reading - because of technology and how we approach it as a social activity - that is a very exciting area in architecture.": "Annabelle",
  "Tension is an interesting quality - and architecture must have it. There should be elements of the inexplicable, the mysterious, and the poetic in something that is perfectly rational.": "Annabelle",
  "The secret of good architecture is having more than meets the eye.": "Annabelle",
  "Downtown Toronto is a very good place to talk about the neutrality of modernist architecture. I'm sure this kind of box-building was interesting in the Twenties, Thirties and Forties, but I think it's absolutely ridiculous to build like this in 2013.": "Stefan",
  "Trying to describe something musical is like dancing to architecture, it's really difficult.": "Robert",
  "I went to school for engineering, I studied jazz. So I always had this kind of creative side and technical side, and I thought architecture might be the way to combine them, so I went to architecture school in New York.": "Joseph",
  "Once I got out of architecture school I decided not to be an architect, I just started my own little design studio.": "Joseph",
  "You don't have to spend much time in Shanghai before you start to get all existential about the meaning of authenticity. Did you know that Shanghai is building nine satellite towns, each designed to mimic the architecture and culture of a different country?": "Patricia",
  "Zaha Hadid's Maxxi Museum is proof that Rome and contemporary architecture are no longer a paradox. The building is characteristic Hadid - with curving lines and organic shapes - and the permanent collection already boasts works by Francesco Clemente, William Kentridge, and Gerhard Richter.": "Amanda",
  "Blockchain technology isn't just a more efficient way to settle securities. It will fundamentally change market structures, and maybe even the architecture of the Internet itself.": "Abigail",
  "Doctrines provide an architecture for both Republican and Democrat presidents to carry out policies.": "Malcolm",
  "That Moorish architecture is all over the place, of course. It affects me everywhere I see it, as it does so many people. But Brand Library was a special place to me, and I know I've paid homage to it many times in my drawings.": "Jim",
  "As a child, I always enjoyed building forts by stringing up bed sheets and clothes. I continue to be inspired by makeshift structures, including my own kids' forts and temporary architecture of all sorts.": "Janet",
  "I never studied sculpture, engineering or architecture. In fact, after college I applied to seven art schools and was rejected by all seven.": "Janet",
  "In a place like the Greek Theater in L.A., to try and create a close connection with the audience seems almost antithetical to the architecture of the building.": "Alex",
  "People are moving into modes of participation and self-generation, which apply to everything from museums and television to architecture.": "Jake",
  "The same sort of thing happened in my dispute with the National Trust book: Follies: A National Trust Guide, which implied that the only pleasure you can get from Folly architecture is by calling the architect mad, and by laughing at the architecture.": "Ian",
  "Modernist architecture and town planning is inimical to human beings... based on the Darwinian concept that evolution is open ended, that there must always be something new and better.": "Leon",
  "If a dictator takes up my ideas, the resulting town will survive the political system that commissioned it and stand as a social good. Besides, modernism rather than classicism has dominated the architecture of totalitarian regimes of both the left and right.": "Leon",
  "You need a prince to make a town in an intellectual sense. Developers want to make money. If they cared about architecture, they'd become architects. I've had so many projects that never came off because they had no sponsor, and not because they were utopian. I just want to build a town that's normal.": "Leon",
  "I don't build because I am an architect. I can make true architecture because I do not build.": "Leon",
  "I think architecture is rarely the product of a single ideology. It's more like it can be shaped by a really big idea. It can accommodate a lot of life forms.": "Bjarke",
  "Architecture is restricted to such a limited vocabulary. A building is either a high-rise or a perimeter block or a town house.": "Bjarke",
  "The work of art shows people new directions and thinks of the future. The house thinks of the present.": "Adolf",
  "I was a student at Columbia College, actually, in the Architecture school. Paul would drive in from Queens, showing me these new songs. I can't remember us working it out.": "Art",
  "But I feel truly wowed by the architecture and the meaning of the architecture if you get lost in it and think about the man hours in the smallest little chapel, and the love involved. God it's fantastic.": "Paul",
  "What's fascinating about D.C., the exteriors are these elaborate structures, this gorgeous architecture and beautiful stonework, and then you go inside and it's crap-looking - apart from the White House, which is beautiful.": "Tony",
  "I think I went to Italy initially for the art, architecture, food and history, but I stayed there because of the people in Cortona.": "Frances",
  "Architecture is a discourse; everything is a discourse. Fashion discourse is actually a micro-discourse, because it's centered around the body. It is the most rapidly developing form of discourse.": "Nate",
  "I love walking along Leith's waterfront and wandering around some of New Town's beautiful streets and squares, with their gorgeous Georgian architecture.": "Dexter",
  "Sand dunes are almost like ready-made buildings in a way. All we need to do is solidify the parts that we need to be solid, and then excavate the sand, and we have our architecture. We can either excavate it by hand, or we can have the wind excavate it for us.": "Magnus",
  "Church architecture describes visually the idea of the sacred, which is a fundamental need of man.": "Mario",
  "The Academy of Architecture in Mendrisio comes from afar. Our land has a millennial history of emigrations: master masons, architects, builders, decorators, plasterers, artists from the world of building.": "Mario",
  "In 1996, I took advantage of some favourable circumstances to propose to the state of the Ticino Canton the foundation of the Academy of Architecture and, with it, an Italian-speaking university in Switzerland.": "Mario",
  "Buildings in modern cities have lost their metaphoric aspect. Much contemporary architecture is very fragmented and busy on the outside. It's like a skin or a skull, but you don't know what's inside.": "Mario",
  "I live in a craftsman house, but I'm a big fan of modernist and mid-century furniture and architecture, too. But my dream is to do a truly original chair design, something that is all these different things but is my own, too.": "Luke",
  "When I write now I do not invent situation, characters, or actions, but rather structures and discursive forms, textual groupings which are combined according to secret affinities among themselves, as in architecture or the plastic arts.": "Juan",
  "Architecture is undistinguished, sometimes derelict, but occasionally, as in 'Post and Beam,' there is something arresting in a setting... the building behind the Cathedral.": "Edith",
  "But after the time there I'd had it with fashion again, so I left to go to architecture school in a summer course at Harvard, which didn't last very long.": "Stephen",
  "I would like to attend college in the future when I have time. I have always been interested in architecture, so perhaps I would pursue a degree in that or business.": "James",
  "When I started designing in school, I discovered that I had a knack for it. I fell completely in love with architecture, and I remain in love with it.": "Cesar",
  "I always look forward to the next project. That is one of the wonderful things about architecture - you always can hope for another project to design.": "Cesar",
  "Architecture adds dimensions to my life that would be impossible to acquire if I retired. The beautiful thing about architecture is that every project is brand new. I am forced to renew myself with every project. Isn't that wonderful?": "Cesar",
  "To go back to architecture, what's organic about architecture as a field, unlike product design, is this whole issue of holism and of monumentality is really our realm. Like, we have to design things which are coherent as a single object, but also break down into small rooms and have an identity of both the big scale and the small scale.": "Greg",
  "I have an architecture degree; that's what my college degree is in. And that sucked. I started doing Web and CD-ROM development really early on, and then that grew into being an art director and doing advertising work.": "Jonathan",
  "I think in America there's this free flow between fashion, art, architecture, music and design. In Europe, it's more segregated between those different disciplines, I think.": "Marco",
  "Newport Center has become a Mediterranean town. The climate here is the same as the Mediterranean's, and so is the architecture. This center exudes a radiance, an energy. It will become a special way of life for everyone.": "Donald",
  "Besides numerous science courses, I had the opportunity to study philosophy, the history of architecture, economics, and Russian history in courses taught by extraordinarily knowledgeable professors.": "Stanley",
  "There was an age, however, when the transition from savagery to civilization, with all its impressive outward manifestations in art and architecture, took place for the first time.": "James",
  "I don't find Hollywood interesting, so I'm thinking of studying architecture instead.": "Hayden",
  "I practised as an architect for 10 years. I qualified in 1973 with a fellowship diploma of architecture. World Series Cricket gave me the freedom to go out and pursue architecture.": "Max",
  "About 1998, when 'Wide World of Sports' and the 'Footy Show' came to an end for me, I couldn't type. When I started architecture, it was a very aesthetic, creative, an almost art process, where lettering and thick line were how you expressed yourself on the paper.": "Max",
  "I am a failed architect, if I'm honest. I got a degree in art history and was about to get another degree, in architecture, but realized I would be terrible at building things because I've got really bad spatial awareness.": "Hannah",
  "The Romans were not inventors of the supporting arch, but its extended use in vaults and intersecting barrel shapes and domes is theirs.": "Harry",
  "After about the first Millennium, Italy was the cradle of Romanesque architecture, which spread throughout Europe, much of it extending the structural daring with minimal visual elaboration.": "Harry",
  "Architecture is a ride - a physical ride and an intellectual ride.": "Antoine",
  "I started collecting aerial photographs of Native American and South Pacific architecture; only the African ones were fractal. And if you think about it, all these different societies have different geometric design themes that they use. So Native Americans use a combination of circular symmetry and fourfold symmetry.": "Ron",
  "After World War II great strides were made in modern Japanese architecture, not only in advanced technology, allowing earthquake resistant tall buildings, but expressing and infusing characteristics of traditional Japanese architecture in modern buildings.": "Harry",
  "You look at the steamboat, the railroad, the car, the airplane - not all of these were invented in the Anglo-American world, but they were popularized and extended by it. They were made possible by the financial architecture, the capital intensive operations invented and developed by the Anglo-Americans.": "Walter",
  "I think that narrative, fiction filmmaking is the culmination of several art forms: theater, art history, architecture. Whereas doc filmmaking is more pure cinema, like cinema verite is film in its purest form.": "George",
  "I like to think about machines and technology in relation to landscape and architecture.": "Antoine",
  "I didn't know what architecture was except that I lived in a house. I don't even think that I knew the word for a long time. My dad funneled me into engineering because it was his background.": "Antoine",
  "My assumption was that all indigenous architecture would be more fractal. My reasoning was that all indigenous architecture tends to be organized from the bottom up. As it turns out, though, my reasoning was wrong.": "Ron",
  "When Europeans first came to Africa, they considered the architecture very disorganized and thus primitive. It never occurred to them that the Africans might have been using a form of mathematics that they hadn't even discovered yet.": "Ron",
  "The bungalow had more to do with how Americans live today than any other building that has gone remotely by the name of architecture in our history.": "Russell",
  "I think architecture, to be really intense and fulfilling, doesn't have to be large.": "Steven",
  "Information and inspiration are everywhere... history, art, architecture, everything an illustrator needs. Europe is, after all, the land that has generated most of the enduring myths and legends of Western culture.": "John",
  "The Internet has created an incredible democratization of the architecture industry.": "Cameron",
  "I have a strong sense that every project is an invention, which is not a word I hear being used in architecture courses.": "Thomas",
  "Perhaps because my town was so naturally gothic in its architecture and relative isolation - the roads often closed in winter - my stories tended toward the ghostly and the creepily suspenseful right from the get-go.": "Andrew",
  "Architecture, of all the arts, is the one which acts the most slowly, but the most surely, on the soul.": "Ernest",
  "I never talked about architecture with my father, which I regret.": "Bernard",
  "The general public will almost always stand behind the traditionalists. In the public eye, architecture is about comfort, about shelter, about bricks and mortar.": "Bernard",
  "There is a lot of interest in the arts, music, theatre, filmmaking, engineering, architecture and software design. I think we have now transitioned the modern-day version of the entrepreneur into the creative economy.": "John",
  "Ever since childhood, I've been interested in history and myth. Not just the facts and figures of the past, but everything that contributes to shape our perception of an age: architecture, art, literature and so forth.": "Anne",
  "To me, the fashion and architecture I like are very closely linked. Both should be clean and simple and without embellishment.": "Leon",
  "No architect troubled to design houses that suited people who were to live in them, because that would have meant building a whole range of different houses. It was far cheaper and, above all, timesaving to make them identical.": "Michael",
  "Everything man is doing in architecture is to try to go against nature. Of course we have to understand nature to know how far we have to go against nature. The secret, I think, of the future is not doing too much. All architects have the tendency to do too much.": "Frei",
  "When I was in architecture school at Princeton, the worst thing you could say about someone was that they were eclectic.": "Hugh",
  "Theater publicly reveals the human condition through appealing to both intellect and emotion. Architecture, whether lowly or exalted, can do the same.": "Hugh",
  "I have a traditional view of the afterlife... heaven, hell and judgments. But the accounts of those places are scant, and I believe it's on purpose. We aren't supposed to try to figure out the architecture of the afterlife, since the big game is here in this life.": "Doug",
  "The overall experience Skype provided was superior to other folks because of the underlying architecture and the ability to provide a superior experience.": "Danny",
  "We don't believe we've solved the multicore-programming problem. But we think we've built an environment in which a certain class of problems can take advantage of the multicore architecture.": "Rob",
  "At a certain point, I just put the building and the art impulse together. I decided that building was a legitimate way to make sculpture.": "Martin",
  "I wanted to be a pilot, but I was always drawing bodies. When I realised I wanted to pursue something creative, my parents pushed me towards architecture.": "Hussein",
  "The show is called 'The Office,' and while it focuses on the people, the architecture of the space is very important.": "Brian",
  "Music, first of all, is completely about abstraction, which is exactly what architecture is not. In a way, it has been incredibly constructive to know what true abstraction is. So you don't fall into the trap of thinking that what you do is abstract.": "Rafael",
  "Opera, next to Gothic architecture, is one of the strangest inventions of Western man. It could not have been foreseen by any logical process.": "Kenneth",
  "Every song, the title dictates the architecture of the song.": "Sammy",
  "I'm involved in everything from highly progressive lighting systems to airline interiors. In the field of transportation I can go from the micro to the macro: architecture, transportation, industrial product design, right across the board. It's Russian dollism, because they all interrelate: one goes into the other.": "Ross",
  "Architects have created this fake separation between creation and execution. You can see it in architecture schools, where the students look down on going to contracts classes.": "Joshua",
  "Some people think architecture is about the genius sketch I don't. Great architecture is a collaboration among a lot of people over a long period of time.": "Joshua",
  "Working off one genius sketch is not the way great architecture should be made.": "Joshua",
  "For many years, I have lived uncomfortably with the belief that most planning and architectural design suffers for lack of real and basic purpose. The ultimate purpose, it seems to me, must be the improvement of mankind.": "James",
  "I went to art school in Chicago for a year at Columbia College. I had this whole master plan of getting into sustainable development and green architecture and construction, so I wanted to go to business school and then get my masters in construction and development.": "Nico",
  "We need to rediscover the essence of the meaning of 'the use.' Architecture is, above all, here for a better living. Every gesture, every shape must be justified by various reasons that would reinforce their reason to be, their use, and will give more sense to their beauty.": "Christian",
  "When I was 18, I lived in Greenwich Village, New York, for nine months. At that time, I wanted to change the world, not through architecture, but through painting. I lived the artist's life, mingling with poets and writers, and working as a waiter. I was intrigued by the aliveness of the city.": "Christian",
  "In the '60s when I was a student, there was this campaign to destroy 75 percent of the old buildings in Paris, replacing them with modern architecture. I realized this as a dangerous utopia. This modern vision did not understand the richness of the city. Thankfully, such destruction did not happen.": "Christian",
  "Everyone should be able to build, and as long as this freedom to build does not exist, the present-day planned architecture cannot be considered art at all.": "Friedensreich",
  "The frightening thought that what you draw may become a building makes for reasoned lines.": "Saul",
  "What has happened to architecture since the second world war that the only passers-by who can contemplate it without pain are those equipped with a white stick and a dog?": "Bernard",
  "I had it drummed into me from an early age that personalizing everything was not a good thing. Besides, I don't think that kind of commodity-driven system makes for the most productive architecture.": "James",
  "I went into architecture a little as 'Peck's Bad Boy.' It allowed me to be a critic in a socially condoned way.": "James",
  "I don't think architecture should be considered as an art form in the first instance. Whenever I say that, it makes people really angry. But this is a very political profession in the Grecian sense. I believe there have to be reasons for every building, and that the ideas should not be self-referential.": "James",
  "I've always seen architecture as a healing art, not just as a beautification art.": "James",
  "My mother took me to Venice one time and showed me all the houses where famous composers used to live. It gave me a fascination for music and the city, but also for architecture. It was a valuable lesson.": "Ben",
  "Architecture is politics.": "Mitchell",
  "Architects in the past have tended to concentrate their attention on the building as a static object. I believe dynamics are more important: the dynamics of people, their interaction with spaces and environmental condition.": "John",
  "In my experience, if you have to keep the lavatory door shut by extending your left leg, it's modern architecture.": "Nancy",
  "Architecture was always the plan. I always figured I'd just do theater on the side.": "Michael",
  "Princeton is a sublime undergraduate university. It has a good architecture school.": "Emilio",
  "There are a lot of bad films out there. There's a lot of bad architecture out there, and I think sometimes it takes a lot of time to begin to see what's really good. And I think what the test seems to be is, what really sticks with you. And what really becomes a part of your life.": "Nathaniel",
  "As a child, my father's architecture seemed to me to be industrial in a way. It seemed harsh and kind of chilly; I didn't respond to it.": "Nathaniel",
  "Inherent in architecture, it involves everything in life so that there is absolutely no end to it. By the time you're seventy or eighty, you're still beginning. So, that's the kind of life I've preferred to being the expert at forty and dead, you know.": "John",
  "There will never be great architects or architecture without great patrons.": "Edwin",
  "In architecture, Palladio is the game. It means hard thought all through - if it is labored, it fails.": "Edwin",
  "First, there is the bare beauty of the logs themselves with their long lines and firm curves. Then there is the open charm felt of the structural features which are not hidden under plaster and ornament, but are clearly revealed, a charm felt in Japanese architecture.": "Gustav",
  "I love '70s organic architecture. I am very influenced by the time when I grew up.": "Alexandre",
  "Revived in this country the long forgotten beauties of Gothic architecture.": "James",
  "I have designed the most buildings of any living American architect.": "Alexander",
  "I am but an architectural composer.": "Alexander",
  "Even at the United Nations, where legend has it that the building was designed so that there could be no corner offices, the expanse of glass in individual offices is said to be a dead giveaway as to rank. Five windows are excellent, one window not so great.": "Enid",
  "My university degree is in art and, yes, I do a lot of drawing for all my books. I have a big drafting table set up in a spare bedroom and I cover it with maps and house plans and sketches that I use in the books. Also, I truly love architecture, so that plays a big part in all my books.": "Jude",
  "In L.A., cinema and television might be seen as more interesting places for architecture than ever before.": "Neil",
  "I studied fine arts and architecture, but I decided to move into movie design because I grew up in a small town in the Marche region and spent a lot of time after school in the movie theater.": "Dante",
  "The traditional notion of an architect having a vision of a building and then drawing it either on paper or on a computer and then constructing it isn't really how architecture works, and in reality, the computer has a lot of influence on design.": "Michael",
  "Every human has four endowments - self awareness, conscience, independent will and creative imagination. These give us the ultimate human freedom... The power to choose, to respond, to change.": "Stephen",
  "The greatest gifts you can give your children are the roots of responsibility and the wings of independence.": "Denis",
  "Unlike a drop of water which loses its identity when it joins the ocean, man does not lose his being in the society in which he lives. Man's life is independent. He is born not for the development of the society alone, but for the development of his self.": "B.",
  "Diversity: the art of thinking independently together.": "Malcolm",

  "When people have compassion, friendship, and unity, they speak and think in a constructive way to ensure national independence and prosperity.": "Bhumibol",
  "Follow the path of the unsafe, independent thinker. Expose your ideas to the danger of controversy. Speak your mind and fear less the label of 'crackpot' than the stigma of conformity.": "Thomas",
  "Nothing is more precious than independence and liberty.": "Ho",
  "True individual freedom cannot exist without economic security and independence. People who are hungry and out of a job are the stuff of which dictatorships are made.": "Franklin",
  "We must have constantly present in our minds the difference between independence and liberty. Liberty is a right of doing whatever the laws permit, and if a citizen could do what they forbid he would no longer be possessed of liberty.": "Charles",
  "The United Nations is designed to make possible lasting freedom and independence for all its members.": "Harry",
  "I wanted to be an independent woman, a woman who could pay for her bills, a woman who could run her own life - and I became that woman.": "Diane",
  "I have an independent streak. You know, it's kind of hard to tell a independent woman what to do.": "Betty",
  "True independence and freedom can only exist in doing what's right.": "Brigham",
  "Originality is independence, not rebellion; it is sincerity, not antagonism.": "George",
  "My mother told me to be a lady. And for her, that meant be your own person, be independent.": "Ruth",
  "Financial independence is paramount. My mom always says that when a woman is financially independent, she has the ability to live life on her own terms. I think that was the soundest advice that I ever got. No matter where you go in life or who you get married to, you have to be financially independent - whether you use it or not.": "Priyanka",
  "The important consequences to the American States from this Declaration of Independence, considered as the ground and foundation of a future government, naturally suggest the propriety of proclaiming it in such a manner as that the people may be universally informed of it.": "John",
  "Solitude is independence.": "Hermann",
  "The American Dream is independence and being able to create that dream for yourself.": "Marsha",
  "What then is freedom? The power to live as one wishes.": "Marcus",

  "At the bottom of education, at the bottom of politics, even at the bottom of religion, there must be for our race economic independence.": "Booker",
  "If the citizens of the United States are to turn away from the Communist Manifesto and preserve the purpose of the Declaration of Independence, the U.S. Constitution, and our Bill of Rights, we must first thoroughly reexamine and learn about each of them, and uphold America's founding documents by testing every political action in light of them.": "Chuck",
  "It was by one Union that we achieved our independence and liberties, and by it alone can they be maintained.": "James",
  "It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance. This is the sentiment embodied in that Declaration of Independence.": "Abraham",

  "The bedrock of our democracy is the rule of law and that means we have to have an independent judiciary, judges who can make decisions independent of the political winds that are blowing.": "Caroline",
  "I always showed myself in the face of day, asserting the liberty and independence of my country, while some others, like owls, courted concealment and were too much afraid of losing their roosts to leave them for such a cause.": "William",
  "I know of no country in which there is so little independence of mind and real freedom of discussion as in America.": "Alexis",
  "The Declaration of Independence I always considered as a theatrical show. Jefferson ran away with all the stage effect of that... and all the glory of it.": "John",
  "In the progress of personality, first comes a declaration of independence, then a recognition of interdependence.": "Henry",
  "Come November, the American people will have the chance to re-declare their independence. Americans will have a chance to vote for trade, immigration and foreign policies that put our citizens first. They will have the chance to reject today's rule by the global elite, and to embrace real change that delivers a government of, by and for the people.": "Donald",
  "The new electronic independence re-creates the world in the image of a global village.": "Marshall",
  "If there is one thing I fear less than everything else, it is, I believe, persecution for my opinions. There are a good many points about which I may be diffident, but when it comes to questions of Truth and intellectual independence, there is no holding me - I can envisage no finer end than to sacrifice oneself for a conviction.": "Pierre",
  "Out of my desire to complete Iraq's independence and to finish the withdrawal of the occupation forces from our holy lands, I am obliged to halt military operations of the honest Iraqi resistance until the withdrawal of the occupation forces is complete.": "Muqtada",
  "It is easy to be independent when you've got money. But to be independent when you haven't got a thing, that's the Lord's test.": "Mahalia",
  "True freedom is the capacity for acting according to one's true character, to be altogether one's self, to be self-determined and not subject to outside coercion.": "Corliss",
  "The Declaration of Independence, the United States Constitution, the constitutions of the several states, and the organic laws of the territories all alike propose to protect the people in the exercise of their God-given rights. Not one of them pretends to bestow rights.": "Susan",
  "I should like to know if, taking this old Declaration of Independence, which declares that all men are equal upon principle, you begin making exceptions to it, where will you stop? If one man says it does not mean a Negro, why not another say it does not mean some other man?": "Abraham",
  "I became an actor in that important drama with an inflexible resolution to persevere through the last scene, when we might be permitted and acknowledged to enjoy what we had so nobly declared we would possess, or lose with our lives - Freedom and Independence!": "Deborah",
  "The spirit of Ubuntu, that once led Haiti to emerge as the first independent black nation in 1804, helped Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador attain liberty, and inspired our forefathers to shed their blood for the United States' independence, cannot die. Today, this spirit of solidarity must and will empower all of us to rebuild Haiti.": "Jean-Bertrand",
  "Education in India has made monumental progress since Independence but continues to face daunting challenges at multiple levels, particularly in terms of quality, infrastructure and dropout rates. We have islands of excellence floating in a sea of mediocrity.": "Shashi",
  "What is it that makes us trust our judges? Their independence in office and manner of appointment.": "John",
  "Our Declaration of Independence was held sacred by all and thought to include all; but now, to aid in making the bondage of the Negro universal and eternal, it is assailed, sneered at, construed, hawked at, and torn, till, if its framers could rise from their graves, they could not at all recognize it.": "Abraham",
  "Bread without flesh is a good diet, as on many botanical excursions I have proved. Tea also may easily be ignored. Just bread and water and delightful toil is all I need - not unreasonably much, yet one ought to be trained and tempered to enjoy life in these brave wilds in full independence of any particular kind of nourishment.": "John",
  "The government, under my leadership, will act to implement the rule of law and to maintain the independence of the judicial system, which is one of the pillars of maintaining a democratic system.": "Ariel",

  "Throughout the day no time for memorandums now. Go ahead! Liberty and independence forever.": "Davy",
  "I have an interesting perspective on depending on others. I think it gives people a chance to serve. And I'm not so much big on independence, as I am on interdependence. I'm not talking about co-dependency, I'm talking about giving people the opportunity to practicing love with its sleeves rolled up.": "Joni",
  "It is hard to conceive of the utter demoralization, of the political blindness and immorality, of the patriotic dishonesty, of the cruelty and degradation of a people who supplemented the incomparable Declaration of Independence with the Fugitive Slave Law.": "Robert",
  "The principle that a central bank, charged with controlling inflation, should be independent from the government is unassailable. It may also be true that it's easier for the central bank to guard its independence from political pressure when it mainly holds government securities.": "Janet",
  "Here was buried Thomas Jefferson Author of the Declaration of American Independence Of the Statute of Virginia for religious freedom & Father of the University of Virginia.": "Thomas",
  "It is very nearly impossible... to become an educated person in a country so distrustful of the independent mind.": "James",
  "Part of your heritage in this society is the opportunity to become financially independent.": "Jim",
  "It matters enormously to a successful democratic society like ours that we have three branches of government, each with some independence and some control over the other two. That's set out in the Constitution.": "Sandra",
  "There is an inverse relationship between reliance on the state and self-reliance.": "William",
  "I guess you'd call me an independent, since I've never identified myself with one party or another in politics. I always decide my vote by taking as careful a look as I can at the actual candidates and issues themselves, no matter what the party label.": "Jackie",
  "One single vision fills all minds: that of our independence endangered. One single duty imposes itself upon our wills: the duty of stubborn resistance.": "Albert",

  "Divorce is a declaration of independence with only two signers.": "Gerald",
  "If we are serious about moving toward energy independence in a cost-effective way, we should invest in solar energy. If we are serious about cutting air and water pollution and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, we should invest in solar energy.": "Bernie",
  "Simply by starting to cook again, you declare your independence from the culture of fast food. As soon as you cook, you start thinking about ingredients. You start thinking about plants and animals and not the microwave. And you will find that your diet, just by that one simple act, that is greatly improved.": "Michael",

  "In a world of status, independence is key, because a primary means of establishing status is to tell others what to do, and taking orders is a marker of low status.

  "The good man is he who rules himself as he does his own property: his autonomous being is modelled on material power.": "Theodor",

  "I think my independence was a big help to getting Judges Roberts and Alito confirmed, and I think that's recognized.": "Arlen",
  "The American War of Independence is the expulsion of the intrusive elements, alien to the American essence. If American reality is the reinvention of itself, whatever is found in any way irreducible or unassimilable is not American.": "Octavio",
  "The way I was grew up gave me a slight fearlessness and a sense of independence. There are things about it that have definitely informed me. And then, as a parent, it's done the opposite. It's made me feel much more protective. There are boundaries in my kids' lives that I don't think I had.": "Sam",
  "I think that initial independence is very important that's what being an entrepreneur is all about.": "Jon",
  "This game wears on you. It tears you down. It's perpetual motion for some people who've achieved a level of independence, like Madonna and Jay-Z - they don't need to do music anymore. But there's people who need it. And in that need, that's when it's tough and it tears you to pieces.": "Lupe",
  "I'm for absolute autonomy of the individual, and an adult, competent woman has absolute autonomy. It's her choice.": "Jack",

  "'Chocolat' was a sort of statement of my own childhood, recognizing I experienced something from the end of the colonial era and the beginning of independence as I was a child that really made me aware of things I never forgot - a sort of childhood that made me different when I was a student in France.": "Claire",
  "Women are living independently, but we don't yet have the social and economic policies behind us to support that independence.": "Rebecca",

  "The one thing that the President can do is to establish a real energy independence plan. We have all the recources we need right here in this country to establish energy independence if we had the leadership.": "Herman",
  "If the world market believed that we were serious about energy independence and we were going to utilize all of our own existing resources, the speculators would stop speculating up they start speculating down as we get our own oil out of the ground.": "Herman",
  "I would have to have people totally committed to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of this United States.

  "Without U.S. independence, North America would have remained a rural, non-industrial breadbasket. Blessed as it was with natural resources, agrarian North America would have supplied cotton and beef and lumber to industrial Britain. America would thus be more like Australia - a nice enough place to live, but no kind of world power.": "Stephen",

  "President after president has said energy independence is critical. But then you have the EPA tasked to go after American companies producing coal and penalizing them. You can't have it both ways.": "Corey",

  "Who would think it possible to redirect historical scholarship by explaining what Thomas Jefferson said in the Declaration of Independence?": "Edmund",

  "As a boy, the very words 'Liberty Bell' and 'Independence Hall' fired my imagination and made a profound and lasting impression on my mind.

  "In the modern era, Jewish sovereignty over the land of our ancestors is a relatively short phenomenon.

Combined with Israel's independence in 1948, this is about 160 years of effective sovereignty.": "Edgar",

  "Like all of Latin America, Mexico after independence in 1821 turned its back on a triple heritage: on the Spanish heritage, because we were newly liberated colonies, and on our Indian and black heritages, because we considered them backward and barbaric. We looked towards France, England and the U.S., to become progressive democratic republics.": "Carlos",
  "Our independence from AOL was so important to me that I negotiated an extremely odd provision in our purchase agreement that allowed me to disclose confidential information about AOL. It was their job never to give me that information. It was not my job to protect it in any way.": "Michael",

  "I do need my independence. I have to have that.": "Carol",

  "I will say that anyone who supports Scottish independence should go to Athens. Because nothing works. It is a disaster. It is a ruined, dirty place where people do not have money or future prospects. The day one after independence, Scotland would be worse.": "Philip",

  "I'm for economic independence.": "Charles",
  "The director of 'Independence Day,' 'Godzilla' and 'The Patriot' has certain attributes, all of which are given full vent in 'The Day After Tomorrow.'

  "In America we tell our parents to bring their child home and put him or her in a crib; as they get older, children sleep in they own room not in Mom and Dad's room. What are we training them for? It's independence, because that's what being empowered is all about.": "Sheena",

  "It helps immerse yourself in what you potentially want to do. Being involved, learning firsthand and observing the craft and absorbing all you can, makes it easier to define what you want.

  "The love of learning, the sequestered nooks, And all the sweet serenity of books.": "Henry",

  "Public education must be viewed from the lens of providing each child with the learning environment that best meets his or her needs.

  "It's mainly about working hard and proving to people you're serious about it, and stretching yourself and learning. The mistake a lot of actors make, particularly young ones, is allowing themselves to feel that they're the finished articles, the bee's knees, and it's not true.": "Daniel",
  "I always say the minute I stop making mistakes is the minute I stop learning and I've definitely learned a lot.": "Miley",

  "Without question, students need to practice, review, and drill skills, but they should do so only in the spirit of working toward more complex mastery of those skills. Redundant drill of skills is inherently boring and insulting to the learner, and it is one of the most effective methods for turning students off to learning.": "Heidi",
  "Writing in a journal reminds you of your goals and of your learning in life. It offers a place where you can hold a deliberate, thoughtful conversation with yourself.": "Robin",
  "I was a very good student. Procrastinating gives me anxiety, and getting a B really ticked me off. Sure, I didn't always want to do my homework, but I actually really liked school. As nerdy as it sounds, I love learning.": "Josie",
  "I used to have all these plans and think 'Ah, I have my whole life figured out', but then I realized no matter how much I plan: life happens! So I find myself living day to day trying to do my best, embracing every moment as a learning opportunity and chance to get to know myself a little more.": "Q'orianka",
  "The computer is my favourite invention. I feel lucky to be part of the global village. I don't mean to brag, but I'm so fast with technology. People think it all seems too much, but we'll get used to it. I'm sure it all seemed too much when we were learning to walk.": "Yoko",
  "I love being challenged and defending my positions and, when I'm wrong, learning from the exchange. It makes me smarter and better as a businessperson.": "Mark",
  "What we face may look insurmountable. But I learned something from all those years of training and competing. I learned something from all those sets and reps when I didn't think I could lift another ounce of weight. What I learned is that we are always stronger than we know.": "Arnold",
  "I enjoyed the whole process of learning and was always happy when autumn came and school or college started up again.": "Claire",

  "The French word for wanderlust or wandering is 'errance.' The etymology is the same as 'error.' So to wander is to make mistakes. In other words, to make mistakes, to make errors is sort of the idea of learning through trial and error, allowing the mistakes to be part of the process.": "Robyn",
  "There are no mistakes. The events we bring upon ourselves, no matter how unpleasant, are necessary in order to learn what we need to learn; whatever steps we take, they're necessary to reach the places we've chosen to go.": "Richard",

  "As I enter a new phase of life and my circle broadens, I start learning new things.": "Kapil",

  "That's the beauty of the acting world. You can play so many different characters who know and do so many things that you have no idea about as yourself. So I'm a big fan of workshops and classes and learning new things because you can always apply it. It's your little supply bag of creativity. Keep filling it up.": "Daniela",
  "Before and after emancipation, the Negro, in self-defense, was propelled toward the white employer.

That's when one of my teachers discovered I had a learning disability called dyslexia. Once I got help, I read very well!": "Patricia",
  "Fear is present when we forget that we are a part of God's divine design.

  "Anyone who's made film and knows about the cinema has a lifelong love affair with the experience. You never stop learning about film.": "Francis",

  "I think my biggest learning experience is that it's okay to be who you are - you don't have to exactly fit the mold of what people think a certain kind of career is. I think that discovery - of really knowing who I am and being okay with that and loving myself - was amazing.": "Dree",

  "I'm learning to be braver with colorful clothes, even if they're a little wild.": "Yuliya",
  "For children, diversity needs to be real and not merely relegated to learning the names of the usual suspects during Black History Month or enjoying south-of-the-border cuisine on Cinco de Mayo.

  "If you feel your school is failing you, the question is why. Is it a lack of parental involvement, large classes, school violence, poor learning environment?

  "The objectification of females is not a good thing! Not every rapper does this, but when the lyrics focus solely on the strip club, 'poppin' bottles' and how many girls they can 'tap,' it distorts what kids are learning.

  "Going to a party, for me, is as much a learning experience as, you know, sitting in a lecture.": "Natalie",
  "I'm getting to a point where everything is becoming streamlined in my life. I'm learning how to stand onstage for two hours and play in front of thousands of people as if I am completely in the moment every moment.": "John",
  "I'm forever learning and that's why I'm always able to create new styles and new dimensions of hip-hop.": "Doug",

  "Philosophy is a kind of journey, ever learning yet never arriving at the ideal perfection of truth.": "Albert",
  "For a small child there is no division between playing and learning between the things he or she does just for fun and things that are educational. The child learns while living and any part of living that is enjoyable is also play.": "Penelope",
  "There's always a learning curve, where you've got to learn what your subject is all about.": "Brad",
  "Anytime you ride against the best in the world, it becomes a learning process.": "Bonnie",
  "There's no media training. In cooking school, there's not even manager training. You learn the fundamentals of cooking. Everything else is learning by doing.": "Rene",
  "Learning something new is fun.": "Alex",
  "I'm learning a lot about the culture of weight loss. I didn't know there were bloggers out there who were proud to be fat.": "Mick",
  "But I think it's hard for me to only put out one record a year. Because I get too antsy. But it's good I'm learning to do that, because each record counts. And you should make it count.": "Ty",
  "There is incredible potential for digital technology in and beyond the classroom, but it is vital to rethink how learning is organised if we are to reap the rewards.": "Geoff",
  "Dad wouldn't let me fool with his guitar much, because I'm left-handed, and I'd pick it up upside down. But I remember learning to sing 'Paper Doll,' the Mills Brothers song - this was during the war - and I remember my dad taking me down to one of those little record booths where you could make spoken letters to send home.": "Don",
  "The earliest memories I have of the ocean are actually stories - stories from my grandfather, the legendary ocean explorer and conservationist Jacques Cousteau. My passion for ocean conservation stems from learning at a very young age that we're all connected; we're all in this together.": "Philippe",
  "Learning from the experiences of our ancestors, let us together create knowledge for all that benefits all.": "Kailash",
  "Parents can only do what they think is best, with the experience they have. The learning curve for every parent is that there's a limit to how much they can shield children from.": "Matt",
  "Playing in my early bands, working as a studio musician, producing and going to art school was, in retrospect, my apprenticeship. I was learning and creating a solid foundation of ideas, but I wasn't really playing music.": "Jimmy",
  "You could imagine a language exactly like English except it doesn't have connectives like 'and' that allow you to make longer expressions. An infant learning truncated English would have no idea about this: They would just pick it up as they would standard English.": "Noam",
  "Most artists, you know, you spend their entire lives learning how to play music and write songs, and they don't really know how the music business works.": "Moby",
  "It's only through listening that you learn, and I never want to stop learning.": "Drew",
  "Learning how to edit movies was a real breakthrough.": "Peter",
  "We come to love not by finding a perfect person but by learning to see an imperfect person perfectly.": "Sam",
  "There has to be innate circuitry that does the learning, that creates the culture, that acquires the culture, and that responds to socialization.": "Steven",
  "Learning how to keep track of inventory and cash flow and creating an income statement and a balance sheet are great skills to learn for managing existing businesses.": "Steve",
  "The thing about being autistic is that you gradually get less and less autistic, because you keep learning, you keep learning how to behave. It's like being in a play; I'm always in a play.": "Temple",
  "It is only from the people I've had the good fortune to meet that I am learning the lessons to guide me. Baz Luhrmann, director of 'Moulin Rouge,' for example, has a childlike curiosity about the world. He doesn't pretend to know all the answers - quite the opposite, in fact. He asks loads of questions of everyone.": "Simon",
  "The unsuccessful person is burdened by learning, and prefers to walk down familiar paths. Their distaste for learning stunts their growth and limits their influence.": "John",
  "The most useful piece of learning for the uses of life is to unlearn what is untrue.": "Antisthenes",
  "And, one thing I definitely enjoyed personally, from a selfish point of view, was exploration and going to places that I had never been to before and learning, you know, meeting the people and getting to know, new sights and sounds, etc.": "Duane",
  "I worry that when educational counselors and teachers call in families with concerns about a child having a learning disability, we aren't always looking at the complete picture.": "Madchen",
  "If I've learned anything through all of this, it's that each and every day is a canvas waiting to be painted - an opportunity for love, for fun, for living, for learning.": "Craig",
  "A lot of the problems I had with fame I was bringing on myself. A lot of self-loathing, a lot of woe-is-me. Now I'm learning to see the positive side of things, instead of, like, 'I can't go to Kmart. I can't take my kids to the haunted house.'": "Eminem",
  "I'm less worried about accomplishment - as younger people always can't help but be - and more concerned with spending my time well, spending time with my family, and reading, learning things.": "Jonathan",
  "A camera is a tool for learning how to see without a camera.": "Dorothea",
  "I'm not saying that putting on makeup will change the world or even your life, but it can be a first step in learning things about yourself you may never have discovered otherwise. At worst, you could make a big mess and have a good laugh.": "Kevyn",
  "The way my brain processes information is quite odd. I mean, I have Attention Deficit Disorder and another learning disability I can't even spell. I don't even have a high school diploma. I'm smart, but you can't prove it on paper.": "Ron",
  "The only real progress lies in learning to be wrong all alone.": "Albert",
  "It is of practical value to learn to like yourself. Since you must spend so much time with yourself you might as well get some satisfaction out of the relationship.": "Norman",
  "In times of change learners inherit the earth while the learned find themselves beautifully equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists.": "Eric",
  "A weed is a plant that has mastered every survival skill except for learning how to grow in rows.": "Doug",
  "I should only look back at moments that were disparaging, look down upon, negative for me - moments where I could learn something. And if I have been able to use that learning in future, then I am happy about it.": "Amitabh",
  "I'm always interested in learning something new.": "Katherine",
  "As an entrepreneur, you never stop learning.": "Daymond",
  "The person you consider ignorant and insignificant is the one who came from God, that he might learn bliss from grief and knowledge from gloom.": "Khalil",

  "He will therefore have to use what knowledge he can achieve, not to shape the results as the craftsman shapes his handiwork, but rather to cultivate a growth by providing the appropriate environment, in the manner in which the gardener does this for his plants.": "Friedrich",
  "It's hard to imagine anything more interesting than learning how we're woven into the enormous tapestry of existence. Where did our universe come from? How special is our world, and how special are we? We allocate tens of billions of dollars annually to NASA, NSF and academia in search of the answers.": "Seth",
  "Cross-cultural learning and studying abroad can be transformative.": "Amal",
  "I was diagnosed with a severe temporal spatial deficit, a learning disability that means I have zero spatial relations skills. It was official: I was a genius trapped in an idiot's body.": "Sloane",
  "You made a lot of mistakes, and you wrote a lot of crap. But it was all part of the learning process.": "Cynthia",
  "Doing a documentary is about discovering, being open, learning, and following curiosity.": "Spike",
  "The truth is that we can learn to condition our minds, bodies, and emotions to link pain or pleasure to whatever we choose. By changing what we link pain and pleasure to, we will instantly change our behaviors.": "Tony",
  "By playing games you can artificially speed up your learning curve to develop the right kind of thought processes.": "Nate",
  "Learning is its own exceeding great reward.": "William",
  "I don't need to see the old school to remember it and the teachers there. They changed the way that I've always looked at life and learning.": "Dennis",
  "If anybody wanted to photograph my life, they'd get bored in a day. 'Heres Matt at home learning his lines. Here's Matt researching in aisle six of his local library'. A few hours of that and they'd go home.": "Matt",
  "It definitely has learning a lesson about the way you're living your life. I wouldn't compare our movie to that, but it has a structure where it's about a man who doesn't appreciate all that he has and finds out at the end that life has been great and he has to enjoy that.": "Adam",
  "If I am through learning, I am through.": "John",
  "Sometimes I get extremely disturbed with the things that are written. But you can't do anything about it. As a celebrity, you are putting yourself out there to be judged, and that's fine. I am now learning not to get affected by such things. I am building my career and making choices that I think are right while minding my own business.": "Anushka",
  "Learning is the gateway to adventure.": "Princess",
  "I think this industry can be tough on everyone. You have to surround yourself with supportive people and know when to put your foot down and do what's best for you and your family. The first few years in the music industry can be a steep learning curve, and I've definitely developed a thicker skin!": "Rebecca",
  "A single conversation across the table with a wise man is better than ten years mere study of books.": "Henry",
  "We should regret our mistakes and learn from them, but never carry them forward into the future with us.": "Lucy",
  "For me, learning is a continuous process and an all-inclusive one - reading a book, learning a musical instrument or learning the martial art called taekwondo. Teach myself something new - that's my prayer.": "Sonu",
  "With every book, you go back to school. You become a student. You become an investigative reporter. You spend a little time learning what it's like to live in someone else's shoes.": "John",
  "Life isn't about algebra and geometry. Learning by making mistakes and not duplicating them is what life is about.": "Lindsay",
  "I think I started learning lessons about being a good person long before I ever knew what basketball was. And that starts in the home, it starts with the parental influence.": "Julius",
  "There's nothing like being a soldier for confidence or learning your limits or enduring utter humiliation.": "Guy",
  "I don't think human beings learn anything without desperation. Desperation is a necessary ingredient to learning anything or creating anything. Period. If you ain't desperate at some point, you ain't interesting.": "Jim",
  "Entire ignorance is not so terrible or extreme an evil, and is far from being the greatest of all; too much cleverness and too much learning, accompanied with ill bringing-up, are far more fatal.": "Plato",
  "We often assume that all teachers within a discipline address the same curriculum. This isn't always the case. We frequently find gaps between goals and what is actually taught, and these gaps can have a lasting impact on a child's learning.": "Heidi",
  "We learn differently as children than as adults. For grown-ups, learning a new skill is painful, attention-demanding, and slow. Children learn unconsciously and effortlessly.": "Alison",
  "Learning to fly an airplane taught me a way of thinking, an approach to problem-solving that was applicable and effective. Pilots are very methodical and meticulous, and artists tend not to be.": "Chris",
  "Behavior is mutable. It changes from place to place. It's like accents, dialect - it varies from one area to another. But there are universal truths about what it means to be a human being. All the other stuff is like applique. Learning that was interesting to me and probably useful for becoming an actor.": "Julianne",
  "Education in our times must try to find whatever there is in students that might yearn for completion, and to reconstruct the learning that would enable them autonomously to seek that completion.": "Allan",
  "There's no mystery to it. Nothing more complicated than learning lines and putting on a costume.": "Morgan",
  "The learning process continues until the day you die.": "Kirk",
  "I worry sometimes that I'm a bit moralistic; always writing about men who are learning to grow up, not be so self-absorbed, selfish or badly behaved. I wonder if that's dull and liberal and wimpy? I should probably write something that celebrates wickedness.": "David",
  "My daddy wanted me to be a farmer; feel the smoothness of Alabama clay and become one of the first blacks in my town to own land. But, I was worried about my history being caked with that southern clay, and I subscribed to a different kind of teaching and learning in my bones and in my spirit.": "John",
  "Negative feelings are typical of learning, and you shouldn't feel like you're stupid when you're frustrated doing something. You might say to yourself, 'I can't do this,' but you should say, 'That's great.' That means you really have the potential to learn something there.": "Angela",
  "I'm constantly learning, and that is the greatest gift of life in my opinion - to always be learning and growing.": "Kristin",
  "So many people have touched my heart and made an impact on my world. I'm thankful for every lesson and learning experience.": "Bindi",
  "Kids don't need to be taught the value of making; they are natural makers, at least until traditional education makes them afraid of making mistakes. The long-term value of making for kids is in learning to become an active participant in the world around them rather than a consumer of prepackaged products and solutions.": "Mark",
  "Seeing is no longer believing. The very notion of truth has been put into crisis. In a world bloated with images, we are finally learning that photographs do indeed lie.": "Barbara",
  "'Cars' was about Lightning McQueen learning to slow down and to enjoy life. The journey is the reward.": "John",
  "I feel like I've lived a life of making mistakes and learning from them and doing my best to only make each mistake once.": "Bre",
  "If we want to recruit and retain high-quality teachers, it starts with a fair wage, adequate working conditions, and the resources and support to succeed. Remember: teachers' working conditions are students' learning conditions.": "Randi",
  "When I was learning to creep, my mother set me down on the beach to see what I thought of it. I crawled straight for the coming wave and was just through the wall of green when she caught my heels.": "Sylvia",
  "I never learned from a man who agreed with me.": "Robert",
  "Have you learned the lessons only of those who admired you, and were tender with you, and stood aside for you? Have you not learned great lessons from those who braced themselves against you, and disputed passage with you?": "Walt",
  "I loved making Pure Country. It was a great learning experience for me, seeing another part of the entertainment industry.": "George",
  "Learning by doing, peer-to-peer teaching, and computer simulation are all part of the same equation.": "Nicholas",
  "Learning to celebrate success is a key component of learning how to win in the market.": "Douglas",
  "I think I will always be performing I don't think I can take that away. Because I really just enjoy it. I like getting up to sing I like the challenge of learning new material and singing it in front of an audience.": "Lea",
  "The main part of intellectual education is not the acquisition of facts, but learning how to make facts live.": "Oliver",
  "Since we can't know what knowledge will be most needed in the future, it is senseless to try to teach it in advance. Instead, we should try to turn out people who love learning so much and learn so well that they will be able to learn whatever needs to be learned.": "John",
  "We learn more by looking for the answer to a question and not finding it than we do from learning the answer itself.": "Lloyd",
  "Jazz is the big brother of the blues. If a guy's playing blues like we play, he's in high school. When he starts playing jazz it's like going on to college, to a school of higher learning.": "B.",
  "Learning is any change in a system that produces a more or less permanent change in its capacity for adapting to its environment.": "Herbert",
  "The best part of making the movies... learning from the pros themselves.": "Michelle",
  "During the days of segregation, there was not a place of higher learning for African Americans. They were simply not welcome in many of the traditional schools. And from this backward policy grew the network of historical black colleges and universities.": "Michael",
  "Productivity is going to be a critical issue. And it's not just about getting more time for professors in the classroom. It involves reexamining the learning experience and restructuring faculty and the use of faculty time.": "Roy",
  "There is not to be found, in all history, any miracle attested by a sufficient number of men, of such unquestioned good sense, education and learning, as to secure us against all delusion in themselves.": "David",
  "Just because you are CEO, don't think you have landed. You must continually increase your learning, the way you think, and the way you approach the organization. I've never forgotten that.": "Indra",
  "The willingness to keep learning is, I think, the most important thing about trying to be good at anything. You never want to stop learning.": "Emile",
  "Before, it was just about making the films - and now it's releasing them. Which is a steep learning curve.": "Jessica",
  "A commitment to human rights cannot be fostered simply through the transmission of knowledge. Action and experience play a crucial role in the learning process.": "Daisaku",
  "Acting has always existed alongside my normal life. It's been a case of learning on the job. I've worked in so many styles, with so many people, so I've picked bits up from everyone and everything.": "Felicity",
  "Learning is a tunnel experience that makes us think more broadly.": "Anna",
  "Everything is a learning experience.": "Angus",
  "Learning to see waste and systematically eliminate it has allowed lean companies such as Toyota to dominate entire industries. Lean thinking defines value as 'providing benefit to the customer' anything else is waste.": "Eric",
  "I'm open for possibilities. I'm open for choices. I always welcome new ideas. I'm always eager to learn. I'm never going to close my mind from learning.": "Cesar",
  "When you come from a big family, you see that, growing up, you're learning how to share. Your sisters have got your back; you're not alone in this - 'We all support you!' Your family provides that; it gives you a sense of safety, and it's a very grounding feeling.": "Gisele",
  "A lot of people think I had such a rosy career, but I wanted to identify that one of the things that helps you have a long career is learning how to deal with adversity, how to get past it. Once I learned how to get through that, others things didn't seem so hard.": "Cal",
  "Mastering music is more than learning technical skills. Practicing is about quality, not quantity. Some days I practice for hours; other days it will be just a few minutes.": "Yo-Yo",
  "When you win a lot, you don't learn much. With my ups and downs, it's a lot of learning.": "Tina",
  "I know how to set an irrigation tube, and I helped with the harvest. I learned the law of the harvest without even knowing I was learning it. On the farm, you learn early that you reap what you sow.": "Sheri",
  "Every relationship you have, you're learning and growing and taking something from that.": "Blake",
  "It always seems to me so odd that when a man dies, he takes out with him all the knowledge that he has got in his lifetime whilst sowing his wild oats or winning successes. And he leaves his sons or younger brothers to go through all the work of learning it over again from their own experience.": "Robert",
  "Arab civilizations had been of an abstract nature, moral and intellectual rather than applied; and their lack of public spirit made their excellent private qualities futile. They were fortunate in their epoch: Europe had fallen barbarous; and the memory of Greek and Latin learning was fading from men's minds.": "T.",
  "I'm learning that you can be comfortable and still look beautiful.": "Selena",
  "No good actor ever stops learning. He is constantly evolving.": "Mahesh",
  "Learning the core curriculum cannot come through coercion. It must come through a recognition of the need to integrate with economic life.": "Reuven",
  "I started once a week in North Carolina at a pub called Charlie Goodnight and met a lot of comics there. Then I moved to L.A., and if you're not known, it's hard to get stage time. So you start out doing what they call 'bringers' - you have to bring five people if you wanna get on stage. It was a lot of hustle, a learning curve.": "Retta",
  "School systems now routinely have more administrators than classroom teachers. They have armies of counselors and therapists and nutritionists and 'multi-cultural learning facilitators.'": "Mike",
  "I know I'm likeable, but living with me is different. Yes, I can be charming. That desire to please people and learning what to do to charm their socks off is something many of us do. But you get into a relationship, and the party's over at some point. They see the real you.": "John",
  "I never was good at learning things. I did just enough work to pass. In my opinion it would have been wrong to do more than was just sufficient, so I worked as little as possible.": "Manfred",
  "Taking charge of your own learning is a part of taking charge of your life, which is the sine qua non in becoming an integrated person.": "Warren",
  "One of the things we did at PayPal was collaborative filtering and machine learning: looking at patterns of human behavior. We used it there to predict when people would try to cheat the system to get money. But you can predict pretty much any behavior with a certain amount of accuracy.": "Max",
  "If we want boys to succeed, we need to bring them back to education by making education relevant to them and bring in more service learning and vocational education.": "Michael",
  "Every act of conscious learning requires the willingness to suffer an injury to one's self-esteem. That is why young children, before they are aware of their own self-importance, learn so easily.": "Thomas",
  "I've been doing a lot of learning from mistakes, first and foremost, and building off that.": "William",
  "Patriotism, when it wants to make itself felt in the domain of learning, is a dirty fellow who should be thrown out of doors.": "Arthur",
  "I have heard endlessly that fish are so resilient that there is no way that you could exterminate a species. We are learning otherwise.": "Sylvia",
  "It is a mistake to separate learning for work and for community and personal development.": "David",
  "When I was 12 years old, I got interested in learning English.": "Jack",
  "New ideas for innovation grow out of the minds of each new generation. Having an institution of higher learning that can help young people put those ideas into action is critical.": "Jay",
  "It is what we know already that often prevents us from learning.": "Claude",
  "I grow old learning something new every day.": "Solon",
  "Each time you go to the grocery store with your kids, it is a potential learning opportunity. In order not to overemphasize materialism, focus on other things to do with money. In 'Beyond the Lemonade Stand,' I try to emphasize the importance of saving money, and of using it to help other people.": "Bill",
  "One who has imagination without learning has wings without feet.": "Joseph",
  "Whoso neglects learning in his youth, loses the past and is dead for the future.": "Euripides",
  "It goes against the grain of modern education to teach students to program. What fun is there to making plans, acquiring discipline, organizing thoughts, devoting attention to detail, and learning to be self critical.": "Alan",
  "Making a wrong decision is understandable. Refusing to search continually for learning is not.": "Phil",
  "The trick in life is learning how to deal with it.": "Helen",
  "I wanted to translate from one flat surface to another. In fact, my learning disabilities controlled a lot of things. I don't recognize faces, so I'm sure it's what drove me to portraits in the first place.": "Chuck",
  "Coming to understand a painting or a symphony in an unfamiliar style, to recognize the work of an artist or school, to see or hear in new ways, is as cognitive an achievement as learning to read or write or add.": "Nelson",
  "It does not require great learning to be a Christian and be convinced of the truth of the Bible. It requires only an honest heart and a willingness to obey God.": "Albert",
  "Perfecting oneself is as much unlearning as it is learning.": "Edsger",
  "People desire to separate their worlds into polarities of dark and light, ugly and beautiful, good and evil, right and wrong, inside and outside. Polarities serve us in our learning and growth, but as souls we are all.": "Joy",
  "I wouldn't change anything. I think that it's important to let things happen, and stay 'happened'. I think that's all part of the learning curve, part of fate. I'm just glad that it happened.": "Mike",
  "The Seinfeld motto: No learning, no hugging.": "Julia",
  "I had a lot of trouble with engineers, because their whole background is learning from a functional point of view, and then learning how to perform that function.": "Brian",

  "You should be having more fun in high school, exploring things because you want to explore them and learning because you love learning-not worrying about competition.": "Maya",
  "Cops and robbers resemble each other, so there's not a lot to learn in terms of learning the logistics of committing the crime or investigating the crime.": "Andre",

  "Composing gives me a chance to work in multiple dimensions and helps me pare down my melodies into what is essential. Learning new skills has always energized me and scoring has opened up a world of sonic possibilities.": "Liz",
  "I'm interested in all forms of performance, yet I think it's difficult to be as equally talented in all of them as they call for such different skills. At the moment, I still feel I'm learning and want as much experience and variety as possible.": "Felicity",
  "For me, French is so rich and so sacred that learning it is like learning a foreign language.": "Fabrice",
  "My message going forward is that I want to remind everyone in the aviation industry - especially those who manage aviation companies and those who regulate aviation - that we owe it to our passengers to keep learning how to do it better.": "Chesley",
  "The thing about music is it's not an obscure pursuit, it's a very natural thing for human beings to do. Once you put in the effort, the learning curve is very fast.": "Grimes",
  "That's the whole spiritual life. It's learning how to die. And as you learn how to die, you start losing all your illusions, and you start being capable now of true intimacy and love.": "Eugene",
  "One of the bigger misconceptions of learning is that many skills take a lifetime to get world-class at, or 10,000 hours to become world-class at.": "Timothy",
  "When I left the U.S. for the first time, I spent my first year abroad in Japan. That culture shock and abundance of new stimuli combined with a lack of guidance forced me to develop my own approaches to learning and juggling.": "Timothy",
  "Concepts like edX and online learning will transform education. This will completely change the world. I believe that people will move to online learning, both on campuses and worldwide. We have a real opportunity to be able to bring people around the world into our fold.": "Anant",
  "I'm learning simplicity and how to wear my body. I'm enjoying life and trying to be the best me.": "Gelila",
  "When counting on learning from innovation, there are great successes but also failures. The Wright Brothers invented the aircraft and started an amazing process of innovation, where we now have planes that carry 500 passengers. Along the way there were some silly looking vehicles that crashed early on.": "Sheldon",
  "One of the main focuses of my training sessions is to help individuals find their unique voices in the learning process. We all have our strengths, our weaknesses, our styles of learning, our personalities. Developing introspective sensitivity to these issues is critical to long-term success.": "Joshua",
  "I don't think there is anything wrong with learning from people who are better than you.": "Asa",
  "Training a dog, to me, is on a par with learning to dance with my wife or teaching my son to ski. These are fun things we do together. If anyone even talks about dominating the dog or hurting him or fighting him or punishing him, don't go there.": "Ian",
  "I'm learning kite surfing. It's a little surfboard you have on your feet with straps, and you have a big kite like a power glider in the air that pulls you. You don't need waves to move, and it makes a big spray of water as you go.": "Bertrand",
  "The luster of an experience can actually go up with time. So, learning to play a new instrument, learning a new language - those sorts of things will pay dividends for years or decades to come.": "Dan",
  "In most schools, we measure children on what they know. By and large, they have to memorize the content of whatever test is coming up. Because measuring the results of rote learning is easy, rote prevails. What kids know is just not important in comparison with whether they can think.": "Sugata",
  "As we decipher our biology and learn to modify and adjust it, we are learning to modify ourselves - and we will do so. No laws will stop this.": "Gregory",
  "The extreme sophistication of modern technology - wonderful though its benefits are - is, ironically, an impediment to engaging young people with basics: with learning how things work.": "Martin",
  "Early in my songwriting career, when I was learning a lot about writing songs, I'd force myself to sit down until I came up with something.": "Luke",
  "Growing up, yeah, I had a magic kit with learn tricks and learn card tricks, but I was never... I used to watch whatever magic special was on as a kid, but then, it's not that I lost interest, but to be a magician, you really, it's really hard work. Learning lines is hard enough; learning sleight of hand, that's real practice.": "Steve",
  "I always enjoyed school, and I enjoyed being focused on learning - and I know that sounds nerdy, but there were so many wonderful elements of going to school with just girls. I wouldn't brush my hair.": "Stacey",
  "Neurologically, I'm a quadriplegic, so virtually everything about my work has been driven by my learning disabilities, which are quite severe, and my lack of facial recognition, which I'm sure is what drove me to paint portraits in the first place.": "Chuck",

  "We need to have an educational system that's able to embrace all sorts of minds, and where a student doesn't have to fit into a certain mold of learning.": "James",
  "There is the desire of a consumer society to have no learning curves. This tends to result in very dumbed-down products that are easy to get started on, but are generally worthless and/or debilitating.": "Alan",
  "Young children seem to be learning who to share this toy with and figure out how it works, while adolescents seem to be exploring some very deep and profound questions: 'How should this society work? How should relationships among people work?' The exploration is: 'Who am I, what am I doing?'": "Alison",
  "I would love to take a cooking class from Gandhi. Maybe I could teach him how to cook, and he could teach me his message. I wouldn't mind learning how to make couscous from scratch from a North African woman, either.": "Marcus",
  "I believe human beings mark a threshold in the development of the planet, of course, but it is only part of the picture. What Big History can do is show us the nature of our complexity and fragility and the dangers that face us, but it can also show us our power, with collective learning.": "David",
  "There is an extraordinary collaborative spirit when you are learning and growing.": "Robbie",
  "When you start learning how to give when you're young, when you get older it is second nature. Just like stealing. Start young and you keep on stealing forever. Ask my politicians.": "Mechai",
  "I became interested in educational technologies because I believe that they have the potential to transform how we practice and think about education and learning.": "Mitchel",
  "There is this tremendous body of knowledge in the world of academia where extraordinary numbers of incredibly thoughtful people have taken the time to examine on a really profound level the way we live our lives and who we are and where we've been. That brilliant learning sometimes gets trapped in academia and never sees the light of day.": "Malcolm",
  "A huge amount of success in life comes from learning as a child how to make good habits. It's good to help kids understand that when they do certain things habitually, they're reinforcing patterns.": "Charles",

  "If you look at an old piece of sheet music, there's all kinds of text on it, there are ads, there are proclamations of the greatest songs' success, there's artwork. So there is a tactile, physical experience of learning the song and the way it's notated.": "Beck",
  "I never really had the fun teens of exploring the world because I was sitting at home, learning programming.": "Markus",
  "Technology has enormous potential to address educational needs more efficiently, help teachers improve their performance, and enrich and individualize student learning.": "Wendy",

  "When a medium like games or comic books whips up such a rapture of enthusiasm, naturally we look for lessons we should be learning.": "Dave",

  "The Gross National Product measures neither our wit nor our courage, neither our wisdom nor our learning, neither our compassion nor our devotion to our country.

  "I credit Kansas City with my work ethic and learning from the amazing artists that are in that town.": "Katherine",
  "In the universities, we teach you what we decide you need to know. And the employers find out when they hire people that students didn't learn what we needed them to learn. Online learning offerings, like the University of Phoenix, have relationships with employers and teach what you need to know.": "Clayton",
  "The one thing that I keep learning over and over again is that I don't know nothing. I mean, that's my life lesson.": "Dwayne",
  "Watching movies was like going to school for me. It still is. You're always learning. Even if it's bad, you're learning what not to do.": "Loretta",
  "I still think it's essential for a parent to cook with their children. Weighing out the ingredients and learning where the food comes from is educational, but it also helps to place meal times at the heart of family life. We never had dinner in front of the TV.": "Mary",
  "I always felt called to serve, to empower and ennoble as many people as I could, teaching, truth-telling, exposing lies, bearing witness, and being willing to live and die for something bigger than yourself. I had a passion and love of learning and wisdom that was inseparable from a love of music and the arts.": "Cornel",
  "One of the things that is particularly precious about working at Apple is that many of us on the design team have worked together for 15-plus years, and there's a wonderful thing about learning as a group. A fundamental part of that is making mistakes together.": "Jonathan",
  "After 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' the films that followed it, instead of having their own unique aesthetic, they all wanted to be 'Lord of the Rings' as opposed to learning from 'Lord of the Rings.'": "Duncan",
  "In the same way that I cannot be perfect and need grace for my mistakes, I also need to give my kids grace. I am constantly learning to be patient with them, understanding that they won't do everything right all the time, while still holding them to a high standard, as their heavenly father does.": "Benjamin",
  "I learned to dive in Belize, which is sort of like learning to drive in an Aston Martin. The reefs and refuges are some of the most dramatic in the world. But the real reason I went was to dive the Blue Hole, a 400 ft. sinkhole near Ambergris Caye. Google it, and you'll see why.": "Marcus",
  "Most of my hobbies involve athletics and outdoor activities. I'm willing to learn about anything and converse and pick people's brains, and I ask people to do the same. I'm into learning anything new and trying new stuff.": "Roman",
  "What you start learning is that to get over a breakup, you kind of have to live through the emotions and not run away from it because then it lasts longer.": "Bebe",
  "It's very rare that you can be in a career for as long as I have and still feel like you're constantly learning and coming at it from an almost childlike perspective.": "Timothy",

  "The world of learning is so broad, and the human soul is so limited in power!": "Maria",
  "I spent a lot of time in the school psychologist's office. I didn't apply myself. My mother thought I had learning disabilities.": "Roger",
  "What I've come to know is that in life, it's not always the questions we ask, but rather our ability to hear the answers that truly enriches our understanding. Never, never stop learning.": "Lester",
  "Learning about factory farms and their horrendous treatment of animals is what made me become vegetarian in the first place. I also support the education of the public on adopting pets from animal shelters or saving homeless animals off the street in lieu of buying them from pet shops.": "Laura",
  "I've had maybe 20 jobs, big and small, and I've never hated any of them. At the same time, the moment the learning curve flattened, I was out of there.": "Douglas",
  "In today's world, learning has become the key to economic prosperity, social cohesion and personal fulfillment. We can no longer afford to educate the few to think, and the many to do.": "David",
  "This much I have learned: human beings come with very different sets of wiring, different interests, different temperaments, different learning styles, different gifts, different temptations. These differences are tremendously important in the spiritual formation of human beings.": "John",
  "When you dance together, there's a fabulous interaction. It's quite intimate. You're touching your partner, leading them. Learning how to behave in that person's proximity is a skill. I love it. I can't imagine tiring of it.": "Anton",
  "I'm fascinated by the idea of disparate, difficult people learning to trust each other when they're thrust into hellish circumstances.": "Sharon",
  "You make a decision whether you just work on the script and believe in every moment and pick out every moment, or if you sit down and memorize lines. Once you really dig into a script, learning lines becomes almost second nature.": "Adria",
  "I went to work in accounting at Arthur Andersen. At one point, it was the creme de la creme. I wanted to work there because it looked like the hardest thing I could find, and I loved being on a steep learning curve. I progressed quickly, and two years out of college, I was managing a small team of people.": "Lynn",
  "The paradigm of the 'Aquarian Conspiracy' sees humankind embedded in nature. It promotes the autonomous individual in a decentralized society... The new perspective respects the ecology of everything: birth, death, learning, health, family, work, science, spirituality, the arts, the community, relationships, politics.": "Marilyn",
  "Many institutions of higher learning will grant an 18- to 30-month deferral to prospective missionaries. This will enable you elders and sisters to serve without worrying about where you will begin your advanced education. We are very grateful to leaders of educational institutions who are making such planning possible!": "Russell",
  "We must educate and train our children to compete and succeed in the 21st century. Our kids are not going to grow up to compete with children in Alabama or Mississippi. They're going to grow up to compete with kids in India, and China, all over the world; children who are learning to compete and succeed in the 21st century themselves.": "Marco",
  "No man ever prayed heartily without learning something.": "Ralph",
  "I like to think of my behavior in the sixties as a 'learning experience.' Then again, I like to think of anything stupid I've done as a 'learning experience.' It makes me feel less stupid.": "P.",
  "I grew up going to public school, and they were huge public schools. I went to a school that had 3,200 kids, and I had grade school classes with 40-some kids. Discipline was rigid. Most of the learning was rote. It worked.": "P.",
  "The young are adept at learning, but even more adept at avoiding it.": "P.",
  "My whole life has been learning to lead, from my parents, to my education, to the experience I had in the private sector, to helping run the Olympics, and then of course helping guide a state.": "Mitt",
  "Each year has been so robust with problems and successes and learning experiences and human experienes that a year is a lifetime at Apple. So this has been ten lifetimes.": "Steve",
  "Learning to live for others isn't something that just comes naturally to anybody. You have to train yourself to do it.": "Joyce",

  "I can remember at the age of about six being fascinated by the planets and learning all about Mars and Venus and things.": "Richard",
  "I don't like books that seem to want to teach me things. Which is not to say that one doesn't learn from books - but you do your own learning in your own way.": "Salman",
  "We should always be learning. However, we must be careful not to set aside our faith in the process, because faith actually enhances our ability to learn.": "Joseph",
  "I think that between 27 and 37 was a really big learning decade.": "Kate",
  "Deficiency motivation doesn't work. It will lead to a life-long pursuit of try to fix me. Learn to appreciate what you have and where and who you are.": "Wayne",
  "Defense is a definite part of the game, and a great part of defense is learning to play it without fouling.": "John",
  "Mars, we know, was once wet and warm. Was it home to life? And what can living and learning to work on its rust-colored surface teach us about the future of our own planet, Earth? Answering those mysteries may hold the key to our future.": "Buzz",
  "You discover yourself through the research of your work.": "Carine",
  "I am from the age of magazines, so the Internet is terrifying to me. But I am learning.": "Carine",
  "So I've seen life as one long learning process. And if I see - you know, if I fly on somebody else's airline and find the experience is not a pleasant one, which it wasn't in - 21 years ago, then I'd think, well, you know, maybe I can create the kind of airline that I'd like to fly on.": "Richard",

  "We really are creatures of a violent world, biologically speaking - watching violence and learning about it is one of our cognitive drives.": "Steven",
  "As a graduate student, I wrote a long paper connecting the dots between mathematical models of learning and language development in children. It was published in a major journal.": "Steven",
  "I've never argued that humans are massively hot-wired. What I was trying to point out was that you can't understand how we learn unless you identify the learning mechanisms. And these have some genetic basis.": "Steven",
  "Community development has a long history of innovation and learning from experience.": "Ben",
  "I'm learning with the older that I get that some feelings are just universal and that I'm not the only one who hates their hair or their life at times.": "Brie",
  "I didn't have a regular school experience and wanted a more abstract way of learning. I started exploring in lots of different creative ways. It gave me the opportunity to travel and play music, so it was good for me.": "Brie",
  "I don't take roles that are 'just another role.' I'm interested in learning more about myself and about humanity. So it should change you by the time it's done.": "Brie",
  "Each step of the way, I'm learning. When I leave an interview, I learn whether I feel, 'Oh, that was nice,' or that made me feel like a little piece of me was taken.": "Brie",
  "I really love learning about animals. I pull from a deck of spirit animal cards. You pull one, and it's about 50 or 60 different animals, and then that day you read whichever animal you pull. And it kind of gives you insight.": "Brie",
  "I love mythology and folklore, and I respect the time, money, and opportunity that a film gives to an audience. It's a chance to empathize, reflect, and learn, so I really want to understand before I sign onto a project: 'What's the potential of this thing? What are we seeing and learning? What are we empathizing to?'": "Brie",
  "I just really like learning. I have to keep using my brain; otherwise, I get depressed.": "Brie",
  "I just don't want to stop finding things interesting. I don't want to ever stop learning. I want to be a weird encyclopedia of bizarre knowledge.": "Brie",
  "Each step of the way I'm learning. When I leave an interview, I learn whether I feel, 'Oh, that was nice,' or that made me feel like a little piece of me was taken. It's a line that is always on the edge of being crossed, and once you cross it, what's next?": "Brie",
  "Learning to read clusters is not something your eyes do naturally. It takes constant practice.": "Bill",
  "Tons of comedians have said, 'I grew up learning from Bill Cosby. He's great.' But that respect doesn't mean much to the young people. They like their ginger ale with hot sauce.": "Bill",
  "The ego is there, but I'm learning to channel it.": "Ridley",
  "I'm still at the beginning of my career. It's all a little new, and I'm still learning as I go.": "Orlando",

  "I love learning, and I think that curiosity is a wonderful gift.": "Andie",
  "Since truffle oil and caviar aren't always in the budget, learning to tweak and enhance just a few ingredients and flavor combinations can help you transform those ordinary ingredients into the extraordinary!": "Marcus",
  "I love cookbooks for completely different reasons. I love 'The Harry's Bar Cookbook' and Marco-Pierre White's 'White Heat' for their feel. For pure learning, Gray Kunz wrote a great cookbook, 'The Elements of Taste', published in 2001. The first time I read Charlie Trotter's, the Chicago chef's first cookbook, I was blown away.": "Marcus",
  "Learning, n. The kind of ignorance distinguishing the studious.": "Ambrose",
  "If you're eight and you live in Los Angeles and everybody has toys and you go to a country that has a Marxist dictatorship and there are no toy stores and nobody speaks English and it's blazing hot every day and they only have fish, which you don't like, then you tend not to appreciate the cultural lessons you're learning.": "Zooey",
  "When I exercise, I like to take lots of different classes because I want to really apply myself and feel like I'm learning a new skill. Not that I ever want to have to demonstrate any of those skills!": "Zooey",
  "You can be self-empowered and still learning about how you think about things daily.": "Tori",
  "I personally always find something really scary about watching little girls learning to manipulate their dads by baby talking. Then they grow up and use the same technique on their boyfriends or husbands. That scares me because it's just so sick on so many levels.": "Megan",
  "We have got this tailspin of culture, in our inner cities in particular, of men not working and just generations of men not even thinking about working or learning the value and the culture of work, and so there is a real culture problem here that has to be dealt with.": "Paul",
  "I can install toilets. I know all about the wax ring. I can tile floors. I'm learning how to do basic wiring.": "Sandra",
  "I chose 'No. 1 Ladies' Detective,' or I'll say it chose me, and it was an absolute blessing, for the experience of being in Africa for seven months and learning so many different things, from languages to foods to greetings. On so many levels, it was an incredible experience.": "Jill",
  "God is being taken out of schools; children are not being raised in church learning the word; many parents are living lives unto themselves, exalting substance rather than Jesus Christ, and those looking for answers are going to church and finding the word is not being preached. There are consequences to these decisions.": "Monica",
  "Learning to give up on perfection may be just about the most romantic move any of us could make.": "Alain",
  "I graduated from college with a degree in ex-phys and kinesiology, because it was learning to work out, and I already knew how to work out. So, I just wanted an easy degree. I'm sorry but that's just the way it was.": "John",
  "The pathological degree to which former Vice President Dick Cheney operated in secrecy led to government abuses that we'll probably spend years learning about.": "Timothy",
  "The most vulnerable people have tough exteriors because they are very scared inside, and it's very hard for people like that - people like me - to open up. But playing it safe means you stop being open to learning. I always try to find the challenges.": "Christina",
  "I think my type of personality has all music inside of it, so I am full of music, without even knowing it, without even learning it, without even hearing it.": "Ziggy",
  "I did all of my learning on 'My Fair Lady.'": "Julie",
  "When I did 'The Sound of Music' and 'Mary Poppins' and 'The Americanization of Emily,' all three were in the can and had not yet been released.

  "Making distinctions is part of learning. So is making mistakes.": "Nancy",
  "A good part of my leadership skills is crafted from learning from experiences early in my career that were not positive experiences.": "John",

  "I'm not going to school just for the academics - I wanted to share ideas, to be around people who are passionate about learning.": "Emma",
  "For me, riding a two-wheeler bike was very risky. Counting the pedal strokes before turning a corner and learning to hear the sounds coming from buildings, grass and the climbing frame made all the difference to basic survival and ensured that I didn't end up head-first in the sandpit.": "Andrea",
  "Students teach all sorts of things but most importantly they make explicit the courage that it takes to be a learner, the courage it takes to open yourself to the transformative power of real learning and that courage I am exposed to almost every day at MIT and that I'm deeply grateful for.": "Junot",
  "If we study learning as a data science, we can reverse engineer the human brain and tailor learning techniques to maximize the chances of student success. This is the biggest revolution that could happen in education, turning it into a data-driven science, and not such a medieval set of rumors professors tend to carry on.": "Sebastian",

  "Love of learning led to monasteries, which became the cradle of academic guilds.": "John",
  "When you a darker brunette and have pale skin like I do, it can wash you out a bit, so learning to contour is really helpful. I think you can be a bit more bold with eye makeup to define your eyes, and the same with lip colors - you can go for dark wine colors, which I love.": "Olivia",
  "I should be learning another language and working out more, but I'm just always saying, 'Ah, I could get hit by a bus tomorrow.'": "Melissa",
  "Learning certain things purely through memory is related to the developmental forces that are present between the sixth or seventh year and the fourteenth year of life. This quality of human nature is what mathematical instruction should be based on.": "Rudolf",
  "What is important is to treat everyone like an individual and learning not to generalize autism. With autism, people make assumptions, but it's very broad, and everyone's so different. You have to treat each person as an individual.": "Nikki",

  "The deep learning techniques, while relatively easy to learn, are quite foreign to traditional engineering modalities. It takes a different mindset and a relaxation of the presumption of control. The practitioners are like magi, sequestered from the rest of a typical engineering process.": "Steve",
  "I am always suspicious of those who impose 'rules' on child rearing. Every child is different in terms of temperament and learning, and every parent responds to a particular child, not some generalized infant or youngster.": "Siri",
  "Science is you! It's your head, it's your dog, it's your iPhone - it's the world. How do you see that as boring? If it's boring, it's because you're learning it from a textbook.": "Mary",

  "In order to protect against being disrupted, startups also need to recruit employees that are committed to life-long learning. The skills that made your team members valuable may not be the skills needed to take your company to the next level or to compete in emerging markets.": "Jay",
  "I was lucky enough to be fairly quick at understanding what was taught, but unlucky enough not to be really interested in it, so I always got my exams but never had the scholar's love of learning for its own sake.": "Maeve",
  "I love figuring out a stranger, sitting down and learning about their loves and struggles and everything. People are my jam.": "Cara",
  "I always feel that life can teach you how to act. I'm always looking at life through other people's eyes. By feeling empathy. And I do feel that I am constantly learning.": "Cara",

  "I love nature and enjoy learning new skills.": "Leona",
  "I loved learning to fight and kill zombies.": "Lily",
  "I'm learning a lot about how to be one of the 'good' actors. You'd hope that it's natural to be a good person, and kind, but I'm learning how to deal with long, sometimes boring days.": "Lily",
  "I think one thing as far as my learning curve and what I'm learning - there is a time to take a sack, and then there is also a time to try to find a way to maybe throw the ball at a receiver's feet.": "Brock",
  "Women and men look at their life, and women say, 'What do I need? Do I need more money, or do I need more time?' And women are intelligent enough to say, 'I need more time.' And so, women lead balanced lives; men should be learning from women.": "Warren",
  "Interestingly, simple and ordinary experiences often provide the most important learning opportunities we ever have.": "David",
  "Wisdom has never made a bigot, but learning has.": "Josh",
  "I was not good in school. I could never read very fast or very well. I got tested for learning disabilities, for dyslexia. Then I got put on Ritalin and Dexedrine. I took those starting in the eighth grade. As soon as they pumped that drug into me, it would focus me right in.": "Channing",
  "You can always tell gifted and highly intelligent people as they always turn to the past. Any young person who knows anything that happened before 1980, or 1990, or 2000 for that matter, is immediately someone who is intelligent, probably creative, maybe a writer. Nobody who is drawn to the past and learning about the past is not gifted.": "Mike",
  "I miss the early days; I do. I was so lucky. I basically had it to myself, learning about these chimpanzees. Nobody knew anything about them. Discovering their different personalities, different life histories. I was lucky.": "Jane",
  "It is always good to explore the stuff you don't agree with, to try and understand a different lifestyle or foreign worldview. I like to be challenged in that way, and always end up learning something I didn't know.": "Laura",
  "I'm learning how to keep my identity and personal life sacred. It's a matter of knowing my limits. I don't have to give everything that's asked of me.": "Mary",
  "I've always felt that work - learning from people who know more than I know - is what keeps you going.": "Lauren",
  "Oprah was not somebody who was telling us what to do, she wasn't really teaching us like so many people we see today. With Oprah, she was learning and we were learning with her. And I think that's really was the seed that was planted for all of us to just hang in there with her.": "Bonnie",
  "Snapchat's the place where people are hearing and learning about culture.": "Diplo",
  "I can get motivated seeing a kid at my son's school overcome a learning disability.": "Jason",
  "Words are but wind; and learning is nothing but words; ergo, learning is nothing but wind.": "Jonathan",
  "We're not that much smarter than we used to be, even though we have much more information - and that means the real skill now is learning how to pick out the useful information from all this noise.": "Nate",
  "I started writing when I was around 6. I say 'writing,' but it was really just making up stuff! I started writing and doing my own thing. I didn't really know what a demo was or anything like that, so I started getting interested in studio gear and started learning about one instrument at a time. My first instrument was an accordion.": "Hunter",
  "By keeping my hand in that, it's the way I keep learning. The main way you learn in medicine is by practicing and working with patients.": "Andrew",
  "I always love it when I hear back from kids who say they discovered Percy Jackson and now wear their learning difference as a badge of honour.": "Rick",
  "I've been dancing since I was two, learning so many different styles. I like dancing to rap and hip-hop, but also the Strokes, the Hives, and the Vines with carefree randomness. There's always a way to move to something.": "Jillian",
  "An unschooled man who knows how to meditate upon the Lord has learned far more than the man with the highest education who does not know how to meditate.": "Charles",
  "Adults often assume that most learning is the result of teaching and that exploratory, spontaneous learning is unusual. But actually, spontaneous learning is more fundamental.": "Alison",
  "All we do as songwriters is rewrite the songs that have impressed us till we find our own voice. It's part of learning the craft.": "Steve",
  "Pregnant women who are in places where Zika is spreading should do everything they can to avoid mosquito bites. And we, as a society, need to do everything we can to control Zika. That means learning more about it; that means controlling mosquitoes more effectively. That means achieving a vaccine.": "Tom",
  "It is paradoxical that many educators and parents still differentiate between a time for learning and a time for play without seeing the vital connection between them.": "Leo",
  "I'm always going to be making costumes. It's one of the ways I relax my brain. In addition to the pleasure of having the piece, there is a deep and abiding pleasure for me assembling something in my head - learning to know something in its totality in my head, and then putting together all the constituent parts into a cohesive whole.": "Adam",
  "I was studying for the SAT's and learning lines.": "Joseph",
  "What I'm still grappling with and learning how to do is to be looking and thinking cinematically, having come from television.": "J.",
  "In the matter of learning, the difference between the earnest and the careless student stands out clearly. The same holds true in the mastering of passion and the weaknesses to which our nature is subject, as in the acquiring of virtue.": "Saint",
  "Every time I come across learning items of interest, I'll send distribution voice mail to the appropriate group in the organization.": "Fred",
  "My father is a chemist, my mother was a homemaker. My parents instilled in us the feeling that learning was the most exciting thing that could happen to you, and it never ends.": "Rita",
  "The role of the musician is to go from concept to full execution. Put another way, it's to go from understanding the content of something to really learning how to communicate it and make sure it's well-received and lives in somebody else.": "Yo-Yo",
  "I consider social skills a bit like learning a language. I've been practising it for so long over so many years I've almost lost my accent.": "Daniel",
  "For me, art is about learning and about living with people. It's alive.": "Miuccia",
  "My learning process is by eye alone it's not at all scientific.": "Miuccia",
  "A man of great memory without learning hath a rock and a spindle and no staff to spin.": "George",
  "I'm so supported, and I'm so privileged. So many women today are single parents; I don't feel different. I think you get out of life what you put into it... and Bluebell was a beautiful accident. I feel blessed to have her. I'm learning every day as a mother.": "Geri",
  "I had a pretty steep learning curve in film - as I'm still learning.": "Theo",
  "With all of the people in Cuba who I met - many of them hugely heroic figures - I found learning about their complexity and richness and contradictions just really fascinating, and it was fulfilling to be able to offer a different side to them, to be able to have some kind of unique takeaway from the official narrative.": "Brin-Jonathan",
  "Because I never plan anything out ahead of time, I'm always in the process of learning about my characters. Without a biographical sketch to guide me, I discover things about my heroines as the stories unfold. Only in 'Body Double' did I discover that Maura's mother was a serial killer.": "Tess",
  "There are so many artists that are dyslexic or learning disabled, it's just phenomenal. There's also an unbelievably high proportion of artists who are left-handed, and a high correlation between left-handedness and learning disabilities.": "Chuck",
  "Everybody's a work in progress. I'm a work in progress. I mean, I've never arrived... I'm still learning all the time.": "Renee",

  "The only animals I'm not comfortable with are parrots, but I'm learning as I go. I'm getting better and better at 'em. I really am.": "Steve",
  "People who stay unemployed for a long time start to look like damaged goods, and they don't get such good offers. Also, they're not learning anything. Most learning is on-the-job learning.": "Robert",
  "I became popular very young. I viewed myself as just a young actor trying to figure out how to do well, and, you know, making mistakes and learning and growing.": "Josh",
  "A tough lesson in life that one has to learn is that not everybody wishes you well.": "Dan",
  "There are some aspects of work you need to keep working on and no matter what environment you are in. Continuous learning is very important. It's what I call 'competitive tension', which is about having a competition around.": "Viswanathan",
  "I eventually became proud of my strikeouts, because each one represented another learning experience.": "Willie",
  "With learning lines, before I had Alfie, I'd put it off and think, 'Oh, I'll just have a glass of wine and then do it later,' but when you've finally got a child to bed and you know you've only got an hour, then you achieve so much.": "Lesley",
  "To Catholic, Orthodox, and some Protestant Christians, communion involves partaking of the physical real presence of God in the bread and wine of the Eucharist. By contrast, the Torah draws the Jew into engagement with God's infinite mind. Torah learning is the definitive Jewish mode of communion with God.": "Meir",
  "I like learning stuff. The more information you can get about a person or a subject, the more you can pour into a potential project. I made a decision to do different things. I want to do things that have a better chance of being thought of as original. I do everything I can to disrupt my comfort zone.": "Brian",
  "I enjoy living life and I enjoy going to different restaurants and eating my way through a country and going to different museums and learning about different cultures.": "Mila",
  "Education in general, and higher education in particular, is on the brink of a huge disruption. Two big questions, which were once so well-settled that we ceased asking them, are now up for grabs. What should young people be learning? And what sorts of credentials indicate they're ready for the workforce?": "Dan",
  "There are hurdles to overcome in sport and in life. Sport is a very valuable learning ground for how to live your life in the best possible way.": "Lynn",
  "There are people who think they know everything about everything. What they don't know is that every moment is a learning moment.": "Mickey",
  "'Glee' is very easy to clown because I feel like it's just crumbling. 'Smash!' 'Smash' is the ultimate. I love it because I'm all about theater. I did plays in high school and college, and it totally brings me back to that feeling: how excited you get on opening night, how it sucks when you're not learning the dance moves.": "Retta",
  "Let ignorance talk as it will, learning has its value.": "Jean",
  "You could double the number of synaptic connections in a very simple neurocircuit as a result of experience and learning. The reason for that was that long-term memory alters the expression of genes in nerve cells, which is the cause of the growth of new synaptic connections.": "Eric",
  "Doctoral training is devoted almost entirely to learning to do research, even though most Ph.Ds who enter academic life spend far more time teaching than they do conducting experiments or writing books.": "Derek",
  "First grade was - I spoke only Spanish, and second grade - probably a bit more English. And by the time I hit third grade, I was learning, of course, much, much more English.": "Juan",
  "There is, so I believe, in the essence of everything, something that we cannot call learning. There is, my friend, only a knowledge - that is everywhere.": "Hermann",
  "Part of my training was learning how to refer patients to cardiologists for heart problems, gastroenterologists for stomach issues, and rheumatologists for joint pain. Given that most physicians were trained this way, it's no wonder that the average Medicare patient has six doctors and is on five different medications.": "Mark",
  "You can learn as much about the history from reading about the present as you can vice versa, that is learning about the present through history, which is what I do for a living.": "Ken",
  "I brought a Border Collie back home to Vancouver from Wales - where some of my ancestors are from - and needed to challenge him in other ways than just being my pet. So I investigated sheep herding and took a few lessons, and decided I was probably learning more than my dog!": "Jane",
  "I believe that our teachers need more freedom to be creative in the classroom in order to maximize the time students spend learning, not the time they spend taking tests.": "Gary",
  "It has been said that 80% of what people learn is visual.": "Allen",
  "That was the reasoning behind learning to play bass, and then after that it was more like it was neat to play songs together - for me to play bass and for him to play guitar.": "Tom",
  "I think there's so much negative influence on children in school settings. It becomes learning by rote to pass a test. It's not contextualized.": "Esperanza",
  "I've teamed up with one of the headmasters at Eton College, and we're spearheading a kind of 'slow education movement in Britain'. It's based on this idea of moving away from the fast-food approach to learning and going to something deeper, more woolly, harder to measure.": "Carl",
  "As I was coming up, it always seemed like I was learning. If it wasn't from school, it was the 'hood. The influences of the 'hood are very powerful.": "Junior",
  "There is a great book out called 'Everything I Needed to Learn I Learned in Kindergarten,' and I believe that everything I ever needed to learn on guitar was in my first two years of hungry learning: Scotty Moore, Hank Marvin, Chet Atkins, Lenny Breau, Chuck Berry and Bo Diddley.": "Randy",
  "Virtue comes by nature, learning, and practice, and thanks to virtue, all of the aforesaid may deserve approval.": "Apollonius",
  "Particularly for English people, Shakespeare is always at the forefront of both drama and the English language. He's always been there. I can't remember starting school and not learning about him.": "Jamie",
  "The purpose of a moral philosophy is not to look delightfully strange and counterintuitive or to provide employment to bioethicists. The purpose is to guide our choices toward life, health, beauty, happiness, fun, laughter, challenge, and learning.": "Eliezer",
  "I think there's a lot of learning process in figuring out what things you want to do and shouldn't do. Maturing in that way is something that comes with experience and time.": "Matt",
  "I feel like that I'm learning all the time. I'm learning from new artists, from established artists... every time I listen to '70s rock 'n' roll records, I'm learning. And I think that I'm just now starting to get a hold on what I do.": "Tim",
  "Quality afterschool programs provide safe, engaging and fun learning experiences to help children and youth develop their social, emotional, physical, cultural and academic skills.": "Debbie",
  "In a deeply tribal sense, we love our monsters, and I think that is the key to it right there. It is monsters; it is learning about them: it is both thrill and safety. You can think of them without being desperately afraid because they are not going to come into your living room and eat you. That is 'Jaws.'": "Peter",
  "I'm learning how to live in the present and be grateful for what's working rather than look for the 'what's not working' piece.": "Ali",
  "I lived in a world where social arrangements were taken for granted and assumed to be timeless. A child's obligation was to learn these usages, not to question them. The complexities of racial deportment were of a piece with learning manners and etiquette more generally.": "Drew",
  "I've said many times, 'You learn to win through not liking to lose.' And that's what I mean by learning how to win.": "Tom",
  "What you learn from working with other performers and musicians is invaluable, really, and can only help you grow. I mean, if you spend your whole life focusing on yourself, you're not really learning much.": "Damon",
  "I grew up listening to Jay-Z, and I think the first time I really became obsessed with learning and thinking about lyrics was when I started listening to rap; I was 11, 12, and started becoming aware of music beyond the familiar.": "Ezra",
  "Learning to love my inner and outer beauty wasn't an easy road. I still don't always love the reflection I see in the mirror, but I have learned that my outer appearance does not define me.": "Katherine",
  "Puppet camp truly redefined my preconceptions of puppetry... I'll never forget learning that before a puppet can speak... he has to inhale. It's those details that make the characters truly come to life.": "Rob",
  "But if somebody dies, if something happens to you, there is a normal process of depression, it is part of being human, and some people view it as a learning experience etc.": "Bob",
  "A love of books, of holding a book, turning its pages, looking at its pictures, and living its fascinating stories goes hand-in-hand with a love of learning.": "Laura",
  "The failures and successes are necessary for learning.": "Wynonna",
  "The Company of Wolves is about how society teaches young women to look at themselves, and what to be afraid of. It's about a girl learning that the world of sensuality and the unknown is not to be feared, that it's worth getting your teeth into.": "Neil",
  "I have two different categories of favorite films. One is the emotional favorites, which means these are generally films that I saw when I was a kid; anything you see in your formative years is more powerful, because it really stays with you forever. The second category is films that I saw while I was learning the craft of motion pictures.": "John",
  "I think what makes 'Jeopardy!' special is that, among all the quiz and game shows out there, ours tends to encourage learning.": "Alex",
  "Skillshare is a terrific online learning community for creative people. It teaches you new skills through well-made videos with great production values. I've been using Skillshare to teach myself Adobe After Effects. All the videos feature people who are professionals in their field. I love this site.": "Mark",
  "Someday, I plan to buy a house in Goa, do only one movie a year, and spend the rest of time painting, learning how to cook, cooking for friends, and doing yoga.": "Ranveer",
  "Never stand still. Only stand still enough to learn, and once you stop learning in that stance, move off. Always keep yourself engaged, in theater, in whatever job you can get. If you can't get an acting job, then go backstage. Or take tickets. But be around actors because that is where you will primarily learn.": "Ed",
  "I have terrible handwriting. I now say it's a learning disability... but a nun who was a very troubled woman hit me over the fingers with a ruler because my writing was so bad.": "Andrew",
  "And where does magic come from? I think that magic's in the learning.": "Dar",
  "I guess I'm a good manager now. Moreover, I'm loving the concept of donning the producer's hat. It's all very exciting as well as a great learning experience. You're a part of a film right from its conception to its execution, and that's an amazing feeling.": "Malaika",
  "I've never stopped learning.": "Mick",
  "Of course everybody's thinking evolves over time. Only dead people cease learning, and I am not certified dead yet. So I am still learning.": "Meles",
  "Learn as much by writing as by reading.": "Lord",
  "Every election matters. Anyone that tells you otherwise doesn't understand politics. That said, not every election sends sweeping messages that are easy to discern, but every election provides lessons worth learning.": "Chuck",
  "Lie detection is like language there is a learning window. Telling whoppers to small children seems to be a family tradition in many families.": "Keith",
  "Isn't one of your first exercises in learning how to communicate to write a description of how to tie your shoelaces? The point being that it's basically impossible to use text to show that.": "Donald",
  "Most sailing ships take what they call trainees, who pay to be part of the crew. The Picton Castle takes people who are absolutely raw recruits. But you can't just ride along. You're learning to steer the ship, navigation; you're pulling lines, keeping a lookout; in the galley you're cooking.": "Billy",
  "The best schools tend to have the best teachers, not to mention parents who supervise homework, so there is less need for self-organised learning. But where a child comes from a less supportive home environment, where there are family tensions perhaps, their schoolwork can suffer. They need to be taught to think and study for themselves.": "Sugata",
  "I remember a conversation with my parents about who the people on the TV were, and learning they were actors and they acted out this story and just thinking that was the most fantastic notion, and that's what I want to do.": "David",

  "All the children of the great men in Persia are brought up at court, where they have an opportunity of learning great modesty, and where nothing immodest is ever heard or seen.": "Xenophon",
  "Also, they don't understand - writing is language. The use of language. The language to create image, the language to create drama. It requires a skill of learning how to use language.": "John",

  "Churchill was the canny political animal, very devious, bursting with energy and determination, learning as hard as he could.": "Lord",

  "Learning how to work and learning how to fail is important.": "Jamie",
  "People take years learning how to act; it's a skill, not just a job. If I tried it out and thought I'd be OK, then perhaps I'd go for it, but it's not the kind of thing you can get into just because of your looks.": "Travis",
  "I believe life is an 'experience ball.' You throw it at someone, it picks up their response... it grows. You play with that ball, learning what it teaches you.": "Vijay",
  "Well, until this very day, I'm still learning.": "Dennis",
  "Of course, learning is strengthened and solidified when it occurs in a safe, secure and normal environment.": "Jean-Bertrand",

  "It's like saying French shouldn't be taught because you don't understand it because it's new. Shakespeare is just like learning a new, exciting language.": "Samuel",
  "I'm learning with my mom how to cook more Spanish food. I'm trying to make a good paella, but that's a real art.": "Daniel",

  "My earliest memory is learning to read 'Muffin the Mule' when I was about three.": "Mark",
  "But, if you observe children learning in their first few years of life, you can see that they can and do learn on their own - we leave them alone to crawl, walk, talk, and gain control over their bodies. It happens without much help from parents.": "Daniel",
  "I'm learning to deal with my loneliness because then nobody can muck me around any more.": "Amanda",
  "Like our physical bodies, our memory becomes out of shape. As children, we are constantly learning new experiences, but by the time we reach our 20s, we start to lead a more sedentary life both mentally and physically. Our lives become routine, and we stop challenging our brains, and our memory starts to suffer.": "Tony",
  "Learning is a result of listening, which in turn leads to even better listening and attentiveness to the other person. In other words, to learn from the child, we must have empathy, and empathy grows as we learn.": "Alice",
  "I took the process of doing as much myself as I could like a duck to water. I set up my own label and publishing, etc, and it was a fun learning curve two decades ago.": "David",
  "One thing I learned particularly at Yale was how to work with others. Having studied so long trying to master myself, the biggest challenge was learning about the other person's work.": "Trai",

  "I was fairly solitary. I didn't like structured learning. People didn't seem to be my cup of tea.": "Dan",
  "We cannot seek or attain health, wealth, learning, justice or kindness in general. Action is always specific, concrete, individualized, unique.": "Benjamin",

  "I am dumb when it comes to learning dance steps.": "Mia",
  "I am a huge consumer of social networks, and I utilize Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn. I'm interested and am learning more about Tumblr and other visually dominant sites.": "James",
  "Flying, for some reason, has never been my favorite thing, but after taking some aviation classes and reading about it and learning about it... They've been doing this for over a hundred years, they've been to the moon and back; they kind of have a good system going here.": "Michael",

  "There is no such whetstone, to sharpen a good wit and encourage a will to learning, as is praise.": "Roger",
  "I think I'd like to stay anchoring because, number one, I'm learning a lot, and I love it when I'm learning. And number two, I also have the luxury of a stable life.": "Linda",
  "But if we learn to think of it as anticipation, as learning, as growing, if we think of the time we spend waiting for the big things of life as an opportunity instead of a passing of time, what wonderful horizons open out!": "Anna",
  "At the very core of my relationship to learning is the idea that we should be as organic as possible. We need to cultivate a deeply refined introspective sense, and build our relationship to learning around our nuance of character.": "Joshua",
  "I'd think learning to play the guitar would be very confusing for sighted people.": "Doc",
  "Basketball, in America, is like a culture. It is like a foreigner learning a new language. It is difficult to learn foreign languages and it will also be difficult for me to learn the culture for basketball here.": "Yao",

  "You can admire people for sure, and they're worth admiring, but you need to find that special thing about yourself. It takes working hard, getting the technique, and learning to sing and all that stuff, but the master class is about bringing yourself to the role.": "Susan",
  "The whole business of reading English Literature in two years, to know it in any reputable sense of the word - let alone your learning to write English - is, in short, impossible.": "Arthur",
  "I just want to do shows because you get to see, over all the seasons, the person grow, and you get to grow with the character. That transformation, for me, is what I love about my job. I get to learn about myself and challenge myself and grow with the character. For me, it's a whole process of learning and growing.": "Justin",
  "As long as I'm learning every day of my life, I will never feel old. Never. And I don't feel old; I feel in my head and in my heart - I don't know, ageless!": "Pat",
  "The introduction of many minds into many fields of learning along a broad spectrum keeps alive questions about the accessibility, if not the unity, of knowledge.": "Edward",
  "And the thing about me is, I have a lot of mellow songs, because they're the easiest for me to write. I wanted to try to make some more upbeat songs, so, I ended up gravitating toward writing songs with friends, which was a great learning process, and also we came up with great songs. Those are the songs that came out the most naturally.": "Priscilla",
  "The best way of learning to be an independent sovereign state is to be an independent sovereign state.": "Kwame",
  "I'm only just learning what language to use when I want my microphone turned down, you know, because it's all so new to me. It can be quite difficult on a daily basis to communicate with the people I work with, so I'm just looking forward to knowing more.": "Duffy",

  "The nice thing about being a writer is that you can make magic happen without learning tricks.": "Humphrey",

  "Saving our planet, lifting people out of poverty, advancing economic growth... these are one and the same fight.

  "Temptation is like a knife, that may either cut the meat or the throat of a man; it may be his food or his poison, his exercise or his destruction.": "John",
  "We are delightfully trapped by our memories. I can't drink a bottle of Chateauneuf-du-Pape Vieux Telegraphe without revisiting a hotel bistro in Luzerne, Switzerland, where I ate a large bowl of a peppery Basque baby goat stew. A sip and a bite. A bite and sip. Goose bumps come with the divine conjunction of food and wine.": "Jim",

  "It all comes back to the basics. Serve customers the best-tasting food at a good value in a clean, comfortable restaurant, and they'll keep coming back.": "Dave",
  "In our fast-forward culture, we have lost the art of eating well. Food is often little more than fuel to pour down the hatch while doing other stuff - surfing the Web, driving, walking along the street. Dining al desko is now the norm in many workplaces.

As many colors and foods as you can eat, the better, because if you focus on one food, there's bound to be a report that comes out that says, 'Broccoli actually... ' So I mix it up a lot. And I take vitamins, like Biosil, which I take for my hair, skin, and nails.": "Christie",
  "We're all moving at such a high rate that we have to grab the frozen dinners and the McDonald's. We can't make it a way of life - we have to get back to real, simple, clean good foods.

  "The need for love and intimacy is a fundamental human need, as primal as the need for food, water, and air.": "Dean",
  "Let's face it: so much of what we consume is not driven by knowledge but by basic craving and impulse. The process of what we eat starts in our heads. And no one is more in our heads than a food industry that spends billions of dollars in marketing its message in every means possible.": "Chuck",

  "Ice cream is my comfort food.": "Jessie",
  "Bad food is made without pride, by cooks who have no pride, and no love.

  "The menu should be part of the entertainment, part of the dining experience. It's kind of like reading the 'Playbill' when you go to the theater. It should be an alluring and interactive document.

  "Food is our common ground, a universal experience.": "James",
  "I still eat a burger at a counter with ketchup dripping down my face.": "Scarlett",

  "I tell my students, it's not difficult to identify with somebody like yourself, somebody next door who looks like you. What's more difficult is to identify with someone you don't see, who's very far away, who's a different color, who eats a different kind of food.

  "Airline glamour never promised anything as mundane as elbow room, much less a flat bed, a massage, or an arugula salad. It promised a better world.

  "I don't think it ever does any harm in any business to feel that there is someone there who cares about it. If you look at any business, fashion being the most obvious, the aura, or the reality of the designer, is part of what creates it. It's true in luxury goods stores and in good food stores.

  "Chinese food tries to engage the mind, not just the palate. To provoke the intellect.": "Nicole",
  "It's like spicy food - sometimes you have to tone it down so more people can enjoy it.": "Kenneth",

  "I think America's food culture is embedded in fast-food culture. And the real question that we have is: How are we going to teach slow-food values in a fast-food world? Of course, it's very, very difficult to do, especially when children have grown up eating fast food and the values that go with that.": "Alice",

  "Now, if you notice how the swan, putting its neck down into the deep water, brings up food for itself from below, then you will discover the wisdom of the Creator, in that He gave it a neck longer than its feet for this reason, that it might, as if lowering a sort of fishing line, procure the food hidden in the deep water.": "Saint",

  "The true scientist no longer attempts to disprove the pull of gravity, or the rotation of the earth, or the motion of heavenly bodies, or the sequence of the seasons, or man's need of food and water, or the function of the heart.": "Ezra",
  "Health messages are simply overwhelmed, in volume and in effectiveness, by junk-food ads that often deploy celebrities or cartoon characters to great effect.

  "Food should be fun.": "Thomas",

  "Without sharks, you take away the apex predator of the ocean, and you destroy the entire food chain.": "Peter",
  "When it comes to Chinese food I have always operated under the policy that the less known about the preparation the better. A wise diner who is invited to visit the kitchen replies by saying, as politely as possible, that he has a pressing engagement elsewhere.": "Calvin",

  "While weight loss is important, what's more important is the quality of food you put in your body - food is information that quickly changes your metabolism and genes.": "Mark",
  "I think the biggest thing is clean as you go. Wash all your knives, cutting boards, dishes, when you are done cooking, not look at a sink full of dishes after you are done. Cleaning as you go helps keep away cross contamination and you avoid having food borne bacteria.": "Cat",
  "Southeast Asia food uses many different types of spices which are quite new to me, like the curry leaves which I saw at the Kreta Ayer wet market in Chinatown. With such spices used in cooking, this usually imparts a strong aroma to Southeast Asian food, which appeals to the senses.": "Joel",
  "I love flying so much. I even like airplane food. No one bothers you and your phone never goes off and you can't have emails go through. It's undisturbed.": "Margot",

  "I don't know if you call a burger 'recession food.' It's comfort food.": "Michael",
  "So much of the world's suffering results from the sinful action or inaction of ourselves and others. For example, people look at a famine and wonder where God is, but the world produces enough food for each person to have 3,000 calories a day. It's our own irresponsibility and self-centeredness that prevents people from getting fed.": "Lee",

  "Orange juice from concentrate is labeled. Food coloring Red #5 is labeled. Fish are labeled as to whether they've been previously frozen. To a consumer, there's no plausible reason why these factors should be on a food ingredient label while the presence of GMOs shouldn't be.": "Ramez",

  "We can't get to the $4 trillion in savings that we need by just cutting the 12 percent of the budget that pays for things like medical research and education funding and food inspectors and the weather service. And we can't just do it by making seniors pay more for Medicare.": "Barack",

  "First and foremost I am a chef, whether behind the stove at one of my Northern California restaurants or for the past 15 years in front of the camera on my Food Network cooking shows.

  "The primary requisite for writing well about food is a good appetite. Without this, it is impossible to accumulate, within the allotted span, enough experience of eating to have anything worth setting down.": "A.",
  "The food in the House of Commons is fairly good.

  "Cats are very independent animals. They're very sexy, if you want. Dogs are different. They're familiar. They're obedient. You call a cat, you go, 'Cat, come here.' He doesn't come to you unless you have something in your hand that he thinks might be food. They're very free animals, and I like that.": "Antonio",

  "There are two books that I often travel with; one is 'The Theory on Moral Sentiments' by Adam Smith. The other is 'The Meditations.'

  "Italy has great food and Barcelona has great energy.": "Stefon",
  "Do but stand still in the hour of trial, and you will see the help of God, if you trust in Him. But there is so often a forsaking the ways of the Lord in the hour of trial, and thus the food of faith, the means whereby our faith may be increased, is lost.": "George",
  "I love sitcoms, and I grew up on sitcoms. That's my tasty junk food.": "Felicia",
  "I love food: biscuits and gravy, cheese grits, spaghetti and meatballs, chicken-fried steak with white gravy... but my favorite dish is my wife's beanie weenie cornbread casserole. It's so good.

  "All food is comfort food. Maybe I just like to chew.": "Lewis",

  "My food demons are Chinese food, sugar, butter.": "Kirstie",
  "In World War II, jazz absolutely was the music of freedom, and then in the Cold War, behind the Iron Curtain, same thing. It was all underground, but they needed the food of freedom that jazz offered.": "Herbie",

  "We have soon to have everywhere smoke annihilators, dust absorbers, ozonizers, sterilizers of water, air, food and clothing, and accident preventers on streets, elevated roads and in subways. It will become next to impossible to contract disease germs or get hurt in the city, and country folk will got to town to rest and get well.": "Nikola",
  "I learned to cook in self-defense. My wife doesn't know what a kitchen is. In the first month of our marriage, she broiled lamb chops 26 nights in a row. Then I took over. I used to mind her not caring about food, but no more - as long as I can eat what I want.": "Alan",
  "People come up to me all the time and ask how I stay the way I am, and it's no secret. The first lesson a chef needs to learn is how to handle a knife; the second is how to be around all that food.": "Marcus",
  "Food that's served at the table in a paper parcel always creates a remarkable culinary moment when opened, because the package is full of aromatic steam from the lightly cooked ingredients inside.": "Yotam",
  "I love trying out different cuisines. In Delhi, I love Megu at the Leela, and TK's at the Hyatt. I also enjoy Khan Chacha's rolls. In Mumbai, it's Royal China and Shiro. And in Bangalore, I like the food at Bricklane.": "Virat",
  "I'm Italian. I love to cook Italian food, so I learned from my dad how to make sauce and meatballs and all that stuff. With my wife and kids, I started making homemade pasta. The very first time, I didn't have a pasta maker, so I had to cut it with a knife, the old-school way! The noodles were all jacked up, but it was fun.": "Joey",
  "Milan, for me, is a city of discovery. You can find some amazing gardens behind some great houses; I also love finding beautiful galleries and incredible shops, but you have to explore. And the food is amazing.": "Francisco",
  "I was mischievous. I wasn't bad. I stole food so we could eat. My mother didn't know. I used to tell her some man gave me $10 to sweep out the yard. I was like Robin Hood. I took from the rich and gave to the poor. Me.": "Mr.",

  "Roast beef, medium, is not only a food. It is a philosophy.": "Edna",
  "When I eat cilantro, it's like someone sprayed perfume down my throat. It closes up my throat, even if there's only a little piece.

Then there's always that one little piece that falls in, and I gag.": "Amber",
  "Global warming will threaten our crops, so natural food will be scarce. Hourglass, curvy bodies will be the aspirational beauty standard, representing that those women have access to bounties of fulfilling yet healthy food, which means they are affluent.": "Tyra",
  "I'm very conscious about putting good food into my body. Years ago, I went to see an amazing healer called Allah, who could read your body. She told me that I can't absorb vitamins very well, and I have to eat the right things to get my vitamins. I've always remembered that.": "Trinny",
  "When I'm out, maybe I'm looking at the fried chicken, but I know I need to order the grilled. But I'm still from the country. I love my fried food and my neck bones and all that, too.": "Adrian",

  "Yes, people need food and education. But one of the cornerstones of any society is a well-functioning legal system.": "Cherie",
  "For me, I love food. It's my greatest pleasure and also the thing that could ruin you as well. It's one of those things where, if you're not thoughtful about it, it could be unhealthy. But if there's a mindfulness about it; it actually is a wonderful tool of emotional expression.": "Jon",

  "When the woodpecker is searching for food, or laying siege to some hidden grub, the sound of his hammer is dead or muffled and is heard but a few yards. It is only upon dry, seasoned timber, freed of its bark, that he beats his reveille to spring and wooes his mate.": "John",

  "An adult human can last 40 days without food, a week without any sleep, three days without water, but only five minutes without air. Yet nothing is more taken for granted than the air we breathe. However, not just any air will do - it must be exquisitely designed to meet our needs. Too little oxygen in the atmosphere will kill us, as will too much.": "Hugh",
  "Ironically, when I was in Dubai with the BBC 'Good Food Show,' even though it's an urban area, when you see the vast panorama from the top of the Burj Khalifa, it feels remote, as if it's just sprung up out of the desert.

  "I eat soup noodles for comfort. In fact, noodles of any kind. It's a food that is very easy to eat; it's very soothing and comfortable, too. If I could choose any, I'd say buckwheat was my favourite: it has a very good flavour and is healthy, too.": "Nobu",

  "Yom Kippur, the Day of Atonement, is the holy of holies of Jewish time. It is that rarest of phenomena, a Jewish festival without food. Instead it is a day of fasting and prayer, introspection and self-judgment when, collectively and repeatedly, we confess our sins and pray to be written into God's Book of Life.": "Jonathan",
  "I love the food in Thailand because of the exotic spices they use. Their style of cooking is unique to their culture and always amazing.": "Venus",

  "It seems strange that bears, so fond of all sorts of flesh, running the risks of guns and fires and poison, should never attack men except in defense of their young. How easily and safely a bear could pick us up as we lie asleep! Only wolves and tigers seem to have learned to hunt man for food, and perhaps sharks and crocodiles.": "John",
  "There are certain comforts of living here in Dubai, the comforts of so many mosques and so much good food... It's just that much more secure. And may God keep it safe.": "Cat",

  "I'm a very, very healthy eater. I eat lots of fish, lots of vegetables, lots of fruit. I don't eat junk food.": "Victoria",
  "Unlike the primate hand, the elephant's grasping organ is also its nose. Elephants use their trunks not only to reach food but also to sniff and touch it. With their unparalleled sense of smell, the animals know exactly what they are going for. Vision is secondary.": "Frans",
  "I follow my own advice: eat less, move more, eat lots of fruits, vegetables, and grains, and don't eat too much junk food. It leaves plenty of flexibility for eating an occasional junk food.": "Marion",

  "'The Others' books take place in an alternate Earth where the Earth natives have been the dominant predators throughout the world's history, and humans are nowhere near the top of the food chain. But humans are clever and resilient, if not always wise, and have made some bargains with the Others in order to survive.": "Anne",
  "Fast food chains spend a large amount of marketing to get the attention of children. People form their eating habits as children so they try to nurture clients as youngsters.": "Eric",
  "One man's trash is another man's treasure, and the by-product from one food can be perfect for making another.": "Yotam",
  "If the people use the wealth bestowed on them by God for themselves alone or for treasuring it, it is like a corpse. But if they decide to share it with others, it becomes sacred food.": "Guru",
  "In a drama of the highest order there is little food for censure or hatred it teaches rather self-knowledge and self-respect.": "Percy",
  "You know you poor when you eatin' breakfast food late. You fryin' toast? At nine o'clock at night? With bacon? You're broke.": "Bernie",
  "The easiest diet is, you know, eat vegetables, eat fresh food. Just a really sensible healthy diet like you read about all the time.": "Drew",
  "It was interesting to think that the very first liquid ever poured on the Moon, and the first food eaten there, were communion elements.": "Buzz",
  "Part of the secret of a success in life is to eat what you like and let the food fight it out inside.": "Mark",
  "I've been on a team that won the world championship of barbecue. But barbecue's interesting, because it's one of these cult foods like chili, or bouillabaisse. Various parts of the world will have a cult food that people get enormously attached to - there's tremendous traditions; there's secrecy.": "Nathan",
  "Scotch beef, salmon and shellfish are recognised the world over for their excellence and Scottish provenance. People recognise the Scottish brand. They associate the country with quality food and drink, and clearly other Scottish sectors, such as dairy, can benefit from that, too.": "Nicola",
  "I am not a great cook, I am not a great artist, but I love art, and I love food, so I am the perfect traveller.": "Michael",
  "I did a dance sequence in my second short film, which was my best short film, called 'Hairway to the Stars,' and I think Chris Wink, the founder of Blue Man Group, was in that. It's a black-and-white dance sequence. We were Glorious Food waiters together.": "David",
  "We've gotten so far away from our food source. It's been hijacked from us. But if you get soil, plant something in it and water it, you can feed yourself. It's that simple.": "Ron",
  "I'm very proud of the Rome episode of 'No Reservations' because it violated all the conventional wisdom about making television. You're never, ever supposed to do a food or travel show in black and white.": "Anthony",
  "When I feel stressed, I turn to food for comfort, but I don't like to diet and I'm not good at it.": "Salma",
  "Because of media hype and woefully inadequate information, too many people nowadays are deathly afraid of their food, and what does fear of food do to the digestive system? I am sure that an unhappy or suspicious stomach, constricted and uneasy with worry, cannot digest properly.": "Julia",
  "One way to find food for thought is to use the fork in the road, the bifurcation that marks the place of emergence in which a new line of development begins to branch off.": "William",
  "I always made my food congenial to my constitution, and my health was always excellent.": "Giacomo",
  "On this National Agriculture Day, when we all should be taking time to thank and pay tribute to America's farmers, ranchers and their families who produce the food for our tables, we are finding those same people in dire need of our help and support.": "Michael",
  "I like putting my money into things like food and shelter. I'm probably a bad example of an investor.": "Simon",
  "I remember once in junior high school, on a Friday, my mom came home from work and said to my brother and I, 'You know, between us, we have only 27 cents, but we have food in the refrigerator, we have our little garden out back, and we're happy, so we are rich.'": "John",
  "I live a healthy lifestyle and I crave healthy food. I love porridge - I have bizarre cravings for it. I love it with brown sugar and bananas, and I'm a huge fan of cinnamon - I put cinnamon on everything. I also have a sweet tooth and I don't like to deprive myself. I think everything in moderation is the key.": "Jessica",
  "The traditional family table is round. No corners. No sides. No head. No tail. Everything is smooth. The food is in the center, and each family member reaches over the same distance. Someone you love is next to you on each side, and no one is last or at the end. The person farthest away from you is also the person facing you.": "Deng",
  "Food for us comes from our relatives, whether they have wings or fins or roots. That is how we consider food. Food has a culture. It has a history. It has a story. It has relationships.": "Winona",
  "Chefs are at the end of a long chain of individuals who work hard to feed people. Farmers, beekeepers, bakers, scientists, fishermen, grocers, we are all part of that chain, all food people, all dedicated to feeding the world.": "Jose",
  "If I have one addiction in life, it's probably food.": "Liam",
  "Growing up the way I grew up, food was scarce. So when you had an opportunity to eat, you ate. When I graduated from high school and went to college, I weighed 160 pounds. So, I knew I had to put on the weight. I ate everything from fried food to fried chicken wings. When I came to Green Bay, I did the same thing because I was 172 pounds.": "Donald",
  "I don't eat a lot of junk food anymore, but I sure remember it. I used to go through boxes of Little Debbies. I liked Star Crunch, and of course those oatmeal pies.": "CeeLo",
  "Tell me what you do with the food you eat, and I'll tell you who you are. Some turn their food into fat and manure, some into work and good humour, and others, I'm told, into God. So there must be three sorts of men.": "Nikos",
  "Man seems to be the only animal whose food soils him, making necessary much washing and shield-like bibs and napkins. Moles living in the earth and eating slimy worms are yet as clean as seals or fishes, whose lives are one perpetual wash.": "John",
  "I am naturally slim, actually thin. So, for years I have been trying to get some curves. I tried eating food that would increase my weight, but I only ended up putting fat around my stomach. So, now I have made peace with my body.": "Kangana",
  "I'd love for mental illness to be seen in the way that other horrible illnesses are. When people get cancer, very few parents will say, 'Oh I feel so bad for giving you so much unhealthy food over the years.'": "Matt",
  "Poverty is relative, and the lack of food and of the necessities of life is not necessarily a hardship. Spiritual and social ostracism, the invasion of your privacy, are what constitute the pain of poverty.": "Alice",
  "Families are struggling against a tide of junk information on junk food.": "Diane",
  "I'm not a machine. I get really motivated, then I fall off the wagon and want to eat Chinese food and sit on my couch and gain five or 10 pounds!": "Shemar",
  "America is a country of abundance, but our food culture is sad - based on huge portions and fast food. Let's stop with the excuses and start creating something better.": "David",
  "Fixing obesity is going to require a change in our modern relationship with food. I'm hopeful that we begin to see a turnaround in this childhood obesity epidemic.": "S.",
  "I think that any business that thinks that the transaction is 'you give me money and I give you food, next, you give me money and I give you food, next,' without understanding that people deeply want to feel restored is in danger.": "Danny",
  "Our lives are not in the lap of the gods, but in the lap of our cooks.": "Lin",
  "When I eat with my friends, it is a moment of real pleasure, when I really enjoy my life.": "Monica",
  "I tried to bake a cake for my mother's birthday - it took me four hours. It was terrible, and I cried for three days.": "Rachael",
  "Many rock musicians are excellent cooks, I've found, and those that are prefer to eat their own cooking in the studio. I encourage this behavior as I also enjoy the benefits of fresh food.": "Steve",
  "When I got to France I realized I didn't know very much about food at all. I'd never had a real cake. I'd had those cakes from cake mixes or the ones that have a lot of baking powder in them. A really good French cake doesn't have anything like that in it - it's all egg power.": "Julia",
  "From the simple stringing together of lemon garlands for the goddess Durga, to dividing the prasadam or blessed foods for the children first, I came to associate food not only with feminity, but also with purity and divinity.": "Padma",
  "Being a vegan is pretty easy these days, as almost every town and city has health food stores and vegetarian-friendly restaurants.": "Moby",
  "I believe that you can, by taking some simple and inexpensive measures, lead a longer life and extend your years of well-being. My most important recommendation is that you take vitamins every day in optimum amounts to supplement the vitamins that you receive in your food.": "Linus",
  "The biggest thing you can do is understand that every time you're going to the grocery store, you're voting with your dollars. Support your farmers' market. Support local food. Really learn to cook.": "Alice",
  "I cook a lot of Italian food. Bucatini Pomodoro is my best: it's a fat spaghetti with tomato, olive oil, and reminds me of getting married in Italy.": "Bill",
  "I turned into a monk when my mother went to learn Buddhism in Burma. While she learnt at the monastery, I used to roam around with a begging bowl and ask for food.": "Kabir",
  "I genuinely enjoy the process of making colourful, delicious food. But I do allow myself an occasional piece of chocolate - today I had a pastry. If I fancy something, I'll have it.": "Victoria",
  "Species co-evolve with the other species they eat, and very often, a relationship of interdependence develops: I'll feed you if you spread around my genes. A gradual process of mutual adaptation transforms something like an apple or a squash into a nutritious and tasty food for a hungry animal.": "Michael",
  "Mankind: A quality of life upgrade is available to each and every one of you. It should give you a quality of life upgrade, which means no drugs, no alcohol, no fast food - unless, of course, it's a mallard.": "Ted",
  "Put your nose into the Bible everyday. It is your spiritual food. And then share it. Make a vow not to be a lukewarm Christian.": "Kirk",
  "Each of us needs something - food, liquor, pot, whatever - to help us survive. Dracula needs blood.": "Frank",
  "If I agree to dispose of any part of our land to the white people I would feel guilty of taking food away from our children's mouths, and I do not wish to be that mean.": "Sitting",
  "At home I serve the kind of food I know the story behind.": "Michael",
  "It is easier to have faith that God will support each House of Hospitality and Farming Commune and supply our needs in the way of food and money to pay bills, than it is to keep a strong, hearty, living faith in each individual around us - to see Christ in him.": "Dorothy",
  "The highlight of my childhood was making my brother laugh so hard that food came out of his nose.": "Garrison",
  "About 20 per cent of the population believe themselves to have a food allergy and only about five per cent actually do.": "John",
  "I don't need the fillers, additives, excessive amounts of sugars, fats, salts and other measures taken to taint the natural goodness of real food.": "Mark",
  "I spent a college semester in a small town in Italy - and that is where I truly tasted food for the first time.": "Alton",
  "We the chefs have a responsibility to learn about the chemical makeup of food!": "Joel",
  "Now listen, the one thing about agriculture is we've lost our manufacturing, we've lost a great deal of jobs overseas, lots of our industry. The last thing in the world we need to do is lose the ability to produce our food.": "John",
  "Doing things like playing music, something that's so natural and basic to human function, running around in nature, eating delicious food. These things are intrinsic in basic, primordial to human beings, so that's sort of a way to return to a blank canvas, allowing my true personality to return.": "Ezra",
  "I'm a little self-conscious about my body. I love to wear hoodies because you can get cozy and eat some food and your belly doesn't show!": "Jared",
  "Our livelihood is intimately tied to the food we eat, water we drink and places where we recreate. That's why we have to promote responsibility and conservation when it comes to our natural resources.": "Mark",
  "I understand human needs. I grew up where far too many people lived day to day without elemental needs like food and shelter.": "Naveen",
  "Basically I'm a female human being with brown hair, enjoy precision, reading the news, eating delicious food with my delicious friends and laughing at ridiculous things that don't translate while you are desperately trying to make them.": "Tig",
  "The way I see it, love is an amusement park, and food its souvenir.": "Stephanie",
  "I'm all in favor of animal rights, but I'd like to see the food movement take a much stronger stand in defense of basic human rights. If you're a vegan or a vegetarian, you should care about the people who are picking your fruits and vegetables by hand.": "Eric",
  "As a diabetic, I'm a walking picnic. I have to eat measured amounts of food at certain times.": "Elaine",
  "People in my neighborhood are so disconnected from the fresh food supply that kids don't know an eggplant from a sweet potato. We have to show them how to get grounded in the truest sense of the word.": "Ron",
  "Jiro Ono serves Edo-style traditional sushi, the same 20 or 30 pieces he's been making his whole life, and he's still unsatisfied with the quality and every day wakes up and trains to make the best. And that is as close to a religious experience in food as one is likely to get.": "Anthony",
  "Yoga is the most boring exercise. It's for people who are too lazy to get on the elliptical. Bikram, where they heat up the room to mimic India's climate, is especially stupid. People in India are not skinny because they're doing yoga in 105-degree rooms; they're skinny because there's no food.": "Noureen",
  "I love the food, the girls, the sky and everything that is Delhi. I have very fond memories of the Moolchand flyover.": "Vir",
  "The food and drink that goes along with football is one of the best things: hamburgers, hotdogs, chips and dips. At the stadium I would probably get nachos, but when I'm at home we order pizza a lot.": "Marisa",
  "Pasta isn't just for Italian food anymore. Now there are tasty pasta recipes found in Asian cuisine, and it's emerging as a newfound love for vegans.": "Marcus",
  "In Italy, food is an expression of love. It is how you show those around you that you care for them. Having a love for food means you also have a love for those you are preparing it for and for yourself.": "Joe",
  "Create a garden; bring children to farms for field trips. I think it's important that parents and teachers get together to do one or two things they can accomplish well - a teaching garden, connecting with farms nearby, weave food into the curriculum.": "Alice",
  "I came to all the realizations about sustainability and biodiversity because I fell in love with the way food tastes. That was it. And because I was looking for that taste I feel at the doorsteps of the organic, local, sustainable farmers, dairy people and fisherman.": "Alice",
  "Social Security is based on a principle. It's based on the principle that you care about other people. You care whether the widow across town, a disabled widow, is going to be able to have food to eat.": "Noam",
  "If you maintain a healthy diet, or at least are smart about your food choices, you'll still see the pounds come off.": "Misty",
  "I'm from Canada, so Thanksgiving to me is just Thursday with more food. And I'm thankful for that.": "Howie",
  "In the Seventies, my children played in the street, read politically incorrect stories, ate home-cooked food and occasional junk and, yes, were sometimes smacked.": "Laurie",
  "Food is about communal togetherness. Our family does sit at the table. I think it's a great tragedy if a family doesn't have a table, as there is such an atmosphere of good will and warmth when we have eight people sitting around it.": "Jonathan",
  "Sure, I like ice cream, but when you keep a healthy lifestyle, it's: Do you prefer sweets and crappy food, or do you prefer to have a nice body? It depends on what you want more.": "Tim",
  "What I miss most about Mexico isn't the food or the customs it's my family and the way we'd all sit around chatting together.": "Javier",
  "Let's face it: my life tends to revolve around food, and I love feeding people.": "Ruth",
  "Barbecue is the good old technique of people making a fire and putting some stuff over the top - I mean, look at the S'more: it's just got a stick. A lot of those goofy toys, it's people who are looking at things to do. I think if you focus on the food, at the most you need tongs or a spoon to flip something; that's about it.": "Graham",
  "The eligibility for food stamps has widened and widened welfare has been widened - unemployment insurance and disability insurance. These are all incentives not to work.": "Lawrence",
  "I was one of the first six black kids to integrate a formerly all-white school. I remember being looked at all the time and people laughing at my hair. I was also very self-conscious about the food I had for lunch. I had egg sandwiches, and the other mothers gave kids fancy stuff like bologna and Marmite. It took about a year to settle in.": "Petina",
  "I'm into the food in Vegas. I'm willing to go to nice restaurants for sushi and stuff like that.": "Britney",
  "I know how I like my food. I like it spicy, salty, sticky, crunchy, juicy, oozy - basically any dish you know and love, jacked up to a bordering-on-socially-unacceptable amount of flavor.": "Chrissy",
  "I can be a romantic. The way to every woman's heart is through her stomach. Food is at the core of everything.": "Paul",
  "I do like going out and finding free food. I've done it since I was a child. Fishing prawns and shrimps from the sea is wonderful, as is picking blackberries, sloes and mushrooms. Having a guide while out looking for mushrooms is really important, though, as picking the wrong type can be quite dangerous.": "Mary",
  "Taste as you go. When you taste the food throughout the cooking process you can make adjustments as you go.": "Anne",
  "I said to my friends that if I was going to starve, I might as well starve where the food is good.": "Virgil",
  "I haven't eaten at a McDonald's since I became President.": "William",
  "When fast food is not a treat but a dietary staple, the children surf the internet all day in dark corners of the room and are bombarded with latest gadgets. Things replace parental standards.": "Diane",
  "I love food, all types of food. I love Korean food, Japanese, Italian, French. In Australia, we don't have a distinctive Australian food, so we have food from everywhere all around the world. We're very multicultural, so we grew up with lots of different types of food.": "Hugh",
  "I love chicken fingers, I love French fries. I love desserts. I'm not just into dessert or just into savoury food. I love it all. I'm a pig. I love food. So it takes a lot of discipline to eat healthy.": "Holly",
  "As a matter of fact, most cases of food poisoning are never linked back to their source.": "Eric",
  "I drive a hybrid, moving into an electric car. I only drink tap water, never consume food that's travelled.": "Nassim",
  "I think about food literally all day every day. It's a thing.": "Taylor",
  "I want to spend my life with someone and do nice things and go on adventures, read books and have nice food and celebrate things. I don't want to spend the rest of my life in the bedroom like some people who just go to bed and never get out again.": "Tracey",
  "According to my mother, there pretty much wasn't anything I wouldn't eat as a child. Not just try, but eat. I was even inclined to dig into stuff about which she expressed open disgust - lobster and other shellfish, and cheap Chinese food with pepper so hot it made your gums feel like a medieval dentist had been at them.": "Alice",
  "Great wine is always enhanced by great food.": "Kenneth",
  "There's great food everywhere, and even McDonald's uses nice wood now.": "Spike",
  "You can't make a souffle rise twice.": "Alice",

  "Animals are my friends... and I don't eat my friends.": "George",
  "Real nutrition comes from soybeans, almonds, rice, and other healthy vegetable sources, not from a cow's udder.": "Ingrid",

  "It's difficult to believe that people are still starving in this country because food isn't available.": "Ronald",
  "If you want to eat well in England, eat three breakfasts.": "W.",
  "I do love Italian food. Any kind of pasta or pizza. My new pig out food is Indian food. I eat Indian food like three times a week. It's so good.": "Jennifer",
  "Food is your body's fuel. Without fuel, your body wants to shut down.": "Ken",
  "As I see it, a green salad is an open invitation to carrots, onions, mushrooms, tomatoes, and the sprouts that grow in jars on my kitchen counter.": "Victoria",
  "You can do good work simply staying up all night and eating nothing but junk food, but probably not in the long term.": "John",
  "He looked about as inconspicuous as a tarantula on a slice of angel food.": "Raymond",
  "I was eating bad stuff. Lots of sugar and carbs, junk food all the time. It makes you very irritated.": "Avril",
  "My sisters like cooking at my place. It has a bit more room, and the food tastes a little bit better. A big pot of spaghetti and sauce, some warm French bread - works all the time. I think I've been eating pasta for 26 years.": "Tom",
  "I love good food but I follow strict rules the days I perform.": "Jose",
  "The wonderful thing about Food for Thought is that it lets you keep your hand in theater and be in front of a live audience without a commitment of six months, or even three months.": "Treat",
  "Food safety involves everybody in the food chain.": "Mike",
  "A lot of food shows need only to tempt. Some food shows only need to inspire, to empower. And there are a lot of shows that do that.": "Alton",
  "There are apothecaries' shops, where prepared medicines, liquids, ointments, and plasters are sold; barbers' shops, where they wash and shave the head; and restaurateurs, that furnish food and drink at a certain price.": "Hernan",
  "I want to make wines that harmonize with food - wines that almost hug your tongue with gentleness.": "Robert",
  "We can no more do without spirituality than we can do without food, shelter, or clothing.": "Ernest",
  "In corn, I think I've found the key to the American food chain. If you look at a fast-food meal, a McDonald's meal, virtually all the carbon in it - and what we eat is mostly carbon - comes from corn.": "Michael",
  "My work has also motivated me to put a lot of time into seeking out good food and to spend more money on it.": "Michael",
  "In addition to contributing to erosion, pollution, food poisoning, and the dead zone, corn requires huge amounts of fossil fuel - it takes a half gallon of fossil fuel to produce a bushel of corn.": "Michael",
  "I'd like to be rich. I'd like a lot of money to put into my physicals and to buy food for all my friends.": "Syd",
  "Contaminated food is a major cause of diarrhea, substantially contributing to malnutrition and killing about 2.2 million people each year, most of them children.": "Gro",
  "Italy in the first years got food, for the first year or the first periods got food. Then we got raw materials and then we got tool machines, let's say, instruments for working.": "Gianni",
  "The two things that could have been better is number one, to get major military force into the community almost immediately to make sure that there was law and order. Number two, we had enough helicopters to airlift food into the centers of population and those places.": "Warren",
  "If a State has reliable scientific information that demonstrates that a warning is needed for a particular food, then in the interest of public health, it should share that information with the FDA and petition for a new national standard.": "Nathan",
  "I don't try to match wine with food, I just drink what I like. And I think a lot of people are going towards that now, which never used to be in the past.": "Mario",
  "But I don't begrudge anybody, because I know how hard it is to have that dream and to make it happen, whether or not it's just to put a roof over your head and food on the table.": "Carol",
  "Man's survival, from the time of Adam and Eve until the invention of agriculture, must have been precarious because of his inability to ensure his food supply.": "Norman",

  "You don't have to live in the country and grow your own food to be green.": "Shalom",
  "Ever since Eve started it all by offering Adam the apple, woman's punishment has been to supply a man with food then suffer the consequences when it disagrees with him.": "Helen",
  "I recycle. I have a house in the south of France and I have a small garden. My name is Dujardin - 'from the garden.' I grow carrots, peppers, strawberries, green beans, and things for salads, but there are lots of wild boars all around and they steal the food.": "Jean",
  "Most schools have only a microwave or deep fryer, hardly the tools needed to feed our children real, fresh food.": "Mark",
  "When it becomes a revolutionary act to eat real food, we are in trouble.": "Mark",
  "Long as I was riding in a big Cadillac and dressed nice and had plenty of food, that's all I cared about.": "Etta",
  "My husband cooks fancier food for himself than I've ever cooked on-air. I call him from the road, and he's making champagne-vanilla salmon or black-cherry pork chop. Half of me is feeling unworthy. Not only am I not a chef, I'm not a better cook than my own husband!": "Rachael",
  "When I do a 30-minute meal, for instance, on Food Network, that's my food you see at the end of the show and it's not perfect. And if sometimes things break or drop or the pasta hits the wall when I'm draining it, they never stop tape. They just kind of let me go with it.": "Rachael",
  "The thing about all my food is that everything is a remembered flavor. Maybe it's something I had as a child or maybe it's something I had in Milan, but I want it to taste better than you ever thought.": "Ina",
  "You don't want flame to hit your food. Flame is bad. Flame does nasty things to food. It makes soot and it makes deposits of various chemicals that are not too good for us. The last thing you really want to see licking at your food while it's on a grill is an actual flame.": "Alton",
  "Most food you drop is still perfectly edible. If it was in your eyesight the whole time, you can pick it up and eat it.": "Mehmet",
  "Mexican food is far more varied than people think. It changes like dialects. I was brought up in Jalisco by the sea on a basic diet - tomatoes, chillis, peppers of every size and rice, which is a Mexican staple. The Pacific coast has a huge array of seafood.": "Gael",
  "I love spicy food.": "Cynthia",
  "Indian food has been huge in the UK forever and ever, but that's because it has a historical rooting. America, I think is really ripe for it. There's been so much interest in Indian culture.": "Aarti",
  "Latin food suffers like Chinese. You can do marginal Chinese and be successful. You can do crappy Mexican and be packed.": "Aaron",
  "It is great to add some glamour to the food industry, like television shows have done for the food world and inspiring people to work in the industry. The flip side of that is unfortunately people think that after they get their qualifications, they get their invitation to compete on 'Top Chef.'": "Curtis",
  "My goal in 'Live to Cook' is to make great food more approachable for home cooks.": "Michael",
  "When two kids are being completely berserk, and they're naked and throwing food around, sometimes I just let it go because I can see a future where they're going to be dressed, and they're going to be at school. So I kind of let stuff go sometimes.": "Louis",
  "Urban conservationists may feel entitled to be unconcerned about food production because they are not farmers. But they can't be let off so easily, for they are all farming by proxy.": "Wendell",
  "Canadians are very well behaved, they don't throw their food.": "Calvin",
  "If the first requisite for writing well about food is a good appetite, the second is to put in your apprenticeship as a feeder when you have enough money to pay the check but not enough to produce indifference of the total.": "A.",
  "Everyone would be healthier if they didn't eat junk food.": "Robert",
  "You think about some of the most memorable meals you've ever had; the food will be good but it will often be about locating a mental memory and taste is inexorably linked to all the other senses and memory, so ultimately it is all about taste.": "Heston",
  "Money spent on carbon cuts is money we can't use for effective investments in food aid, micronutrients, HIV/AIDS prevention, health and education infrastructure, and clean water and sanitation.": "Bjorn",
  "Fashion, for me, is anything that's aesthetic and beautiful. Art, food, film. It's something that I appreciate and really like.": "St.",
  "I only like food without color, like potatoes, bread, and pasta.": "Emma",
  "The air that people breathe in many Chinese cities has become dangerously polluted. Their food supply is subject to constant contamination scandals. Now it appears that not merely stagnant ponds but the water people draw from deep underground is already tainted.": "James",
  "What's my favourite food? One you order out.": "Abigail",
  "I like a quiet evening with family or friends over, great food and great discussion and a lot of laughter. That's really what I think fills my tank.": "Anna",
  "Steakhouses sort of have this old-school nature to them they're like museums full of good food. It's fun hearing the waiter share his expertise on the different cuts of beef and how they're going to cut up your baked potato.": "Jim",
  "Life is a perspective and for me, if a human being has access to school, clean water, food, proper health care, that is the basis of human rights.": "Gelila",
  "All the food that is put into the stomach that the system cannot derive benefit from, is a burden to nature in her work.": "Ellen",
  "I will say that the food in both Japan and Italy was immaculate. I don't remember having bad food in either country.": "Daniel",
  "I love good food and I love to eat in nice restaurants. I love Japanese food. I love Gordon Ramsay in London he is pretty amazing.": "Isla",
  "All of us want to live, and that is absolutely natural. However, we should learn from childhood on to choose our best way to die. If we don't do that, we end up spending our days like a dog, only in search of harbour, food and expressing a blind loyalty to his owner in return. That isn't enough to make our lives have a meaning.": "Yamamoto",
  "There's no denying that candy is comfort food and it's affordable.": "Dylan",

  "The food I've liked in my time is American country cookin'.": "Colonel",
  "Chefs think about what it's like to make food. Being a scientist in the kitchen is about asking why something works, and how it works.": "Nathan",
  "Being a consultant is like flying first-class. The food is terrific, the drinks are cold. But all you can do is walk up to the pilot and say, 'bank left.' If you're in management, you have the controls.": "Greg",
  "I am terrible at making food. I love eating, but I can't make anything.": "Nicola",
  "I love spicy food, love it. But wasabi is just painful.": "Devon",
  "Modern agriculture has been accurately described as a way of turning oil into food. As the price of oil continues to rise, so will the price of food.": "Jeremy",
  "Variety is what I would recommend: As variety is the spice of life in food, so it is in exercise. Change it up. But most of all, don't overdo it.": "Martina",
  "I could never give up Mexican food. Nachos are usually my go-to if I'm courtside at an NBA game. I always, always get my picture taken with my mouth wide open and a tortilla chip sticking out of it!": "Eva",
  "Meals make the society, hold the fabric together in lots of ways that were charming and interesting and intoxicating to me. The perfect meal, or the best meals, occur in a context that frequently has very little to do with the food itself.": "Anthony",
  "As I see it, fast food outfits have targeted small children with their advertising in a very effective way. You know, it's clowns and kid's toys and bright colors and things like that.": "Anthony",
  "In general, the more food we eat in its natural state - without additives - and the less it is refined, the healthier it will be for us. Food can affect the mind, and deficiencies of certain elements in the body can promote mental depression.": "Ezra",
  "God created the universe in such a manner that all in common might derive their food from it, and that the Earth should also be a property common to all.": "Saint",
  "Eating together is the most intimate form of kinship. By scripting a work where we share the same kind of food with fish, I'm scripting our interrelationship with them.": "Natalie",
  "A good host is someone who really takes care of everyone, from the food to their daily programme. I can't.": "Christian",
  "Whatever your favorite food is, if you eat it every day for a month, you're going to get sick of it.": "Tucker",
  "What's the most humiliating thing? When you take someone to dinner or you cook somebody dinner and they get food poisoning. I mean, how bad do you feel?": "Wendi",
  "I'm big on tomato mozzarella salad. That's my favorite all-time food.": "Jan",
  "Two of the central ingredients to our family are food and faith, so sitting down together and thanking God for the food He's provided means everything to us. Prayer is a natural part of our lives - not only around the dinner table, but all day long.": "Phil",
  "I eat mostly organic, but I love macaroni and cheese, Mexican food, and egg-and-cheese croissants. So when I indulge, I eat protein and veggies for the rest of the day. It really is all about moderation and balance.": "Marisa",
  "Tacos are the perfect food.": "Sophia",
  "The smells of slow cooking spread around the house and impart a unique warmth matched only by the flavour of the food.": "Yotam",
  "How we grow food has enormous effects on the environment - climate change as well as pollution of air, water, and soil.": "Marion",
  "I am very much about promoting Lima because I think Peru and the mountains and the Incas, everybody is aware of those, but Lima is something that people should discover - especially our food.": "Mario",
  "Food is a lens for culture.": "Dana",
  "In the hands of food manufacturers, cheese has become an 'ingredient.'": "Michael",
  "I think the basic thing that home cooks can learn how to do is just season properly... If the home cook realized how little salt they use compared to what's needed, it would make their food taste better.": "David",
  "I talk to trees and animals. We have interesting conversations about food, weather, and love. They sometimes can predict the future.": "Shan",
  "If we want to improve American food and make it much cheaper, we should deregulate the food trucks and the other street vendors, provided they meet certain sanitation standards. Many cities have already moved down this path, and people are not keeling over with salmonella.": "Tyler",
  "Vietnamese food has probably been saved from the mass market because most people never master the sauces and condiments that must be added to the food, at the table, for its glories to become apparent. It's too much trouble, and a lot of people don't like asking for help, especially if the interaction involves some linguistic awkwardness.": "Tyler",
  "I have a great love for cuisine, so I'm always interested in local food, and there are so many interesting dishes, spices and ingredients in India.": "Romain",

  "The Project Angel Food Program's mission is to nourish the body and spirit of men, women and children affected by HIV/AIDS and other serious illness. The Project Angel Food Program delivers free and nutritious meals prepared with love. We act out of a sense of urgency because hunger and illness cannot wait.": "Marianne",
  "Your relationship to food is but a reflection of your relationship to yourself, as is everything in your life.": "Marianne",
  "It was gross enough for fast food restaurants to ban, but apparently our government wants so-called pink slime to be a staple in your kids' lunches.": "Jane",
  "I think people are transient. Back in the early church, there was a 'stick and stay' mentality. In this day and time, people have a fast food mentality of ministry. If it doesn't fit them or if it doesn't fit in their schedule, they'll move on to something else. That's a norm in today's time.": "Marvin",
  "I had barely turned 12 when my parents packed me off to Doon School. I was transported to a world of confusion with 600 other kids, no home-cooked food, no made-to-order clothes. It was a shock, but I adjusted.": "Jyotiraditya",
  "The people who misuse the Sabbath lose the blessings of spiritual food and growth promised to those who keep this commandment.": "Joseph",
  "Priesthood quorums teach and assist their members to attain good health, financial stability, and a year's supply of food and clothing. They also teach their members to be self-reliant and to give their time, talents, and means in behalf of the Church, community, and needy.": "Joseph",
  "When my family did shy away from Indian food, we'd eat a lot of Chinese. We'd use the wok a lot. I never had a problem with Brussels sprouts or broccoli growing up. I always grew up with the mentality of finishing your plate.": "Parvesh",
  "I was afraid of Korean food when I moved to L.A., let alone sushi. I remember thinking either sink or swim. Living here in Studio City, Ventura Blvd. is the Mecca of sushi restaurants. What you thought was so exotic is just run of the mill.": "Parvesh",
  "As a chef and father, it kills me that children are fed processed foods, fast food clones, foods loaded with preservatives and high-fructose corn syrup.": "Jose",
  "I was always with a single mom, and we never had schedules or anything. We were just Bohemian, us against the world, which was kind of great, but it certainly didn't breed security. I've gotten hyper-sensitive to schedules and bath time and eating at the dinner table. We don't just 'Bohemian' go out at nine o'clock and go get Chinese food.": "Brooke",
  "I love Mexican food, and there's a really good restaurant called El Parador that I love.": "Jacquelyn",
  "I love food. I'm a huge food addict. I think in my past life I was a pig or something like that, but I love eating; I never stop eating.": "Justin",
  "Eating disorders are usually nothing to do with food. Parents need to be with their child to see them through it. All the therapists in the world can't help if the parents aren't present, loving, and proactive.": "Olivia",
  "Yeah, I'm a vegetarian - but still, some things are just nasty. I like salads. But sometimes, they get too creative. I like regular food, just no meat in it.": "Prince",
  "The Travel Channel had success with their 'Food Paradise' series, '10 Best Places to Pig Out' and those types of specials, so they knew there was a market for comfort food and wanted to develop a show around it.": "Adam",
  "I read somewhere that abs are made in the kitchen, and I'd like to agree. I like to think that I try to eat pretty clean, pretty good food.": "Parker",
  "At school, I was brought up on revolting food - sausages, sausages and Spam - but at home, I had the most wonderful sponge puddings, which I don't indulge in very often now.": "David",
  "I only get fat when I eat food cooked by other chefs. At home, my wife does all the cooking. She makes simple things like soups and salads. We both like steamed tofu.": "Alain",
  "If you can't afford organic food and are unable to grow your own, it's crucial to wash all inorganic produce very carefully to minimize the toxins you consume. Soak everything for 20 minutes in water with vinegar and salt or water with fresh lemon juice and salt.": "Suzanne",
  "Anyone, any type of story, it doesn't have to be a crime victim, you don't have to let yourself be food for the media.": "Bernhard",
  "The most appealing thing to me about food is combining and layering flavors, tastes, and textures. So the perfect sandwich has to be toasted. It has to have Emmenthal Swiss cheese and a combination of sweet and savory - some cranberry or fig thing happening - with different kinds of meats like Black Forest ham and roast beef.": "Kyle",
  "There's a song called 'Live Blogging the Himmel Family Bris.' I kind of went for it here in terms of - it was really fun to be explaining ritual circumcision in Nashville - a lot of brises are done in hospitals, but many are done in people's homes, and there's a lot of food, and a lot of leftovers.": "Rick",
  "There was a Gallup poll that said something like 70 percent of people in the United States do not enjoy their job - they work to put food on the table and get insurance to survive. So, what happens when technology can do all that work for us and allow us to actually do what we enjoy with our time?": "Peter",
  "Animals used for food are treated like unfeeling machinery.": "Peter",
  "Something I learned when I was very young: with cooking, it doesn't matter where you are; you can always cook. You can end up in small village in Peru where somebody's cooking, take a spoon and taste it, and you might not be too sure what you're eating, but you can taste the soul in the food. That's what is beautiful with food.": "Daniel",
  "People need to eat whole food plant foods, primarily... whole grains, fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds. That diet supports our lives. We ought to live to be 90 or 100 without getting any diseases.": "John",
  "The people are more important than the food. We want a person to be as successful as he can be, and it works the other way around, too.": "S.",
  "Writing about food is my default.": "Ruth",
  "The implications of Americans devoting their lives to fast food are more profound than the fact that our kids aren't eating well. There are real repercussions that we need to know about and think about.": "Ruth",
  "If we make it national policy that we will support small farmers the way we support agribusiness, we'll suddenly see it change in terms of the cost of organic food.": "Ruth",
  "All developmental activities for the common man such as education, healthcare, shelter and food distribution should be handled by reputed private sector institutions. It should be a competitive market in order to prevent the formation of monopolies.": "N.",
  "Six months after we started, in 1964, there was a day when we sold only seven sandwiches. If we'd taken all the money from the register, we couldn't have paid an employee, much less the food or the rent or all that. It could have been a turning point. We could have given up.": "Fred",
  "My mother never met a gadget she didn't like. There were tube pans for baking the angel food cakes my father could have after his first heart attack, and Bundt pans and loaf pans and baking pans and grilling pans.": "Janet",
  "There's a certain time of day after sunset when people naturally seem to feel the urge to gather by a fire or a stove or a hibachi or another common source of heat and food, and hunker down together to eat and drink. Call it the blue hour.": "Kate",
  "Thin people release the fork, and they chew the food with the fork on the table. They chew their food slowly. They look around at each other or the wall or a picture. They listen to the music. They sit back and take a breath. They do something other than concentrate on shoving the food into their body.": "Jean",
  "Clean water is a great example of something that depends on energy. And if you solve the water problem, you solve the food problem.": "Richard",
  "Food is celebratory. People who don't cook don't know how much fun they're missing.": "Leo",
  "There are eight or nine leading varieties of rice grown in Japan, all of which, except an upland species, require mud, water, and much puddling and nasty work. Rice is the staple food and the wealth of Japan. Its revenues were estimated in rice. Rice is grown almost wherever irrigation is possible.": "Isabella",
  "Popeye was right about spinach: dark green, leafy vegetables are the healthiest food on the planet. As whole foods go, they offer the most nutrition per calorie.": "Michael",
  "We have more tools at hand, literally, to make life easier and more productive than ever. We have Google, Wikipedia, iPads, iPhones, iTunes, YouTube, Netflix, and 600 cable channels. We can shop, pay bills, order food, and get nearly everything delivered, all of it with the touch of a finger on a device in the palm of our hand.": "Mike",
  "When I was growing up on our 53-acre dairy farm, we were obsessed with food; it was the center of our lives. We planted it, grew it, harvested it, peeled it, cooked it, served it, consumed it - endlessly, day after day, season after season.": "Bobbie",
  "The animal world seizes its food in masses little and big, and often gorges itself with it, but the vegetable, through the agency of the solvent power of water, absorbs its nourishment molecule by molecule.": "John",
  "The Horny Toad in Cave Creek has great food. When I'm in Arizona, I have at least one meal there. I have a daughter who lives out there, and Dee Dee Wood, who was the choreographer on 'Mary Poppins,' lives out there. I still get out there once in a while, but not in the summer.": "Dick",
  "Food plays a large part in our weekend, but on a Friday evening, I'll make us something simple for tea. I might have a wee glass of wine.": "Victoria",
  "As the graying of the country continues its march forward, many retirees are now relocating to dense urban centers for the cultural and social opportunities, access to public transportation, and the ability to shop nearby for food and household needs without depending unduly on others.": "Chuck",
  "Eat food. Not too much. Mostly plants. That, more or less, is the short answer to the supposedly incredibly complicated and confusing question of what we humans should eat in order to be maximally healthy.": "Michael",
  "The astounding variety of foods on offer in the modern supermarket obscures the fact that the actual number of species in the modern diet is shrinking. For reasons of economics, the food industry prefers to tease its myriad processed offerings from a tiny group of plant species, corn and soybeans chief among them.": "Michael",
  "There's tons of junk food for your mind on the Internet. You can sit there for three or 10 or 20 hours a day getting in online arguments with other people who also choose to waste their time.": "Henry",
  "I know it's not cat food, but what exactly is it that they put inside of tinned ravioli?": "Douglas",
  "I'm pro-forwards. Do I want the Seventies to come back? No. The haircuts were terrible. Everyone stank. The food was awful.": "Douglas",
  "Real food, I've found, is actually better than dieting.": "Angelina",
  "I always preferred my father's pasta the next day, when he'd put it in a hot oven with heaps of extra cheese. It would emerge slightly burned and very crisp on top.": "Yotam",
  "An almost forgotten means of economic self-reliance is the home production of food. We are too accustomed to going to stores and purchasing what we need.": "Ezra",
  "There are blessings in being close to the soil, in raising your own food even if it is only a garden in your yard and a fruit tree or two. Those families will be fortunate who, in the last days, have an adequate supply of food because of their foresight and ability to produce their own.": "Ezra",
  "I love food and feel that it is something that should be enjoyed. I eat whatever I want. I just don't overeat.": "Tyra",
  "I love all kinds of bread. Whenever I crave junk food, I want salty things like peanuts or potato chips.": "Tyra",
  "Neighborhoods and communities are complex organisms that will be resilient only if they are healthy along a number of interrelated dimensions, much as a human body cannot be healthy without adequate air, water, rest, and food.": "Ben",
  "Is Elizabeth Taylor fat? Her favorite food is seconds.": "Joan",
  "The secret of food lies in memory - of thinking and then knowing what the taste of cinnamon or steak is.": "Jerry",
  "Like all food, whether you're talking about Persian food, or Chinese food, or Swedish food, it's always a reflection of wars, trading, a bunch of good and a bunch of bad. But what's left is always the food story.": "Marcus",
  "The reasons for food insecurity are many and varied. But part of the problem is the global farming systems.": "Marcus",
  "I had a long-lasting love affair with the flavors from Japan and the hustling New York street vendors. And, of course, a life-changing return to Ethiopia has made huge impacts on my life in food.": "Marcus",
  "I'm frugal. I'm not a very acquisitive woman. I never waste food. If you prepare your own food, you engage with the world, it tastes alive. It tastes good.": "Vivienne",
  "I love food, and I'm a chronic over-orderer at restaurants.": "Shakira",
  "We take food for granted, but it isn't a luxury for many people.": "Christina",
  "The growth of the company and the license that Starbucks has is to participate in other food and beverage opportunities. We have a global business... and in many parts of the world, tea is much, much bigger than coffee, and we're going to bring tea and bring our capability and our understanding of what we've done for coffee to tea.": "Howard",
  "Being on food stamps can be demeaning. Cashiers know the difference between the new plastic SNAP cards and a credit card. Some food stamp recipients say some cashiers have made them feel uncomfortable and embarrassed.": "Donna",
  "Why not add benefits for making healthy food choices, provide a transition bonus for getting off food stamps, or increase job training opportunities and income - raising minimum wage?": "Donna",
  "A year after winning the Oscar, almost to the day, I was directing a dog food commercial.": "Peter",
  "The biggest and most deadly 'tax' rate on the poor comes from a loss of various welfare state benefits - food stamps, housing subsidies and the like - if their income goes up.": "Thomas",
  "When children are exposed to advertisements for unhealthy food, they will, in turn, consume significantly unhealthier rather than healthy calories as a result.": "Chuck",
  "Understand, when you eat meat, that something did die. You have an obligation to value it - not just the sirloin but also all those wonderful tough little bits.": "Anthony",
  "People in Slow Food understand that food is an environmental issue.": "Michael",
  "A program to make municipal composting of food and yard waste mandatory and then distributing the compost free to area farmers would shrink America's garbage heap, cut the need for irrigation and fossil-fuel fertilizers in agriculture, and improve the nutritional quality of the American diet.": "Michael",
  "French cooking is really the result of peasants figuring out how to extract flavor from pedestrian ingredients. So most of the food that we think of as elite didn't start out that way.": "Michael",
  "If we're eating industrially, if we're letting large corporations, fast food chains, cook our food, we're going to have a huge, industrialized, monoculture agriculture because big likes to buy from big. So I realized, wow, how we cook or whether we cook has a huge bearing on what kind of agriculture we're going to have.": "Michael",
  "The first step in reforming appetite is going from processed food to real food. Then, if you can afford organic or grass-fed, fantastic. But the first step is moving from processed industrial food to the real thing.": "Michael",
  "Barbecue is an incredibly democratic food. It's cheaper than McDonald's in many places and far more delicious. On the other hand, the only reason it can be that cheap is they use commodity hogs, the worst of the worst, which is - you know, it's an industry kind of ruining North Carolina.": "Michael",
  "I love oatmeal. To me, it's not boring. I agree that ordinary oatmeal is very boring, but not the steel-cut Irish kind - the kind that pops in your mouth when you bite into it in little glorious bursts like a sort of gummy champagne.": "Alan",
  "I'm just sick of food going in the garbage.": "Tom",
  "I love dogs. They live in the moment and don't care about anything except affection and food. They're loyal and happy. Humans are just too damn complicated.": "David",
  "All the time people ask me, like, 'Oh my God, what did you do to get ready for the red carpet?' And I'm like, 'I just had Thai food.' I love to work out and do cardio and have a healthy, active lifestyle, but I also am not going to, like, freak out over food.": "Ashley",
  "Children are amazingly adaptable. What would be grotesquely abnormal became my normality in the prisoner of war camps. It became routine for me to line up three times a day to eat lousy food in a noisy mess hall. It became normal for me to go with my father to bathe in a mass shower.": "George",
  "I only eat healthy food, and I only want healthy love!": "Jillian",
  "The physics of water is central to cooking, because food is mostly water. All steak that you cook is actually boiled on the inside.": "Nathan",
  "If you talk about sous-vide, then you have to talk about food safety, and microbiology, and heat.": "Nathan",
  "I always say, 'There's a difference between cooked food and McDonald's.' Your mom's homemade dinner - you enjoy this more than you enjoy the fast food that comes along and goes, and I strive to make homemade dinner every time I put out an album.": "Estelle",
  "When I started, you had cochineal food colouring that would turn things pink, but you could never make it red. Now, red is no problem - and if you look at supermarket bakery sections since 'Bake Off' began, you can get everything.": "Mary",
  "I love Michel Roux, Jr., and James Martin - the chefs who are experts in their own right, like Rick Stein on fish. But I don't watch them very much because I don't think it's fair for my husband to be in a total food environment all the time! So we watch programmes about gardening more.": "Mary",
  "The food that enters the mind must be watched as closely as the food that enters the body.": "Pat",
  "My favourite thing in the world is going out to get Chinese food, then coming home and renting a movie.": "Bindi",
  "The workers who harvest our food have been systematically denied the basic rights that are granted to all other American workers. They can be fired for trying to form a union or for attempting to improve their working conditions. They are not eligible for overtime pay, disability, or even unemployment insurance.": "Eric",
  "The best food is in Chicago. There are great restaurants everywhere, from fancy places to burger joints.": "Steve",
  "From cheesecake on a stick to meat skewers to deep-fried bananas on a stick - there are no plates anymore. In Los Angeles, everything has become a corn dog. Actually, corn dogs still work. But most other food should be stickless.": "Steve",
  "Why is it when we have a bad experience with a product, we assume it is us, but a bad experience with food, we blame the food?!": "Jonathan",
  "I like being able to walk into an old town and find good local food.": "Sienna",
  "Italy will always have the best food.": "Diane",
  "A poet could write volumes about diners, because they're so beautiful. They're brightly lit, with chrome and booths and Naugahyde and great waitresses. Now, it might not be so great in the health department, but I think diner food is really worth experiencing periodically.": "David",
  "Animals' taste systems are specialized for the niche they occupy in the environment. That includes us. As hunters and foragers of the dry savannah, our earliest forebears evolved a taste for important but scarce nutrients: salt and high-energy fats and sugars. That, in a nutshell, explains the widespread popularity of junk food.": "Mary",
  "My idea of good living is not about eating high on the hog. Rather, to me, good living means understanding how food connects us to the earth.": "Ruth",
  "If you go back in American history, oysters were the food of poor people. New York was filled with oyster saloons in the 1800s.": "Ruth",
  "Every two months, I allow myself a splurge day where I eat thick, doughy pizza from Pizzeria Uno or an ice cream sundae from my store with birthday-cake ice cream, Marshmallow Fluff, and toppings mixed in.": "Dylan",
  "We do take seriously our responsibility, and growing ability, to educate people about healthy eating and giving them greater access to nourishing and affordable fresh food.": "John",
  "In fact, in many ways my mother was quite hippy-dippy, serving macrobiotic food and reading 'Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance.'": "Kristin",
  "I like serving family-style or setting up a buffet. Everyone just goes to town, scoops their own food, and mixes their own drinks. You know how people love to come and watch you in the kitchen now and talk your ear off? If you give them something to do and something to drink, they don't do that as much.": "Chrissy",
  "Food isn't like anything else. It's something precious. It's not a commodity.": "Alice",
  "I really like having someone who knows about food and what goes well together make a meal for me.": "Alice",
  "My goal was to be able to be alone without food, sugar, phone, men, TV, anything and to feel O.K. about myself.": "Debbie",
  "I love food. I mean, I really love food. I take pictures of my finest, funniest and most fascinating dishes, post them on Twitter, and send them to friends. I treat menus like classic literature, refusing to skip even one word. I read the description of every item, regardless of whether or not I'm interested in eating it.": "Rachel",
  "The Middle East is ailing. The malady stems from pervasive violence, shortages of food, water and educational opportunities, discrimination against women and - the most virulent cause of all - the absence of freedom.": "Shimon",
  "At the end of the day, it seems like there's a critic archetype for food movies, like with 'Ratatouille' or anything. You know, if you were doing a puppet show about chefs, one puppet would be the chef, one would be the critic.": "Jon",
  "Know how to garnish food so that it is more appealing to the eye and even more flavorful than before.": "Marilyn",
  "Sardinia is beautiful. The people were so friendly, and the food was incredible! I also loved Florence. I spent two months there as part of a school study-abroad program. On the weekends, we would get to travel wherever we wanted, so I would explore. That was a magical time.": "Tia",
  "I am often asked the question: 'What is your favorite type of food?' Although I always answer Japanese, the real response should be and is pierogi, the delectable Polish dumplings that my mother, Big Martha, made so well in many incarnations: potato, sweet cabbage, blueberry, peach, plum, and apricot.": "Martha",
  "Why would I want a place of my own? Then I would have to things worry about, like doing laundry and having food in the fridge.": "Rafael",
  "It is difficult to get organic food at most restaurants, so when possible, eat at home. When not, do your best.": "Suzanne",
  "I'm not an amazing cook. But I can follow a recipe!": "Rachel",
  "Music is my breath, blood and food - without music I would perish; the actor in me would die.": "Dhanush",
  "There's so much importance in honoring your everyday hero. It doesn't take money. It doesn't take connections. What matters is that people get involved. Whether your passion is gun control or food or whatever it may be, everybody needs to stop being so self-absorbed.": "Debi",
  "We have friends in Italy who have these old stoves, and they turn out the most beautiful food. All you really need is time, the best ingredients, and love.": "Debi",
  "Frankly, any city person who doesn't think I deserve a white-collar salary as a farmer doesn't deserve my special food.": "Joel",
  "Our biggest fear is that 'Food, Inc.' will move heavy-handed food-safety regulations forward.": "Joel",
  "When I'm working, I need to be pretty disciplined, but I do like to enjoy my food. I like to keep it fresh and wholesome. Preparing your own food can be a great way to unwind.": "Julia",
  "Growing up, my dad owned a restaurant in Washington, DC, and food was something I was passionate about. But when I finally got into it, I felt like it was so late in the game; that's why I worked seven days a week at Craft and Mercer Kitchen. I wanted to see how far I could take it.": "David",
  "Why can't it be awesome to work for a food company? Why can't we create an environment where people are trying to push each other to do great things, and we're not trying to steal from anybody - we're trying to be good to our farmers and run an honorable business, if there is such a thing anymore?": "David",
  "I find that there are a lot of similarities between French and Japanese food. I think they're two countries that have really systemized their cuisine and codified it.": "David",
  "When I was growing up, I was eating fast food every day. I'd drink soda non-stop, candy, just everything. It was horrible. My go-to was McDonald's, for sure.": "Ryan",
  "I would never be able to lead the insane lifestyle I do, traveling all over the world, if I wasn't eating food that was simple and healthy.": "Alain",
  "When you grow up close to poultry and fields and gardens and open-air markets, you can't help but develop an instinct for quality food.": "Alain",
  "I hid myself in food.": "Gordon",
  "Peruvian food is so simple yet amazingly flavored with their traditional spices.": "L'Wren",
  "Growing up eating fruits and vegetables fresh from our farm added a lot to the way I taste and look at food today, and I wanted the same for my kids and other kids.": "Camila",
  "I love France. It's got the sun down at the bottom, the Alps for skiing, and all that wine and food.": "Paul",
  "My philosophy from day one is that I can sleep better at night if I can improve an individual's knowledge about food and wine, and do it on a daily basis.": "Emeril",
  "You know, for 300 years it's been kind of the same. There are restaurants in New Orleans that the menu hasn't changed in 125 years, so how is one going to change or evolve the food?": "Emeril",
  "I love, love, love the street-cart food. Gyros are like a meat-flavored fruit roll-up. A meat roll-up.": "Kumail",
  "Ever notice that Soup for One is eight aisles away from Party Mix?": "Elayne",
  "I love Italian food; it's soulful like French food. Italian food is original and homey; it's market-driven, but also can be locally sourced.": "Daniel",
  "Consumers deserve the right to know what's in their food - and obviously, most people want that choice. It's hard to see how more knowledge about the products we eat every day can hurt us.": "Michael",
  "Of course I love cooking Eastern European food because I'm a Jew, but I also love making roast chicken. I love making Hungarian goulash. There are a lot of egg noodles in my cooking.": "Judy",
  "If you're going to America, bring your own food.": "Fran",
  "There is so much more vegetable use in Thailand, India and China than meat. Yes, when you go to the markets or buy street food, you see shrimp or chicken - but mostly vegetables.": "Jean-Georges",
  "We would load up the yellow Cutlass Supreme station wagon and pick blackberries during blackberry season or spring onions during spring onion season. For us, food was part of the fabric of our day.": "Mario",
  "In America, I would say New York and New Orleans are the two most interesting food towns. In New Orleans, they don't have a bad deli. There's no mediocrity accepted.": "Mario",
  "In France, cooking is a serious art form and a national sport.": "Julia",
  "Animals that we eat are raised for food in the most economical way possible, and the serious food producers do it in the most humane way possible. I think anyone who is a carnivore needs to understand that meat does not originally come in these neat little packages.": "Julia",
  "I don't believe in twisting yourself into knots of excuses and explanations over the food you make.": "Julia",
  "I love to cook comfort food. I'll make fish and vegetables or meat and vegetables and potatoes or rice. The ritual of it is fun for me, and the creativity of it.": "Reese",
  "When women earn the money for the family, everyone in the family benefits. We also know that when women have an income, everyone wins because women dedicate 90% of the income to health, education, to food security, to the children, to the family, or to the community, so when women have an income, everybody wins.": "Michelle",
  "My mother, we were a very poor family. When I was a kid, we would be in our little room, and there would be a knock on the door almost every night with a hobo begging for food. Even though we didn't even have enough to eat, my mother always found something to give them.": "Kirk",
  "I've been a foodie most of my life. I started when I lived for a year in Germany in my early 20s, and here was this new food environment, and I decided I needed to make sense of it. And I found it was the rules of economics that do the best job. Food is a capitalist product of supply and demand.": "Tyler",
  "A lot of local food is very tasty. I'm very happy to eat it. I just don't think it's the same thing as saving the world.": "Tyler",
  "I really like to sometimes go into food detox and eat very simply.": "Padma",

  "My idea of fast food is a mallard.": "Ted",
  "What I've been developing is a vegan fast food chain and vegan food markets.": "Heather",
  "The best food I've had was actually in catering at 'Single Ladies.' It's insane. I can't live in Atlanta. In fact, even if I'm offered, I'm not sure I could come back for another six months, because I'll just be fat.": "Ricky",
  "I don't like food that's too carefully arranged it makes me think that the chef is spending too much time arranging and not enough time cooking. If I wanted a picture I'd buy a painting.": "Andy",
  "I think what I do differently from a lot of TV chefs is that I break down barriers and make fine food more accessible to the regular person, who might be intimidated. I try hard, particularly with wine, to make it not intimidating. It's sort of a teaching job.": "Ted",
  "Attitudes toward food have completely changed.": "Giada",
  "I'm into very colorful food. Obviously lots of flavor, but I think we eat with our eyes first, so it has to look great. The presentation has to be great.": "Giada",
  "If food were free, why work?": "Douglas",
  "I will never use a substitute for butter. Margarine is one molecule away from eating plastic. If I'm going to eat that type of food, it's going to be the real deal.": "Paula",
  "Most fast food is fried. Fried food tastes great, and people don't seem to care about the fat aspect.": "Eric",
  "The worst vice of the solitary is the worship of his food.": "Cyril",
  "Someone has to take the garbage out, someone has to cook the food, and someone has to clean the dishes. I want to do all of that.": "Paula",
  "I think 'Soul Food' had the biggest impact on me because that's where I was really able to shine as an actress and because I also met my husband there, and that was a huge turning point in my personal life. So, that show will stick with me forever and ever and ever.": "Nicole",
  "It's fantastic to strive towards a nice life where you eat nice organic food and your children go to a nice school and you can afford nice clothes and nice perfume and the hypoallergenic make-up. But there's never a day goes by, and I mean this from the bottom of my heart, that I don't think about where I'm from.": "Samantha",
  "I really love good food occasionally, but I need time to enjoy it, and I need to be hungry.": "Clare",
  "Meat is a big deal in my life. I do love breakfast food, but I don't think that's extraordinary. I'm a normal American. We love eggs and meat and potatoes and gravy.": "Nick",
  "Technology is, of course, a double edged sword. Fire can cook our food but also burn us.": "Jason",
  "Our minds are like our stomaches; they are whetted by the change of their food, and variety supplies both with fresh appetite.": "Quintilian",
  "I don't really believe in diets. I love food... If I deprive myself, I'm going to want it more. I snack on yogurt, raw cashews and cherry tomatoes.": "Nicole",
  "Parents are working more than ever before and unable to monitor what kids are eating at home, and schools are selling astronomical amounts of junk food in order to supplement shrinking budgets. It's a ticking time bomb, and America's children are exploding.": "Lisa",
  "Acceptable food rots while we are chased from bins behind restaurants, chased from sleeping on the street, chased from relieving ourselves unless we pay for food or gas, until finally we are so hungry, sleepless, smelly, constipated and beaten-down that we simply die of lack of will to live.": "Jane",
  "LOVE: A word properly applied to our delight in particular kinds of food sometimes metaphorically spoken of the favorite objects of all our appetites.": "Henry",
  "There are good intentions behind many people's conversion to veganism, including an admirable devotion to the well-being of animals and a justified skepticism about the crap the USDA allows manufacturers to put in our food. But it's hard to ignore the often sanctimonious nature of what some nutritionists view as an 'extremist' way of eating.": "Julie",
  "I would love having Winnie-the-Pooh stay here at the house. We could talk of food and what we were eating next. Maybe ponder that over a little morsel... and then take a little nap and dream of desserts.": "Tony",
  "I want to safeguard the value of lunch. For me, it is sacred. My family and I always have lunch and dinner together. And we always sit down. Food does not taste the same if you are standing up!": "Brunello",
  "The kitchen oven is reliable, but it's made us lazy.": "Jamie",
  "Give your kids a bloody knife and fork and let me put some fresh food in front of them they can eat.": "Jamie",
  "If I could only have one type of food with me, I would bring soy sauce. The reason being that if I have soy sauce, I can flavor a lot of things.": "Martin",
  "I always say centered food equals centered behavior.": "Marilu",
  "I like to add props to render the specificities of place - paintings, food, clothing, signs, infrastructure, music, sayings and slang particular to the region and particular to the character. And props shouldn't just sit there; they should get used.": "Kaui",
  "I love to take something ordinary and make it really special.": "Ina",
  "Miss Child is never bashful with butter.": "Phil",

  "We are already perilously close to killing off the top of the oceanic food chain - with catastrophic consequences that we can't begin to imagine. Let us not, in the heat of anger, reduce the already devastated population of great white sharks by one more member.": "Peter",

  "Gujarat is truly vibrant. Be it handicrafts, folk music, art, costumes or food - the state offers the best of everything.": "Shreya",

  "Make food a very incidental part of your life by filling your life so full of meaningful things that you'll hardly have time to think about food.": "Peace",
  "There aren't many great passages written about food, but I love one by George Millar, who worked for the SOE in the second world war and wrote a book called 'Horned Pigeon.' He had been on the run and hadn't eaten for a week, and his description of the cheese fondue he smells in the peasant kitchen of a house in eastern France is unbelievable.": "Sebastian",
  "The maker movement is about people who want to gain more control of the human design world that they interact with every day. Instead of accepting off-the-shelf solutions from institutions and corporations, makers would like to make, modify, and repair their own tools, clothing, food, toys, furniture, and other physical objects.": "Mark",

  "Sitting down to a meal with an Indian family is different from sitting down to a meal with a British family.": "Roland",
  "Food to me, in one word, is 'creativity' or 'expression.' It's simply, 'This is who I am at this point in time, and this is what I want to cook for you.'": "Graham",
  "The old injunction 'Don't talk with your mouth full' is based on the presumption that, however multifunctional a mouth may be, it should only perform one job at a time. Humans have found a way around this limitation in the form of food writing.": "Bee",
  "Maybe a person's time would be as well spent raising food as raising money to buy food.": "Frank",
  "As I got older and more educated about things like chemicals in food and how beef is processed, I simply stopped eating certain things because it felt like the right thing to do.": "Lindsay",
  "Food can become such a point of anxiety - not because it's food, but just because you have anxiety. That's how eating disorders develop.": "Vanessa",
  "In my travels, I also noticed that kids in Thailand like spicy food, and kids in India love curry. I'm hoping to introduce my son, Hudson, to lots of veggies and spices when he's young. I say that before he's started on solid foods, so it could be easier in theory than practice!": "Curtis",
  "It's easy for Americans to forget that the food they eat doesn't magically appear on a supermarket shelf.": "Christopher",

  "Provision as much pure and organic food as you can, and let the rest go by.": "Laurie",
  "I eat a variety of foods like vegetables, fruit and beef for protein and iron.": "Sasha",
  "I really liked the food in Japan. There is something so organized, neat, and methodical about it. They put a lot of care and quality into their cooking. I also love Mediterranean, New American, and Italian food, because the cuisines borrow influences from all over the world.": "Sasha",
  "I don't always buy organic food. It is more expensive.": "Alexandra",
  "I think Australian food is probably some of the best in the world.": "Karrie",
  "Appetite, craving for food, is a constant and powerful stimulator of the gastric glands.": "Ivan",
  "From the described experiment it is clear that the mere act of eating, the food even not reaching the stomach, determines the stimulation of the gastric glands.": "Ivan",
  "Too many people just eat to consume calories. Try dining for a change.": "John",
  "'Shkoff' is to eat. 'Shkiaff' is to slap. Like, 'Gettouttahere I'm gonna give you a couple of shkiaffs,' or, 'Forget presentation, just shkiaff the food onto the plate.'": "Nadia",
  "The simpler the food, the harder it is to prepare it well. You want to truly taste what it is you're eating. So that goes back to the trend of fine ingredients. It's very Japanese: Preparing good ingredients very simply, without distractions from the flavor of the ingredient itself.": "Joel",
  "I always knew that food and wine were vital, with my mother being Italian and a good cook.": "Robert",
  "When all else fails, dress beautifully and throw your food.": "Gail",
  "I used to make my own food and ate on my own in my room.": "Victoria",
  "I like to eat and I love the diversity of foods.": "David",
  "I can make dressing - or stuffing. Y'all call it stuffing up here, we call it dressing down there. It's really good dressing. That family recipe was passed on, and I love to make that.": "Edie",
  "I like to say, 'Chop suey's the biggest culinary joke that one culture has ever played on another,' because chop suey, if you translate into Chinese, means 'tsap sui,' which, if you translate back, means 'odds and ends.'": "Jennifer",
  "We all thought of chicken as lean, protein-rich food that's good for weight watching, but the truth is chicken might actually be making us fatter!": "Kathy",
  "I made the connection between food and weight, but feeling good or bad was a separate issue.": "Robin",
  "The position is: the Gaelic language is no longer the native language; it is dead, yet food is being brought to the graveyard.": "Patrick",

  "Food is ever-changing and ever moving forward and getting more and more complex.": "Alexandra",
  "It is obvious that the greatest and most important service that is required of our agriculture under existing conditions is an enlarged production of the staple food crops.": "David",
  "I think e-mail is representative of our fast food mentality in the United States, where everything has gotten faster and faster, and we're required to respond to inputs more quickly with less time for thought and reflection. I believe that we need to slow down.": "Alan",
  "My favorite comfort food would have be braised beef. You know, beef, slow-cooked in a Dutch oven or in a slow cooker until it falls apart with simple mushrooms, some onions and lots of fresh thyme and garlic.": "Tyler",
  "Most vegetarians look so much like the food they eat that they can be classified as cannibals.": "Finley",
  "Poor, darling fellow - he died of food. He was killed by the dinner table.": "Diana",
  "Whenever I'd go to restaurants, the main chef came out and was cooking for me, and he's asking me how the food is. I get, like, VIP service, so it's weird.": "Inbee",
  "Groceries became a revelation: the people coming out with bundles of food. It's all like a great ceremony, and the whole drudgery of shopping has become my inspiration.": "Corita",

  "If I had the choice between smoked salmon and tinned salmon, I'd have it tinned. With vinegar.": "Harold",
  "Eating without conversation is only stoking.": "Marcelene",
  "I know my husband really loves me because he takes me to have ribs. He says I'm the only girl he ever took out who actually ate anything on her plate, as opposed to pushing it around.": "Julia",
  "Sometimes when I speak to groups or I'm interviewed by a journalist, I ask them to imagine their communities without Girl Scouts - to imagine the thousands of food drives and clothing and toy collections that would never take place if not for Girl Scouts.": "Anna",

  "Working in front of the camera keeps me alive. I couldn't care less about actors' trailers and food on sets and stuff like that - I just want to act.": "Chow",
  "There is increasing social concern about our use of nonhumans for experiments, food, clothing and entertainment. This concern about animals reflects both our own moral development as a civilization and our recognition that the differences between humans and animals are, for the most part, differences of degree and not of kind.": "Gary",
  "I'd like to have any sort of Mexican or Italian food any time of the day!": "Brenda",
  "When I was first approached for 'Pass the Plate,' I was thrilled because I love to cook. And I love to cook healthy. The reason I started cooking was because I would go to restaurants and have just amazing food but feel so heavy and gross. I would go home and try to cook the same thing, but a healthy version.": "Brenda",
  "If we as a society are willing to have a preference for organic food, the farmer can pass on the savings.": "Robert",

  "Prayer does not change God, but it changes him who prays.": "Soren",
  "Parents and schools should place great emphasis on the idea that it is all right to be different. Racism and all the other 'isms' grow from primitive tribalism, the instinctive hostility against those of another tribe, race, religion, nationality, class or whatever. You are a lucky child if your parents taught you to accept diversity.": "Roger",
  "I believe in the religion of Islam. I believe in Allah and peace.": "Muhammad",
  "I never considered a difference of opinion in politics, in religion, in philosophy, as cause for withdrawing from a friend.": "Thomas",

  "The World is my country, all mankind are my brethren, and to do good is my religion.": "Thomas",
  "Every man lives in two realms: the internal and the external. The internal is that realm of spiritual ends expressed in art, literature, morals, and religion. The external is that complex of devices, techniques, mechanisms, and instrumentalities by means of which we live.": "Martin",
  "Worship is a way of seeing the world in the light of God.": "Abraham",
  "The truth is that killing innocent people is always wrong - and no argument or excuse, no matter how deeply believed, can ever make it right.

  "We are a nation of immigrants, a quilt of many colors, and we've managed over more than two centuries to create a way of life that allows for a reasonable degree of upward mobility, that prizes individual liberty, promotes freedom of religion and genuinely values equal rights for all citizens.": "Jay",
  "The essence of America - that which really unites us - is not ethnicity, or nationality or religion - it is an idea - and what an idea it is: That you can come from humble circumstances and do great things.": "Condoleezza",

  "Fashion is almost like a religion, for me at least.": "ASAP",
  "We have been educated into believing someone else's concept of the deity, and someone else's standard of beauty. You have the right to practice any religion and politics in a way that best suits your freedom, your dignity, and your understanding. And once you do that, you don't apologize.": "John",
  "God is a metaphor for that which transcends all levels of intellectual thought. It's as simple as that.": "Joseph",
  "Religion is part of the human make-up. It's also part of our cultural and intellectual history.

  "Most people are defined by their titles, their cars, their house, where they came from, their color, their race, their religion.

  "Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God is acknowledged.": "Ronald",
  "Islam does not believe in democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of the press, or freedom of assembly. It does not separate religion and politics. It is partly a religion, but it is much more than that. It has a political agenda that goes far outside the realm of religion.": "Pauline",

  "I know the Bible is inspired because it inspires me.": "Dwight",

  "Religion and culture are two important ways in which we as humans find our identity. That's certainly true for me.": "Gene",
  "I cannot think that when God sent us into the world, he had irreversibly decreed that we should be perpetually miserable in it. If our taking up the Cross imply our bidding adieu to all joy and satisfaction, how is it reconcilable with what Solomon expressly affirms of religion, that 'her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace?'": "John",
  "When we blindly adopt a religion, a political system, a literary dogma, we become automatons. We cease to grow.": "Anais",

  "When the missionaries came to Africa they had the Bible and we had the land. They said 'Let us pray.' We closed our eyes. When we opened them we had the Bible and they had the land.": "Desmond",
  "For the record, I don't worship the devil. I just hate religion.": "Tyler,",
  "The difference between a saint and a hypocrite is that one lies for his religion, the other by it.": "Minna",
  "An important function of theology is to keep religion tied to reason and reason to religion. Both roles are of essential importance for humanity.": "Pope",
  "I do not believe that the people of Ontario judge their leaders on the basis of race, sexual orientation, colour or religion. I don't believe they hold that prejudice in their hearts.": "Kathleen",
  "I would rather live my life as if there is a God and die to find out there isn't, than live as if there isn't and to die to find out that there is.": "Albert",
  "It's wonderful to climb the liquid mountains of the sky. Behind me and before me is God and I have no fears.": "Helen",
  "If religion were true, its followers would not try to bludgeon their young into an artificial conformity; but would merely insist on their unbending quest for truth, irrespective of artificial backgrounds or practical consequences.": "H.",
  "In thinking about religion and society in the 21st century, we should broaden the conversation about faith from doctrinal debates to the larger question of how it might inspire us to strengthen the bonds of belonging that redeem us from our solitude, helping us to construct together a gracious and generous social order.": "Jonathan",
  "Freedom of speech, freedom of the press, and freedom of religion all have a double aspect - freedom of thought and freedom of action.": "Frank",
  "Religion creates community, community creates altruism and altruism turns us away from self and towards the common good... There is something about the tenor of relationships within a religious community that makes it the best tutorial in citizenship and good neighborliness.": "Jonathan",
  "True Americanism is opposed utterly to any political divisions resting on race and religion.": "Henry",
  "I know it's very idealistic and utopian, but I believe we need to just let everyone not be judged in terms of religion, groups or nations or region.": "Shah",
  "Religion is just mind control.": "George",
  "I am a deeply religious nonbeliever - this is a somewhat new kind of religion.": "Albert",
  "One act of obedience is better than one hundred sermons.": "Dietrich",

  "The truths of religion are never so well understood as by those who have lost the power of reason.": "Voltaire",
  "It was not a religion that attacked us that September day. It was al-Qaeda. We will not sacrifice the liberties we cherish or hunker down behind walls of suspicion and mistrust.": "Barack",
  "Religion is the search for ultimate meaning.": "Viktor",
  "Whether one believes in a religion or not, and whether one believes in rebirth or not, there isn't anyone who doesn't appreciate kindness and compassion.": "Dalai",
  "Religion is the idol of the mob it adores everything it does not understand.": "Frederick",
  "Since many of you do not belong to the Catholic Church and others are non-believers, from the bottom of my heart I give this silent blessing to each and every one of you, respecting the conscience of each one of you but knowing that each one of you is a child of God.": "Pope",
  "When it is a question of money, everybody is of the same religion.": "Voltaire",
  "To a mind like mine, restless, inquisitive, and observant of everything that was passing, it is easy to suppose that religion was the subject to which it would be directed; and, although this subject principally occupied my thoughts, there was nothing that I saw or heard of to which my attention was not directed.": "Nat",
  "If one has the answers to all the questions - that is the proof that God is not with him. It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself. The great leaders of the people of God, like Moses, have always left room for doubt. You must leave room for the Lord, not for our certainties; we must be humble.": "Pope",
  "Religion is capable of driving people to such dangerous folly that faith seems to me to qualify as a kind of mental illness.": "Richard",
  "Nothing defines humans better than their willingness to do irrational things in the pursuit of phenomenally unlikely payoffs. This is the principle behind lotteries, dating, and religion.": "Scott",
  "My definition, the definition that I've always believed in, is that esprit de corps means love for one's own military legion - in my case, the United States Marine Corps. It means more than self-preservation, religion, or patriotism. I've also learned that this loyalty to one's corps travels both ways: up and down.": "Chesty",
  "The very idea that we get a moral compass from religion is horrible. Not only should we not get our moral compass from religion, as a matter of fact we don't.": "Richard",
  "In politics, as in religion, it is equally absurd to aim at making proselytes by fire and sword. Heresies in either can rarely be cured by persecution.": "Alexander",
  "In nearly every religion I am aware of, there is a variation of the golden rule. And even for the non-religious, it is a tenet of people who believe in humanistic principles.": "Hillary",
  "I care not much for a man's religion whose dog and cat are not the better for it.": "Abraham",
  "Patriotism is a kind of religion it is the egg from which wars are hatched.": "Guy",

  "To fall in love is to create a religion that has a fallible god.": "Jorge",
  "It's a bit odd that nobody seems to be using the correct technical term to describe organized Islamic terrorists. They are not a faction of a religion or a social movement. They are a cult. A suicide cult.": "Craig",
  "Take away the Book of Mormon and the revelations, and where is our religion? We have none.": "Joseph",
  "I am not systematic at all when it comes to religion. I just love life. And I'm not judgmental. And I'm a vegetarian.": "Erykah",
  "I say quite deliberately that the Christian religion, as organized in its Churches, has been and still is the principal enemy of moral progress in the world.": "Bertrand",
  "The Americans combine the notions of religion and liberty so intimately in their minds, that it is impossible to make them conceive of one without the other.": "Alexis",
  "Religion must mainly be a matter of principles only. It cannot be a matter of rules. The moment it degenerates into rules, it ceases to be a religion, as it kills responsibility which is an essence of the true religious act.": "B.",
  "Since Castro took power, the Cuban people have been denied basic human freedoms. No freedom of religion, no freedom of the press, no political freedom. And the regime uses brutality and violence to suppress these freedoms and impose its will.": "Mitt",
  "Whether you call it Buddhism or another religion, self-discipline, that's important. Self-discipline with awareness of consequences.": "Dalai",
  "I almost got a psychology degree, I almost got a philosophy degree. I kept changing it so they couldn't make me graduate. I studied anthropology and eastern religion, epistomology, and astronomy... I took every interesting course I could find for nine years.": "Patrick",
  "I believe in mysticism, with an interior goal, and you are your own temple and your own priest. I don't believe anymore in religions, because you see today there are religious wars, prejudice, false morals, and the woman is despised. Religion is too old now; it's from another century, it's not for today.": "Alejandro",
  "Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people, but God in creation has set us free: it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person.": "Pope",
  "You can't understand European history at all other than through religion, or English literature either if you can't recognise biblical allusions.": "Richard",
  "No human heart is denied empathy. No religion can demolish that by indoctrination. No culture, no nation and nationalism - nothing can touch it because it is empathy.": "Dayananda",
  "Same-sex marriage is not the final nail in the coffin for traditional marriage. It is just another road sign toward the substitution of government for God. Every moral discussion now pits the wisest moral arbiters among us - the Supreme Court, President Obama - against traditional religion.": "Ben",
  "Monotheism makes me grouchy. I don't trust any religion that makes God look like one of the ruling class. I guess I'm a pagan or an animist.": "Gloria",
  "I say I haven't lost my religion. I've lost my ideology.": "Maajid",
  "It is a debt we owe to the purity of our religion to show that it is at variance with that law which warrants slavery.": "Patrick",
  "There is only one religion, though there are a hundred versions of it.": "George",
  "It is a masterpiece of the devil to make us believe that children cannot understand religion. Would Christ have made a child the standard of faith if He had known that it was not capable of understanding His words?": "Dwight",
  "Religion is a temper, not a pursuit.": "Harriet",
  "I'd like Muslims to look at their religion as a set of beliefs that they can appraise critically and pick and choose from.": "Ayaan",
  "I think my politics are just inclined to be empathetic and humanistic. I grew up with so many different kinds of people with different politics, different religion, no religion, no politics, education, no education, and I was infatuated with all of them.": "Lily",
  "In Mesopotamia or Egypt, for example, the monarch had a god-like religious status. But this is not the case in Judaism. So that notion that religion can go on, when all the markers of power and trappings of monarchy disappear, ultimately serves the endurance of Judaism very well.": "Simon",
  "Morality is of the highest importance - but for us, not for God.": "Albert",
  "I told the brethren that the Book of Mormon was the most correct of any book on earth, and the keystone of our religion, and a man would get nearer to God by abiding by its precepts, than by any other book.": "Joseph",
  "It was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion.": "Albert",
  "Religion is for people who are scared to go to hell. Spirituality is for people who have already been there.": "Bonnie",
  "Christianity began as a religion of the poor and dispossessed - farmers, fishermen, Bedouin shepherds. There's a great lure to that kind of simplicity and rigor - the discipline, the call to action.": "Camille",
  "What religion a man holds, to what race he belongs, these things are not important; the really important thing is this knowledge: the knowledge of God's plan for men. For God has a plan, and that plan is evolution.": "Jiddu",
  "Religion is among the most beautiful and most natural of all things - that religion which 'sees God in clouds and hears Him in the wind,' which endows every object of sense with a living soul, which finds in the system of nature whatever is holy, mysterious and venerable, and inspires the bosom with sentiments of awe and veneration.": "William",
  "The Left is doing to America what it has done to almost everything it has deeply influenced - the arts, the university, religion, culture, minorities, Europe: ruining it.": "Dennis",
  "If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act.": "Robert",
  "Religion is the impotence of the human mind to deal with occurrences it cannot understand.": "Karl",
  "Abraham is such a fascinating figure. Three world religions - Judaism, Christianity, and Islam - all claim him as a patriarch. He was raised in a religious home. And yet he rejected religion in order to pursue a personal relationship with God.": "Anne",
  "We are always on the anvil by trials God is shaping us for higher things.": "Henry",
  "We can only learn to know ourselves and do what we can - namely, surrender our will and fulfill God's will in us.": "Saint",
  "The Christian religion not only was at first attended with miracles, but even at this day cannot be believed by any reasonable person without one.": "David",
  "America was first colonized by Puritans. Most of our earliest immigrants, and many since, have come here in order to practice their religious beliefs as they please. Our culture has always been, and will most likely always be, profoundly influenced by religion.": "James",
  "No matter the nationality, no matter the religion, no matter the ethnic background, America brings out the best in people.": "Arnold",
  "He, however, who begins with Metaphysics, will not only become confused in matters of religion, but will fall into complete infidelity.": "Maimonides",
  "Nothing has done more to separate and divide human beings one from another than exclusivist organized religion.": "Neale",
  "God's love is too great to be confined to any one side of a conflict or to any one religion.": "Desmond",
  "You can have religion with spirituality. You can also have religion without spirituality.": "Eckhart",
  "In religion, there's a certain type of fear that if somebody believes differently from me, that it's a threat. Because I'm right, and there cannot be two ways that are right, so if I'm right, anything different than this must be wrong; and we attack those things and it's really due to insecurity, ego and fear.": "Radhanath",
  "I have long believed that celebrity, the way we worship and package and sell our pop stars, is what filled the need for gods that was once filled by the pictures in stained glass. Hollywood is post-Christian Venice - in other words, a pantheon of saints without the hassle and heartache of religion.": "Rich",
  "I think we need to do some deep soul searching about what's important in our lives and renew our spirit and our spiritual thinking, whether it's through faith-based religion or just through loving nature or helping your fellow man.": "Louie",
  "The story of the decadence of the cathedral as a moral power, a spiritual energizer in civilization, is the sad but inevitable story of dogmatism. It is the story of the struggle of free thought with bigotry, religion making common cause with the wrong side.": "Jenkin",
  "I never felt I had anything to hide. I never felt being gay was anything to be ashamed of, so I never felt apologetic. I didn't have issues with it, didn't grow up with any religion, so I didn't have any religious, you know, issues to deal with as far as homosexuality is concerned. So, I accepted it very easily. For me, it wasn't that big a deal.": "Martina",
  "My concern with religion is that it allows us by the millions to believe what only lunatics or idiots could believe on their own. That's not to say that all religious people are lunatics or idiots. It's anything but that.": "Sam",
  "I know of no wars started by anyone to impose lack of religion on someone else. We have lethal Sunni v Shia, Catholic against Protestant, but no agnostic suicide bombers attack crowded atheist pubs.": "Simon",
  "There are many of us that are willing to do great things for the Lord, but few of us are willing to do little things.": "Dwight",
  "We are punished by our sins, not for them.": "Elbert",
  "God is a thought who makes crooked all that is straight.": "Friedrich",

  "The major civilizing force in the world is not religion, it is sex.": "Hugh",
  "The world is divided into men who have wit and no religion and men who have religion and no wit.": "Avicenna",
  "Science investigates religion interprets. Science gives man knowledge which is power religion gives man wisdom which is control.": "Martin",
  "I have been astonished that men could die martyrs for religion - I have shuddered at it. I shudder no more - I could be martyred for my religion - Love is my religion - I could die for that.": "John",
  "What we have done, the result of that comes to us whenever it comes, either today, tomorrow, hundred years later, hundred lives later, whatever, whatever. And so, it's our own karma. That is why that philosophy in every religion: Killing is sin. Killing is sin in every religion.": "Maharishi",
  "Most people are enduring a marginalized isolation. One of the great obstacles to modern friendships is the 'religion of rush.' People are rushing all the time through time. Friendship takes time.": "John",
  "Freedom of religion is a fundamental Constitutional principle. It's a founding principle of this country.": "Paul",
  "God requireth not a uniformity of religion.": "Roger",
  "Revealed religion is one thing, revealed legislation, another.": "Moses",

  "I maintain that Truth is a pathless land, and you cannot approach it by any path whatsoever, by any religion, by any sect.": "Jiddu",
  "I think it's imperative to have faith or religion, because it's good to have morals, to be kind to others.": "Tinie",
  "I have no religion, and at times I wish all religions at the bottom of the sea. He is a weak ruler who needs religion to uphold his government; it is as if he would catch his people in a trap.": "Mustafa",
  "I'm married to the street I ain't gonna switch over. I ain't gonna go religion on nobody. I believe in God - God is for the thugs too - but the streets are in the most trouble. So I'mma keep it focused on the streets and the struggle. That's what I'm mainly about.": "Trick",
  "I cannot adequately express the horror I feel for a man who can be so base as to veil his hypocrisy under the cloak of religion, and state the base falsehood he has done.": "James",
  "You should always take what I say about religion with a grain of salt, because the 7 deadly sins are more like my seven daily activities. I try to check them all off at least once a day. All of them except gluttony; my trainer keeps that under control.": "Milo",
  "Communism, like any other revealed religion, is largely made up of prophecies.": "H.",
  "The fact is that more people have been slaughtered in the name of religion than for any other single reason. That, that my friends, is true perversion.": "Harvey",
  "Religion points to that area of human experience where in one way or another man comes upon mystery as a summons to pilgrimage.": "Frederick",
  "Where knowledge ends, religion begins.": "Benjamin",
  "Existentialism is about being a saint without God; being your own hero, without all the sanction and support of religion or society.": "Anita",
  "Fear of things invisible in the natural seed of that which everyone in himself calleth religion.": "Thomas",
  "Religion is the state of being grasped by an ultimate concern, a concern which qualifies all other concerns as preliminary and which itself contains the answer to the question of a meaning of our life.": "Paul",
  "If I were going to convert to any religion I would probably choose Catholicism because it at least has female saints and the Virgin Mary.": "Margaret",
  "We are a nation that is unenlightened because of religion. I do believe that. I think religion stops people from thinking. I think it justified crazies.": "Bill",
  "The trouble with many men is that they have got just enough religion to make them miserable. If there is not joy in religion, you have got a leak in your religion.": "Billy",
  "Religion fails if it cannot speak to men as they are.": "William",
  "I found a religion that blended scientific reason with spiritual reality in a unifying faith far removed from the headlines of violence, destruction and terrorism.": "Cat",
  "Religion has caused more misery to all of mankind in every stage of human history than any other single idea.": "Madalyn",
  "By our form of government, the Christian religion is the established religion; and all sects and denominations of Christians are placed upon the same equal footing, and are equally entitled to protection in their religious liberty.": "Samuel",
  "Do not imagine that what we have said of the insufficiency of our understanding and of its limited extent is an assertion founded only on the Bible: for philosophers likewise assert the same, and perfectly understand it,- without having regard to any religion or opinion.": "Maimonides",
  "Real religion is no religion at all.": "Lauryn",
  "I think what I and most other sociologists of religion wrote in the 1960s about secularization was a mistake. Our underlying argument was that secularization and modernity go hand in hand. With more modernization comes more secularization.": "Peter",
  "So much of religion is exegesis. I would rather follow in the footprints of Christ than all of the dogma.": "Christy",
  "The Grateful Dead are our religion. This is a religion that doesn't pay homage to the God that all the other religions pay homage to.": "Ken",

  "A religion without mystery must be a religion without God.": "Jeremy",
  "There is not enough religion in the world even to destroy religion.": "Friedrich",
  "I can't understand people calling themselves religious and being hateful. If a preacher is preaching hate, to fear God that's not religion, that's not helping humanity, that's organizing an army to defeat somebody.": "Mojo",
  "Religion is doing; a man does not merely think his religion or feel it, he lives his religion as much as he is able, otherwise it is not religion but fantasy or philosophy.": "George",
  "Even the weakest disputant is made so conceited by what he calls religion, as to think himself wiser than the wisest who think differently from him.": "Walter",
  "Religion can be the enemy of God. It's often what happens when God, like Elvis, has left the building.": "Bono",
  "Skip the religion and politics, head straight to the compassion. Everything else is a distraction.": "Talib",
  "Religious people often prefer to be right rather than compassionate. Often, they don't want to give up their egotism. They want their religion to endorse their ego, their identity.": "Karen",
  "Religion survives because it answers three questions that every reflective person must ask. Who am I? Why am I here? How then shall I live?": "Jonathan",
  "I do explicitly see Jewish people as a people - not either a religion or an ethnicity but a people.": "Ken",
  "If our love of God does not directly influence, and even change, how we engage in the issues of our time on this earth, I wonder what good religion is.": "Richard",
  "To speak specifically of our problem with the Muslim world, we are meandering into a genuine clash of civilizations, and we're deluding ourselves with euphemisms. We're talking about Islam being a religion of peace that's been hijacked by extremists. If ever there were a religion that's not a religion of peace, it is Islam.": "Sam",
  "The problem is that religion tends to give people bad reasons to be good.": "Sam",
  "Religion and ritual can be vehicles for entering stillness. It says in Psalm 46:10, 'Be still, and know that I am God.' But they are still just vehicles. The Buddha called his teaching a raft: You don't need to carry it around with you after you've crossed the river.": "Eckhart",
  "I've written almost 200 songs with Bad Religion. No matter where you look in our history, the focus has been trying to instill some of these disturbing realities about the world, some of the implications of evolution into an artistic format that can be interpreted by people who may never study evolution.": "Greg",
  "Bad Religion has never been about criticizing people who are Christian. But we've always been about pointing out the irony and contradictions in Christian theology and the more extreme versions of Christians that seek to challenge modern secularism.": "Greg",
  "The methodologies of examining hip hop are borrowed from sociology, politics, religion, economics, urban studies, journalism, communications theory, American studies, transatlantic studies, black studies, history, musicology, comparative literature, English, linguistics, and other disciplines.": "Michael",
  "Tourism is a very big economic benefit to the Sherpa people, and also, they have very strong ties to their own social attitudes and their own religion, so fortunately, they're not too influenced by many of our Western attitudes.": "Edmund",
  "There is no religion that was founded on intolerance - and no religion that does not value the sanctity of human life.": "Mohamed",
  "What people are really after is, what is my stance on religion or spirituality or God? And I would say, if I find a word that came closest, it would be agnostic.": "Neil",
  "What brings you closer to God is being in service to others. I think any religion or spiritual way of life will indicate that service to others will lead to a connection with a higher power.": "Steve-O",
  "It is the duty and high privilege of every human being to endeavor to improve himself. Effort at self-improvement is the definition sometimes given for religion. It may relate to our actions or to our convictions. In our actions we should aim at goodness; in our convictions, at truth.": "Joseph",
  "When man fell from grace, he lost a kingdom, not a religion. He lost dominion over the earth; He did not lose Heaven. Therefore, mankind's search is not for a religion or for Heaven but for his kingdom.": "Myles",
  "Wherever there is a settled society, religion is necessary; the laws cover manifest crimes, and religion covers secret crimes.": "Voltaire",
  "If a man reaches the heart of his own religion, he has reached the heart of the others, too. There is only one God, and there are many paths to him.": "Mahatma",
  "God is waiting to be gracious, and is willing to make us happy in religion, if we would not run away from him. We refuse to open the window shutters, and complain that it is dark.": "Adoniram",
  "I believe that a government has only one religion - India first. A government has only one holy book - our Constitution. A government has only one kind of devotion - towards nation.": "Narendra",
  "There are things about organized religion which I resent. Christ is revered as the Prince of Peace, but more blood has been shed in His name than any other figure in history. You show me one step forward in the name of religion, and I'll show you a hundred retrogressions.": "Frank",
  "People are not wrong in observing Caste. In my view, what is wrong is their religion, which has inculcated this notion of Caste. If this is correct, then obviously the enemy, you must grapple with is not the people who observe Caste, but the Shastras which teach them this religion of Caste.": "B.",
  "For the record, I believe in God, but I do not believe in religion, period.": "Rodrigo",
  "Not counting the brand of Sunni Islam practised by the so-called Islamic State, there is probably no religion in the world that comes in for more flak than Scientology.": "Louis",
  "Religion is like a personal computer. You let people in if you want to... We're all gods.": "Jay-Z",
  "There are those who would advocate that the voice of religion be silenced, or at least relegated to the purely private sphere.": "Pope",
  "I believe that all men and women are created equal, but it took our country until 1920 to acknowledge this for women. And then it took until 1964, the year before I was born, to outlaw discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. And same-sex marriage became the law of the land in 2015.": "Brad",
  "Sadly, in the highest levels of economic thought in government, questions are not tolerated. It is as if we're dealing with the binary thinking of a fundamentalist religion.": "Michael",
  "I don't have a preferred religion - I'd have to do research. I was born a Christian, but as I've grown into my own man, I don't attach myself to a religion - 100 per cent, I have faith. Then it's locking into what suits me.": "Anthony",
  "In Lebanon, there are completely different opinions and values in one country in terms of religion, modernity, tradition, East and West - which allows for a kind of intellectual development not available anywhere else.": "Rabih",
  "Prisons are built with stones of Law. Brothels with the bricks of religion.": "William",
  "Let the professors of Christianity recommend their religion by deeds of benevolence - by Christian meekness - by lives of temperance and holiness.": "Richard",
  "Where you have no religion, you are sure to have no government, for as religion disappears, anarchy takes place and fixes a compleat Hell on earth till religion returns.": "Daniel",
  "Indeed, in view of its function, religion stands in greater need of a rational foundation of its ultimate principles than even the dogmas of science.": "Muhammad",
  "Judaism boasts of no exclusive revelation of eternal truths that are indispensable to salvation, of no revealed religion in the sense in which that term is usually understood.": "Moses",
  "Twin-sister of Religion, Selfishness.": "Percy",

  "Persecution is not an original feature in any religion but it is always the strongly marked feature of all religions established by law.": "Thomas",
  "The earth is the Lord's fullness thereof: this is no longer a hollow dictum of religion, but a directive for economic action toward human brotherhood.": "Lewis",
  "The seven deadly sins: Want of money, bad health, bad temper, chastity, family ties, knowing that you know things, and believing in the Christian religion.": "Samuel",
  "A people and their religion must be judged by social standards based on social ethics. No other standard would have any meaning if religion is held to be necessary good for the well-being of the people.": "B.",
  "Science and religion are both the same thing. They're there; they're life. If it's not science, it's not a fact.": "Chuck",
  "As you know, the South is known for its hospitality, traditions, football, pageants, and food. Football is almost like a religion here. People say their priorities are faith, family, and then football. People eat, breathe, and sleep it in the South. It's a huge deal.": "Katherine",
  "Religion is never going to go away, and anyone who thinks it will doesn't understand what religion is. It is a language to describe the experience of human nature, so for as long as people struggle to describe what it means to be alive, it will be a ready-made language to express those feelings.": "Reza",
  "Let us recognize that we can no longer tolerate violent oppression of women in the name of religion and culture any more than we would tolerate violent oppression espoused by any other bully in the name of a twisted rationale.": "Ayaan",
  "I wear the Jewish star, but I'm not - I haven't converted to Judaism, and I'm not - I'm not - I'm not Jewish in the conventional sense because the Kaballah is a belief system that predates religion and predates Judaism as an organized religion.": "Madonna",
  "Many churches of all persuasions are hiring research agencies to poll neighborhoods, asking what kind of church they prefer. Then the local churches design themselves to fit the desires of the people. True faith in God that demands selflessness is being replaced by trendy religion that serves the selfish.": "Billy",
  "Communism is a religion that is inspired, directed and motivated by the Devil himself who has declared war against Almighty God.": "Billy",
  "Often, economists spend their energies squabbling with one another, but arguably the more important contrast is between our broadly liberal economic worldview and the various alternatives - common around the globe - that postulate natural hierarchies of religion, ethnicity, caste and gender, often enforced by law and strict custom.": "Tyler",
  "My purpose is to help people look at themselves and begin to shift their concepts. Remember, we are not our country, our race, or religion. We are eternal spirits. Seeing ourselves as spiritual beings without label is a way to transform the world and reach a sacred place for all of humanity.": "Wayne",
  "There is no religion in which everyday life is not considered a prison there is no philosophy or ideology that does not think that we live in alienation.": "Eugene",

  "A society whose members are united by the fact that they think in the same way in regard to the sacred world and its relations with the profane world, and by the fact that they translate these common ideas into common practices, is what is called a Church. In all history, we do not find a single religion without a Church.": "Emile",

  "Religion and art spring from the same root and are close kin. Economics and art are strangers.": "Nathaniel",
  "We first fought the heathens in the name of religion, then Communism, and now in the name of drugs and terrorism. Our excuses for global domination always change.": "Serj",
  "Islam is not a religion of peace. Islam is a religion of submission. Islam means submit.": "Stephen",
  "It is a truism that almost any sect, cult, or religion will legislate its creed into law if it acquires the political power to do so.": "Robert",
  "As a global society, we do not have to agree, endorse or condone the lifestyle choices of others. However, history has taught us that we equally cannot and should not excuse those who would hide behind religion or misuse God's word to justify bigotry and persecution.": "Joyce",
  "Religion has convinced us that there's something else entirely other than concerns about suffering. There's concerns about what God wants, there's concerns about what's going to happen in the afterlife.": "Sam",
  "One of the problems with organized religion is that it has always kept women in a second-class position. They have been viewed as the daughters of Eve.": "Hugh",
  "If religion has given birth to all that is essential in society, it is because the idea of society is the soul of religion.": "Emile",
  "Our rights are interconnected and inseparable. When freedom of expression is threatened, the rights to freedom of association and assembly, of thought, conscience and religion, are also compromised.": "Nazanin",
  "After it is all over, the religion of man is his most important possession.": "John",
  "I believe in having a more open mind and including others who don't share your faith and having dialogue with them. And just having a pure heart and being a good person can bring you closer to God. Because once you believe in one particular religion fully and not others, that requires you to start disliking people who don't share your views.": "Ishmael",
  "In spite of the huge diversity in Malaysia in terms of religion, culture, race, ethnicity and so forth, we've really gone very far in developing this country.": "Najib",
  "I want young people to know that they can belong - whatever your culture, your religion, your sexuality - that you can live life how you want to live it and feel comfortable how you are.": "Jessie",
  "Religion is the solid basis of good morals; therefore education should teach the precepts of religion, and the duties of man toward God.": "Gouverneur",
  "Every high school and college graduate in America should, I think, have some familiarity with statistics, economics and a foreign language such as Spanish. Religion may not be as indispensable, but the humanities should be a part of our repertory. They may not enrich our wallets, but they do enrich our lives. They civilize us. They provide context.": "Nicholas",
  "The day is not far off when the economic problem will take the back seat where it belongs, and the arena of the heart and the head will be occupied or reoccupied, by our real problems - the problems of life and of human relations, of creation and behavior and religion.": "John",
  "I don't call myself a Buddhist. I'm a free spirit. I believe I'm here on earth to admire and enjoy it that's my religion.": "Alice",
  "I believe in a religion that believes in freedom. Any time I have to accept a religion that won't let me fight a battle for my people, I say to hell with that religion.": "Malcolm",
  "People can be only divided into good or bad; their race, religion, nationality don't matter.": "Irena",
  "The greatest tragedy in mankind's entire history may be the hijacking of morality by religion.": "Arthur",
  "Young people all over the world are very frustrated. They are very disillusioned. Many of them are turning their backs on religion. They are walking away from the faith of their parents, and most of this is because religion has failed them.": "Myles",
  "Is it not a species of blasphemy to call the New Testament revealed religion, when we see in it such contradictions and absurdities.": "Thomas",
  "Religion is the recognition of all our duties as divine commands.": "Immanuel",

  "Jesus does not give recipes that show the way to God as other teachers of religion do. He is himself the way.": "Karl",

  "Religion in its humility restores man to his only dignity, the courage to live by grace.": "George",
  "I count religion but a childish toy, and hold there is no sin but ignorance.": "Christopher",
  "All religion seems to need to prove that it's the only truth. And that's where it turns demonic. Because that's when you get religious wars and persecutions and burning heretics at the stake.": "John",
  "When I was a student, I studied philosophy and religion. I talked about being patient. Some people say I was too hopeful, too optimistic, but you have to be optimistic just in keeping with the philosophy of non-violence.": "John",
  "The word 'religion' is only a label. What lies behind that, the most important thing of all, is the word 'faith'. You either have faith, or you don't have faith, or you have degrees of faith - and if you have degrees of faith, then you become agnostic. You're kind of in-between, or you're on the fence.": "Ridley",
  "Religion, any religion, no matter what sort of wonderful religion, never be universal. So now education is universal, so we have to sort of find ways and means through education system, from kindergarten up to university level, to make awareness these good things, the values, inner values.": "Dalai",
  "Of course God is endlessly multi-dimensional so every religion that exists on earth represents some face, some side of God.": "Aleksandr",
  "There is nothing intrinsic linking any religion with any act of violence. The crusades don't prove that Christianity was violent. The Inquisition doesn't prove that Christianity tortures people. But that Christianity did torture people.": "Salman",
  "Religion is dangerous because it allows human beings who don't have all the answers to think that they do.": "Bill",
  "Almost everything has been stolen from us by the patriarchy. Our creativity has been stolen, our creative energies, our religion. I want it back.": "Mary",
  "If, then, you are looking for the way by which you should go, take Christ, because He Himself is the way.": "Thomas",

  "We have enough religion to make us hate, but not enough to make us love one another.": "Jonathan",
  "Superstition is only the fear of belief, while religion is the confidence.": "Marguerite",
  "My first memories of religion were being taken to Episcopal church. My father was Catholic, but my mother, I believe, was Episcopal. So I sort of veered off into the watered-down version of Catholicism.": "Marilyn",
  "Christianity is not about religion. It's about faith, about being held, about being forgiven. It's about finding joy and finding home.": "Bear",
  "A lot of Christian extremism has done a great deal to discredit religion the main religious traditions have abandoned their own intellectual cultures so drastically that no one has any sense of it other than the fringe.": "Marilynne",
  "I've got no problem with anybody's religion. But if you go claiming the Earth is only 10,000 years old, that's just wrong.": "Bill",
  "When I talk about God, I'm not necessarily talking about religion. To me, God is the energy and light that each of us carries.": "Juanes",
  "A true Christian, who is born anew of the Spirit of Christ, is in the simplicity of Christ, and hath no strife or contention with any man about religion.": "Jakob",
  "We need great prophetic leaders in religion and in spirituality... what we are getting is lacking in vision... not able to engage with the diversity of the culture.": "John",
  "That I am not a member of any Christian church is true; but I have never denied the truth of the Scriptures, and I have never spoken with intentional disrespect of religion in general, or of any denomination of Christians in particular.": "Abraham",
  "Tolerance says I am just going to stomach your right to be different. That if you disappear from the face of the earth, I am no better or worse off. But love - love knows that every American has worth and value, no matter what their background, race, religion, or sexual orientation.": "Cory",
  "It's not surprising, then, they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.": "Barack",

  "Religion and slavery are incompatible.": "B.",
  "You have this mounting aggressive ignorance with the rabbit's foot of their particular religion. You don't really have any kind of spiritual law, just a kind of a rabid mental illness. The songs are a little slice of life.": "Joni",
  "God has to speak to each person in their own language, in their own idioms. Take Spanish, Chinese. You can express the same thought, but to different people you have to use a different language. It's the same in religion.": "Huston",
  "True religion is real living; living with all one's soul, with all one's goodness and righteousness.": "Albert",
  "I don't believe in God but I'm very interested in her.": "Arthur",
  "Religion is more like response to a friend than it is like obedience to an expert.": "Austin",
  "I never saw, heard, nor read, that the clergy were beloved in any nation where Christianity was the religion of the country. Nothing can render them popular, but some degree of persecution.": "Jonathan",
  "There was a time when someone would get on a plane and request to move their seat just because the person sitting next to them was of a different ethnicity or religion or nationality. But I don't think my generation wants that. That's how it used to be.": "ASAP",
  "Surely the day will come when color means nothing more than the skin tone, when religion is seen uniquely as a way to speak one's soul, when birth places have the weight of a throw of the dice and all men are born free, when understanding breeds love and brotherhood.": "Josephine",
  "The Twist was a guided missile launched from the ghetto into the heart of suburbia. The Twist succeeded, as politics, religion and law could never do, in writing in the heart and soul what the Supreme Court could only write on the books.": "Eldridge",
  "Religion without humanity is very poor human stuff.": "Sojourner",
  "So potent was religion in persuading to evil deeds.": "Lucretius",

  "Educate men without religion and you make of them but clever devils.": "Arthur",
  "For as long as I care to remember, religion, like the striptease, has always been a display of the power of suggestion. Like the Virgin Birth, it has all too often supported an immaculate deception.": "Bernard",

  "Moral values, and a culture and a religion, maintaining these values are far better than laws and regulations.": "Swami",

  "The Constitution provides for freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.": "Lamar",
  "There is a great difference between Christianity and religion at the south. If a man goes to the communion table, and pays money into the treasury of the church, no matter if it be the price of blood, he is called religious.": "Harriet",
  "Personally, I don't choose any particular religion or symbol or group of words or teachings to define me. That's between me and the most high. You know, my higher self. The Creator.": "Erykah",
  "The basic assumption of the secular society is that modernity overcomes religion.": "Ulrich",
  "A universe with a God would look quite different from a universe without one. A physics, a biology where there is a God is bound to look different. So the most basic claims of religion are scientific. Religion is a scientific theory.": "Richard",
  "Even if it were proven that God didn't exist, Religion would still be Saintly and Divine.": "Charles",
  "Religion is love in no case is it logic.": "Beatrice",
  "To criticize a person for their race is manifestly irrational and ridiculous, but to criticize their religion, that is a right. That is a freedom.": "Rowan",
  "Communism was meant to be an alternative religion.": "David",
  "I think people's perception of a rich girl is literal, but metaphorically I embrace it as being rich in love, spirit, joy and religion. So it's not about money.": "Angie",
  "I don't think the 9/11 attacks taught us anything we didn't already know about religion. It has long been obvious - even to the deeply religious - that religious fanaticism is an extremely dangerous deranger of otherwise sane and goodhearted people.": "Daniel",
  "Keeping religion immune from criticism is both unwarranted and dangerous.": "Lawrence",
  "The usefulness of religion - the fact that it gives life meaning, that it makes people feel good - is not an argument for the truth of any religious doctrine. It's not an argument that it's reasonable to believe that Jesus really was born of a virgin or that the Bible is the perfect word of the creator of the universe.": "Sam",
  "India is a country in which every great religion finds a home.": "Annie",
  "People have evolved into something selfish, greedy and intolerant. People are unaccepting, because of religion, race, gender, sexual orientation... I've seen it in punk clubs, and I've seen it in the world.": "Gerard",
  "Religion doesn't make people bigots. People are bigots and they use religion to justify their ideology.": "Reza",
  "I don't think that people accept the fact that life doesn't make sense. I think it makes people terribly uncomfortable. It seems like religion and myth were invented against that, trying to make sense out of it.": "David",
  "I was born poor and without religion, under a happy sky, feeling harmony, not hostility, in nature. I began not by feeling torn, but in plenitude.": "Albert",
  "I was never pushed into the religion by my mother or anyone else. I made up my own mind when I was old enough. I am not a religious person, but I am spiritual.": "Janet",
  "Secularism is categorically not saying that the religious may not speak out publicly or have a say in public life. It is about saying that religion alone should not confer a privileged say in public life, or greater influence on it. It really is as simple as that.": "Richard",
  "From a constitutional standpoint, the religion of a candidate is supposed to make no difference. Even before the founding fathers dreamed up the First Amendment, they inserted a provision in the Constitution expressly prohibiting any religious test for office.": "Noah",
  "I sometimes wish I had been educated a Catholic, in order to unite the poetry of religion with its higher principles. Are they necessarily inseparable? Is man really so much of a philosopher, that he can conceive of truth in its abstract purity, and divest life and the affections of all the aids of the imagination?": "James",
  "To repay evils with kindness is the religion I was taught to practise, and this will forever be my rule.": "John",
  "We don't understand why we're here, no one's giving us an answer, religion is vague, your parents can't help because they're just people, and it's all terrible, and there's no meaning to anything.": "Adam",
  "I've never meditated in my life. I don't practice yoga nor any religion. I'm a tourist on the realm of stillness.": "Pico",
  "At first, laws evolved out of religious doctrines. It followed that they were recognized only when advantageous to those who practiced the same religion and who appeared equals under the protection of the same gods. For the members of all other cults, there was neither law nor mercy.": "Leon",
  "I was brought up Catholic and know the stench of the Catholic Church. I moved away from religion early, but the impression remains.": "Gunter",
  "The quarrels and divisions about religion were evils unknown to the heathen. The reason was because the religion of the heathen consisted rather in rites and ceremonies than in any constant belief.": "Francis",
  "Other lands may have their charms, and the sunny skies of other climes may be regretted, but it is with pride and gladness that the wanderer sets foot again on British soil, thanking God for the religion and the liberty which have made this weather-beaten island in a northern sea to be the light and glory of the world.": "Isabella",
  "All religions and all communities have the same rights, and it is my responsibility to ensure their complete and total protection. My government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.": "Narendra",
  "What we need is a system of thought - you might even call it a religion - that can bind humans together. A system that would fit the Republic of Chad as well as the United States: a system that would supply our idealistic young people with something to believe in.": "Abraham",
  "Equal protection under the law - for race, religion, gender or sexual orientation - should not be subject to the most popular sentiments of the day.": "Cory",
  "Religious beliefs have played a vital role in forming America's character as well as my own. I was raised as a Lutheran, and I believe in God and consider my faith and involvement with organized religion to be an important part of who I am.": "Gary",
  "Is not the brand of 'double-dealer' stamped on the forehead of every democratic slaveholder? Are not fraud and hypocrisy the religion of the man who calls himself a democrat, and hold his fellow-man in bondage?": "John",
  "When I got religion, I found some work to do to benefit somebody.": "Sojourner",
  "Religion is something we don't talk about, and it is used by uneducated people as a weapon to divide us as opposed to connect with each other.": "Zach",
  "Daredevil's religion makes him unique. He's a vigilante, but he's also a lawyer - and all the while, he believes only God is capable of bringing people to justice.": "Charlie",
  "I was born and raised Catholic, so it's in my blood. I don't go to church... I was born and raised Catholic, which is about the extent of my religion. My parents made one request: that I have my first Holy Communion.": "Tom",
  "Superstition is the only religion of which base souls are capable of.": "Joseph",
  "Religion is of general and public concern, and on its support depend, in great measure, the peace and good order of government, the safety and happiness of the people.": "Samuel",
  "People who dismiss science in favor of religion sometimes confuse the challenge of rigorously understanding the world with a deliberate intellectual exclusion that leads them to mistrust scientists and, to their detriment, what they discover.": "Lisa",
  "If you come out of the gate with a finger pointed, then you really aren't opening the door to any sort of resolution to whatever the problem may be. Whether it's about race or sexual orientation or religion, if you can't empathize with the opposing party, then you can't really meet in the middle.": "Octavia",
  "I am thankful I can see much to admire in all religions.": "Alfred",
  "Religion has caused more harm than any other idea since the beginning of time. There's nothing good I can say about it. People use it as a crutch.": "Larry",
  "Unfortunately, religion, like patriotism, is easy to misuse for political purposes.": "Kjell",
  "For that again, is what all manner of religion essentially is: childish dependency.": "Albert",
  "The people who are teaching religion and not teaching love are missing the message.": "Ziggy",
  "The First Amendment only says 'Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.' It can disrespect all it wants.": "P.",
  "Terrorism should be seen in the light of the country's security and not from the narrow perspective of caste, creed and religion.": "Oscar",
  "Some people think that religion is not essential to society. I do not hold this view. I consider the foundation of religion to be essential to the life and practices of a society.": "B.",
  "Religion is the everlasting dialogue between humanity and God. Art is its soliloquy.": "Franz",
  "Christianity helps us face the music even when we don't like the tune.": "Phillips",
  "Religion is not a department of life it is something that enters into the whole of it.": "Alan",
  "The inner spaces that a good story lets us enter are the old apartments of religion.": "John",
  "It is in our lives and not our words that our religion must be read.": "Thomas",
  "Each religion, by the help of more or less myth, which it takes more or less seriously, proposes some method of fortifying the human soul and enabling it to make its peace with its destiny.": "George",

  "The three great elements of modern civilization, Gun powder, Printing, and the Protestant religion.": "Thomas",
  "Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet.": "Napoleon",
  "There is a heroism in crime as well as in virtue. Vice and infamy have their altars and their religion.": "William",
  "All outward forms of religion are almost useless, and are the causes of endless strife. Believe there is a great power silently working all things for good, behave yourself and never mind the rest.": "Beatrix",
  "Women are oppressed in the east, in the west, in the south, in the north. Women are oppressed inside, outside home, a woman is oppressed in religion, she is oppressed outside religion.": "Taslima",
  "I'm a practicing Christian - and I'm going to keep practicing till I get it right - but I don't feel everyone has to practice the same religion that I do. You have a right to worship who you choose and how you choose to.": "Jane",
  "No white group has founded a major religion on this planet. The major religious were started in the Orient and the Middle East, not in Greece and Rome. I always knew you racists didn't have a prayer.": "Jane",
  "It is the sincere desire of the writer that our citizens should early understand that the genuine source of correct republican principles is the bible, particularly the New Testament or the Christian religion.": "Noah",
  "As a religion, bilingualism is the god that failed. It has led to no fairness, produced no unity, and cost Canadian taxpayers untold millions.": "Stephen",
  "If your religion doesn't teach you the difference between good and evil, your religion is worse than useless.": "Dennis",
  "No, the religion of Jesus is a social religion.": "George",
  "I'm not a big fan of religion for that reason. But I am a true believer in God, and I have great faith, and I think that a spiritual connection with something is a really important part of our experience. That doesn't necessarily have anything to do with the church.": "Shaun",
  "Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that the Ten Commandments are a historical document that contains moral, ethical, and legal truisms that any person of any religion or even an atheist can recognize and appreciate.": "Cliff",
  "Neither the wording of the amendment itself nor common practice challenged the widely held belief that government guaranteed freedom of religion, not freedom from religion.": "Linda",
  "The engine of ancient society was religion but the engine of contemporary society, as I see it, is advertising.": "Kit",
  "Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns.": "Thomas",
  "To have dominion by religion, is to have dominion over men's souls, thus over their very spiritual life, and to use the Divine things, which are in their religion, as the means.": "Emanuel",
  "All around me insisted that my doubts proved only my own ignorance and sinfulness; that they knew by experience they would soon give place to true knowledge, and an advance in religion; and I felt something like indecision.": "Maria",
  "Indian religion has always felt that since the minds, the temperaments and the intellectual affinities of men are unlimited in their variety, a perfect liberty of thought and of worship must be allowed to the individual in his approach to the Infinite.": "Sri",
  "Being a rock star is like being a cult leader - you really have to be in your own religion.": "Courtney",

  "Whoever seeks to set one religion against another seeks to destroy all religion.": "Franklin",
  "The introduction of religious passion into politics is the end of honest politics, and the introduction of politics into religion is the prostitution of true religion.": "Lord",
  "My philosophy is to do the best you can for somebody. Help. It's not just what do you for yourself. It's how you treat people decently. The golden rule. There isn't big anything better than the golden rule. It's in every major religion in one language or another.": "Art",
  "Well, right now, I'm very fascinated with 1920s Berlin. I mean, probably the more interesting thing would be to go to the beginning of civilization or precivilization - like polytheistic times. It would be interesting to see what came before modern religion and culture - what circumstances created the environment or the need for it.": "Natalie",
  "Civil disobedience is not accepted by religion and the state does not accept it and there are many verses in the Holy Book that talk of following the ruler.": "Pope",
  "I hate organized religion. I think you have to love thy neighbor as thyself. I think you have to pick your own God and be true to him. I always say 'him' rather than 'her.' Maybe it's because of my generation, but I don't like the idea of a female God. I see God as a benevolent male.": "Julia",
  "I'm a student of world religion, so to me, it's hugely important to have knowledge and to understand what people are doing.": "Will",
  "I didn't want to be like everybody else. Art was my religion.": "Julian",
  "In fact, I thought that Christianity was very a good and a very valuable thing for us. But after a while, I began to feel that the story that I was told about this religion wasn't perhaps completely whole, that something was left out.": "Chinua",
  "I mean, I went to a Catholic boys' school for a year, but that was to play hockey. Religion class was quite contentious for me.": "Keanu",
  "Anyone with sincere religious beliefs cannot say that all religions are true. That is so illogical it is pathetic. All religion cannot be true because some of them are so diametrically opposed to each other.": "Josh",
  "I believe that there is some spiritual entity that's greater than us. I do not belong to any specific organized religion. I have always believed that, and I believe it even more so now. I believe that someone was listening to me, and someone is giving me an incredibly blessed life.": "Jane",
  "The audience that I try to reach are members of what I call the church alumni association. Now they are people who have not found in institutional religion a God big enough to be God for their world.": "John",
  "Religion is a search for transcendence. But transcendence isn't necessarily sited in an external god, which can be a very unspiritual, unreligious concept.": "Karen",
  "The American way was for commerce, personal relationships, and religion to be voluntary. No one was forced to participate in something he didn't want.": "Harry",
  "Someone once told me that religion is like a knife: You can stab someone with it, or you can slice bread with it.": "Vera",
  "The passion for art is, as for believers, very religious. It unites people, its message is of common humanity. Art has become my religion - others pray in church. It's a banality, but you don't possess art, it possesses you. It's like falling in love.": "Francois",
  "Religion has endured since the dawn of human consciousness precisely because it encompasses so much of being human. No idea has endured so long, gathered up so many disparate needs and wants and feelings, and inspired so many different paths towards understanding it.": "Robert",
  "I'm a great admirer of secularism. At its best, I think it's one of the best things that we have. I don't believe in insinuating religion into conversation. I don't believe in excluding it from conversation. I enjoy the fact that people's innermost thoughts are their own.": "Marilynne",
  "I am obsessive always, even as a child. On one side is this strict orthodox religion, on the other is communism, and I am this little girl pulled between the two. It makes me who I am. It turns me into the kind of person that Freud would have a field day with, for sure.": "Marina",
  "The most stupid religion is Islam.": "Michel",
  "I'm in favour of religion as a tamer of arrogance. For a Greek Orthodox, the idea of God as creator outside the human is not God in God's terms. My God isn't the God of George Bush.": "Nassim",
  "I select a very small number of things to be sceptical about, such as markets, and on these I am hypersceptic. But I want to be fooled by randomness in art. I want the ceremonial of religion; we are made for it.": "Nassim",
  "Religion does not consist in making a noise, yet when the soul is filled with the Spirit of the Lord, sweet, heart-felt praise to God glorifies him.": "Ellen",
  "Do not neglect secret prayer, for it is the soul of religion.": "Ellen",
  "To me, religion is an agreement between a group of people about what God is. Spirituality is a one-on-one relationship.": "Steve",
  "I believe that Catholics involved in politics carry the values of their religion within them, but have the mature awareness and expertise to implement them. The Church will never go beyond its task of expressing and disseminating its values, at least as long as I'm here.": "Pope",
  "I'm not sure about anything as far as religion and spirituality go.": "Tracy",
  "I have always marveled that so many religions exact such revenge against dissenters. It only weakens the appeal of their faith and contradicts any claims they might have made that 'all religions are basically the same.' If all religions were indeed the same, why not let someone be 'converted' to another religion?": "Ravi",
  "I treat politics kind of like my religion. It's something I believe in, but I don't want to have to make a living at it, because if you make a living at it, you somehow become dishonest.": "Jerry",
  "I think the founding fathers believed religion shouldn't interact directly with government.": "Jesse",
  "Animals have come to mean so much in our lives. We live in a fragmented and disconnected culture. Politics are ugly, religion is struggling, technology is stressful, and the economy is unfortunate. What's one thing that we have in our lives that we can depend on? A dog or a cat loving us unconditionally, every day, very faithfully.": "Jon",
  "I come from a Catholic religion, but I'm not Catholic.": "Monica",
  "I wasn't going to great schools, because my parents didn't believe in public education. They wanted the education to be influenced by their religion, so I was going to these halfway education-slash-Christian schools that were like pop-up shop-style education.": "Katy",
  "How can we educators claim credit for understanding, let alone teaching, the 'global mind' without a single course on the impact of religion on every day life?": "Warren",
  "In Elizabethan England or classical Athens... theater was at the center of, not culture, but society and politics and religion and civic engagement. Those things have a different audience.": "Diane",
  "It is wrong to divide the nation white against black, native born against immigrant or one religion against another. It is also wrong to divide people by income. East Germany was not an improvement over South Africa. Obama divides Americans against each other. This is wrong.": "Grover",
  "Women become the objects of rules; they are repressed and lose their rights in the name of religion, or they lose their freedom in the name of tradition, while the state legitimates this foolishness with laws.": "Okky",
  "The moral systems of religion, I think, are super important.": "Bill",
  "If there is a God, it's going to be a whole lot bigger and a whole lot more incomprehensible than anything that any theologian of any religion has ever proposed.": "Richard",
  "Disagreements between incompatible beliefs cannot be settled by reasoned argument because reasoned argument is drummed out of those trained in religion from the cradle.": "Richard",
  "The two ethnic groups that remain fundamentally different from the Han Chinese - in terms of history, culture, language, religion and physical appearance - are the Uighurs and Tibetans. In these two groups, the Han Chinese come face to face with difference.": "Martin",
  "Christianity is the fastest-growing religion in the world; Islam is the second. It's spreading in Asia, Africa, and South America. So the world is in a kind of religious revival, and the atheists are totally flummoxed. They thought they were winning, and now they see that they aren't.": "Dinesh",
  "It is no wonder that advocates of Obamacare blindly push forward with their agenda to force religious Americans to violate their own precepts: in the war between the state and the individual, religion is on the side of the individual and his or her relationship with God. That is why symbolic prayer matters. It is symbolic.": "Ben",
  "I believe that your religion should be between you and whoever your belief is in.": "Zayn",
  "It is clear that rituals and sacrifices can bring people together, and it may well be that a group that does such things has an advantage over one that does not. But it is not clear why a religion has to be involved. Why are gods, souls, an afterlife, miracles, divine creation of the universe, and so on brought in?": "Paul",
  "One man's cult is another man's religion.": "Annie",
  "The cinema has done more for my spiritual life than the church. My ideas of fame, success and beauty all originate from the big screen. Whereas Christian religion is retreating everywhere and losing more and more influence; film has filled the vacuum and supports us with myths and action-controlling images.": "John",
  "Religion may become a fashion as well as anything else; and, when it does become so, it has as little to do, in those who thus hold it, with the heart and the character as any other fashion.": "Benjamin",
  "The clergy earns its living from religion. If your interests are secured through religion, then you will defend your interests first, and religion will become secondary.": "Abdolkarim",
  "Vilification on the grounds of race or religion is always wrong. There's no place for inciting hatred within our Australia society.": "Barry",
  "In Australia, they really want to turn me into a religion. A religion! Can you imagine? The Church of Edna? Oh. I don't want to be over-revered.": "Barry",
  "For Christians, they need to access the power of Jesus and not look at Christianity as a religion. It is our Lord Jesus that makes you change, and Christians need to actualize it and put it into practice.": "Erwin",
  "My religion teaches me that whenever there is distress which one cannot remove, one must fast and pray.": "Mahatma",
  "There are some Christian people who taste and see and enjoy religion in their own souls, and who get at a deeper knowledge of it than books can ever give them, though they should search all their days.": "Charles",
  "How do you sustain yourself when all the old structures people looked to for support - religion, family, ethnic solidarity - are crumbling, or feel so false that you refuse to avail yourself of them? What comes next?": "Adam",
  "No religion makes more use of color than Hinduism, with its blue-skinned gods and peony-lipped goddesses, and even the spring festival of Holi is focused on color: Boys squirt arcs of dyed water on passersby or dump powder, all violently hued, on their marks.": "Hanya",
  "I talk about religion because it's one of the ways human beings find power and belonging. Religion is more than just that - I think faith traditions give us ways to talk about experiences of the numinous, too - but power and belonging are a big part of it.": "Gene",
  "Some would rather pull a handcart across the prairie than bring up the subject of faith and religion to their friends and co-workers. They worry about how they might be perceived or how it might harm their relationship. It doesn't need to be that way because we have a glad message to share, and we have a message of joy.": "Dieter",
  "I've always felt like there are certain politicians that wear their religion on their sleeve in a way that you almost feel is disingenuous. I think that your faith has to be first personal. I struggle with those people that preach something and go back behind closed doors and live differently.": "Nikki",
  "Judaism is a brilliant religion, and the main function of Judaism is to learn and read.": "Leon",
  "A belief is purely an individual matter, and you cannot and must not organize it. If you do, it becomes dead, crystallized; it becomes a creed, a sect, a religion, to be imposed on others.": "Jiddu",
  "'Black Messiah' is a hell of a name for an album. It can easily be misunderstood. Many will think it's about religion. Some will jump to the conclusion that I'm calling myself a Black Messiah. For me, the title is about all of us. It's about the world. It's about an idea we can all aspire to. We should all aspire to be a Black Messiah.": "D'Angelo",
  "The United States cannot and should not discriminate on the basis of religion. The free exercise of religion is at the very heart of our constitutional guarantee for all persons of this country.": "Mike",
  "'Kol Nidrei' is probably the most important prayer in the Jewish religion. It comes on the evening of Yom Kippur. There are so many different renditions of it.": "Itzhak",
  "I grew up in a secular environment, you know, in the '60s and '70s. My mother's family was Catholic, but you know, just very kind of conventionally Catholic. You know, nothing - there was nothing, you know, extreme about their version of religion. And my father was a free spirit, you know? He had no time for religion at all.": "Pawel",
  "While my mother lived, I always felt to a certain degree as if I had somebody who was my superior and who exercised a mysterious protection over me. I belonged to something - I hung to something - there is nothing that has so much reverence and religion in it as affection to parents.": "William",
  "We ministers have undoubtedly failed to connect and apply Christianity to the practical everyday problems of the average man. In this, we have failed to follow in Christ's footsteps. For the religion which He taught and revealed in His own life and ministry was an intensely practical and down-to-earth affair.": "Peter",
  "There is no religion that has a monopoly on bigotry.": "Louis",
  "One of the most important concepts of revealed religion is that of a sacred covenant.": "Russell",
  "Islam is a religion. It is not an ideology. For a Muslim, there is no such thing as to be against modernity. Why should a Muslim not be a modern person? I, as a Muslim, fulfill all the requirements of my religion, and I live in a democratic, social state.": "Recep",
  "I feel like the way I was raised was to be able to see through all the titles in this world - from religion to race.": "The",
  "Religion is a way to make order from chaos, and I think economics is not dissimilar. In religion and in economics, you're trying to figure out the way we perceive the world and move through it, and that's what I like to learn.": "Stephen",
  "India has 2,000,000 gods and worships them all. In religion, all other countries are paupers; India is the only millionaire.": "Mark",
  "Religion was nearly dead because there was no longer real belief in future life; but something was struggling to take its place - service - social service - the ants creed, the bees creed.": "John",
  "When theology erodes and organization crumbles, when the institutional framework of religion begins to break up, the search for a direct experience which people can feel to be religious facilitates the rise of cults.": "Daniel",
  "I found enormous opposition to my religion. It's like if you want to strengthen your biceps, you lift heavy weight, as heavy as you can handle, and work your muscles against resistance until it grows strong. I had to do that with my religion.": "Ricardo",
  "Difference of opinion is advantageous in religion. The several sects perform the office of a Censor - over each other.": "Thomas",
  "I don't feel the need for religion. But I went on a yoga retreat last year and I do believe slightly in the karma thing and just being good and true unto yourself. And I slightly believe that you can attract good and bad to you.": "Imelda",
  "Science and religion are the two most powerful forces in the world. Having them at odds... is not productive.": "E.",
  "Every society and religion has rules, for both have moral laws. And the essence of morality consists, as in art, of drawing the line somewhere.": "Huston",
  "A lot of people, because of my contempt for the false consolations of religion, think of me as a symbolic public opponent of that in extremis. And sometimes that makes me feel a bit alarmed, to be the repository of other people's hope.": "Christopher",
  "If you grow up in a very strong religion like Catholicism you certainly cultivate in yourself a certain taste for the intensity of ideas.": "Brian",
  "I think Christianity is the same as Buddhism and Hinduism - whenever a religion begins to say that these are the things you have to do to be loved by God, you have a religion.": "Erwin",
  "It's simply untrue that religion provides the only framework for a universal morality.": "Sam",
  "It is not our sexual preferences, the color of our skin, the language we speak, nor the religion we practice that creates friction, hatred and wars amongst in society. It is our words and the words of our leaders that can create that disparity.": "Yehuda",
  "The idea of an ordered and elegant universe is a lovely one. One worth clinging to. But you don't need religion to appreciate the ordered existence. It's not just an idea, it's reality. We're discovering the hidden orders of the universe every day.": "Adam",
  "Commodities such as gold and silver have a world market that transcends national borders, politics, religions, and race. A person may not like someone else's religion, but he'll accept his gold.": "Robert",
  "I remember at one point being in fellowship, and everyone used to wear the fish symbol; it said you were a Christian. So I asked my father, 'Dad, why don't you wear that at work?' And he said, 'Your religion should be in your actions.' He set a great, great example.": "Hugh",
  "I want people to have a good impression of Israel. I don't feel like I'm an ambassador for my country, but I do talk about Israel a lot - I enjoy telling people about where I come from and my religion.": "Gal",
  "Religion and political cartoons, as you may have heard, make a difficult couple, ever since that day of 2005, when a bunch of cartoonists in Denmark drew cartoons that had repercussions all over the world - demonstrations, fatwa, they provoked violence. People died in the violence.": "Patrick",
  "Politicians use religion, and they get their troops riled up with religion.": "Daron",
  "Such is the feebleness of humanity, such is its perversity, that doubtless it is better for it to be subject to all possible superstitions, as long as they are not murderous, than to live without religion.": "Voltaire",
  "Religion is a matter of the heart. No physical inconvenience can warrant abandonment of one's own religion.": "Mahatma",
  "Every formula of every religion has in this age of reason, to submit to the acid test of reason and universal assent.": "Mahatma",
  "My parents taught me never to judge others based on whom they love, what color their skin is, or their religion.": "Taylor",
  "If you have a particular faith or religion, that is good. But you can survive without it.": "Dalai",
  "It is often said by religious people that without its framework, there is no sense of right or wrong. My view is that religion comes after ethics.": "Salman",
  "I never thought of myself as a writer about religion until a religion came after me.": "Salman",
  "You know what the fastest growing religion in America is? Statism. The growing reliance on government.": "Marco",
  "If the grandfather of the grandfather of Jesus had known what was hidden within him, he would have stood humble and awe-struck before his soul.": "Khalil",
  "Religion was instituted to make us happy in this life and in the other. What must we do to be happy in the life to come? Be just.": "Voltaire",
  "I was always respectful of people who were deeply religious because I always felt that if they gave themselves to it, then it had to be important to them. But if you can go through life without it, that's OK, too. It's whatever suits you.": "Clint",
  "Just as the soul fills the body, so God fills the world. Just as the soul bears the body, so God endures the world. Just as the soul sees but is not seen, so God sees but is not seen. Just as the soul feeds the body, so God gives food to the world.": "Marcus",
  "I'm religiously opposed to religion.": "Victor",
  "The intersection of religion and world politics has often been a bloody crossroads.": "Elliott",
  "There is nothing in our book, the Koran, that teaches us to suffer peacefully. Our religion teaches us to be intelligent.": "Malcolm",
  "I don't think Romney is wacky at all, but religion makes intelligent people say and do wacky things, believe and affirm crazy things. Left on his own, Romney would never have said something like the Garden Of Eden was in Missouri, and will be again.": "Christopher",
  "My children, to the extent that they have found religion, have found it from me, in that I insist on at least a modicum of religious education for them.": "Christopher",
  "Religion is not going to come up with any new arguments.": "Christopher",
  "My first dissatisfaction has always been with religion.": "Marilyn",
  "Religion enables us to ignore nothingness and get on with the jobs of life.": "John",
  "Happiness is a mystery, like religion, and should never be rationalised.": "Gilbert",

  "Religion can never reform mankind because religion is slavery.": "Robert",
  "Every religion in the world has denounced every other religion as a fraud. That proves to me that they all tell the truth - about others.": "Robert",
  "If you believe, you believe; if you're faithful, you're faithful. I don't care what your religion is. The same if you're agnostic. That should be accepted, too.": "Ridley",
  "The spirituality that I experience sometimes touches on religion, in that I resonate with the thread of continuity that permeates through all religions. But in terms of it being a concretized, organized part of my life, it's not.": "Alanis",
  "People in general are equally horrified at hearing the Christian religion doubted, and at seeing it practiced.": "Samuel",
  "Politics is the most important of the civil activities and has its own field of action, which is not that of religion.": "Pope",
  "The same thing which is now called Christian religion existed among the ancients. They have begun to call 'Christian' the true religion which existed before.": "Saint",
  "Most people don't want to talk about politics and religion. They say, 'Let's talk about something else.'": "Prince",
  "I see religion as a storehouse of lots of really good ideas that a secular world should look at, raid, and learn from.": "Alain",
  "Art, like religion, arises from the spirit, but alas, the formalizing of spiritual life all too often ends in hypocrisy.": "Michael",
  "Religion has become so many different things. Religion is an economic thing for some people. Religion is a gun.": "Ziggy",
  "For me, tribalism and religion are basically the big reasons we're in trouble. Patriotism, tribalism, and religion.": "George",
  "Religion is essentially the art and the theory of the remaking of man. Man is not a finished creation.": "Edmund",
  "Myself, first of all, I am a Jew. And that is the most important thing for me.": "Ariel",
  "The concept of God in America is very different than it is in England. Because we see the horrendous outcome of religion as being an American thing, in which the name of God has been hijacked by a gang of psychopaths and bullies and homophobes, and the name of God has been used for their own twisted agendas.": "Nick",
  "Without the emotion of the beautiful, the sublime, the mysterious, there is no art, no religion, no literature.": "John",
  "I grew up very religious, and I don't have a great relationship with religion.": "Brad",

  "Wealth, religion, military victory have more rhetorical than efficacious worth.": "George",
  "Anti-religious sneers are a hallmark of perpetual adolescents.": "Camille",
  "Religion is a very personal thing for me. Religion has its good moments and its poor moments.": "Elie",
  "I want clean water and clean air and conservation... that's not what extreme environmentalists are all about. For them, it is a religion. They believe in trees and animals, not God.": "Roger",
  "But the whole point of the Sixties was that you had to take people as they were. If you came in with us you left your class, and colour, and religion behind, that was what the Sixties was all about.": "Michael",
  "Eradicating a religion of kindness is, I think, a terrible thing for the Chinese to attempt.": "Martin",
  "You might sooner get lightning out of incense smoke than true action or passion out of your modern English religion.": "John",
  "To see clearly is poetry, prophecy and religion all in one.": "John",
  "In politics, religion and other areas of culture, people disagree on the worth of competing ideas. There is no equivalent to the scientific method that can determine in a robust way which ideas match the real world, and which ones can be ruled out. So conflicting ideologies persist indefinitely.": "Nathan",
  "All humanity is passion; without passion, religion, history, novels, art would be ineffectual.": "Honore",
  "Passion is universal humanity. Without it religion, history, romance and art would be useless.": "Honore",
  "I have a funny relationship with religion. I'm a big believer in ritualistic behavior as long as it doesn't hurt anybody. But I'm not a big fan of rules. And yet, we cannot live in a world without order.": "Madonna",
  "A man has no religion who has not slowly and painfully gathered one together, adding to it, shaping it; and one's religion is never complete and final, it seems, but must always be undergoing modification.": "D.",
  "Unless we place our religion and our treasure in the same thing, religion will always be sacrificed.": "Epictetus",
  "The only real shaming I've ever experienced has been from other gay people when I reveal my politics or my religion.": "Milo",
  "My sense of religion is Einstein's sense of relativity. I don't believe in God. I believe that energy never dies. So the possibility exists that you might be breathing in some other form of Moses or Buddha or Muhammad or Bobby Kennedy or Roosevelt or Martin Luther King or Jesus.": "Mandy",
  "I love the idea of the teachings of Jesus Christ and the beautiful stories about it, which I loved in Sunday school and I collected all the little stickers and put them in my book. But the reality is that organised religion doesn't seem to work. It turns people into hateful lemmings and it's not really compassionate.": "Elton",
  "Counting is the religion of this generation it is its hope and its salvation.": "Gertrude",
  "Rock n' roll is our religion, and we will continue to lose disciples as we go, but we pick up the fallen flag and keep moving forward, bringing forth the good news that our heroes have helped create, their bodies lost, but their spirits and their good work everlasting.": "Steven",
  "Liberalism is a religion. Its tenets cannot be proved, its capacity for waste and destruction demonstrated. But it affords a feeling of spiritual rectitude at little or no cost.": "David",
  "So far as the government is concerned, there is only one holy book, which is the constitution of India. My government will not tolerate or accept any discrimination based on caste, creed and religion.": "Narendra",
  "A political party cannot have a religion. Only individuals can. Otherwise, you'd be exploiting religion, and religion is so supreme that it cannot be exploited or taken advantage of.": "Recep",
  "Our religion is itself profoundly sad - a religion of universal anguish, and one which, because of its very catholicity, grants full liberty to the individual and asks no better than to be celebrated in each man's own language - so long as he knows anguish and is a painter.": "Charles",
  "Every major religion today is a winner in the Darwinian struggle waged among cultures, and none ever flourished by tolerating its rivals.": "E.",
  "I see no way out of the problems that organized religion and tribalism create other than humans just becoming more honest and fully aware of themselves.": "E.",
  "I was raised Catholic, but my father's people were Methodist, so we went to both churches.": "Aaron",
  "I grew up in a secular suburban Jewish household where we only observed the religion on very specific times like a funeral or a Bar Mitzvah.": "Jesse",
  "And I have no doubt that every new example will succeed, as every past one has done, in showing that religion and Government will both exist in greater purity, the less they are mixed together.": "James",
  "You should always take a religion at its best and not at its worst, from its highest teachings and not from the lowest practices of some of its adherents.": "Annie",
  "Man is ever searching for the source whence he has come, searching for the life which is upwelling within him, immortal, nay, eternal and divine; and every religion is the answer from the Universal Spirit to the seeking spirits of men that came forth from Him.": "Annie",
  "Martyrdom is evidence only of a man's honesty - it is no evidence that he is not mistaken. Men have suffered martyrdom for all sorts of opinions in politics and in religion yet they could not therefore have all been in the right although they could give no stronger evidence that they believed themselves in the right. ": "Lysander",
  "Major forces that have contributed to the evolution of philanthropy in India in the pre-modern era have mainly been driven by religion, family, and society. The Hindu teaching of 'daan' or 'giving' is present in different ways in almost every celebration or ritual.": "Shiv",
  "I still love the theology of the Mormon religion and think it is a wonderful way to grow up.": "Katherine",
  "The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion or ethnic background, is that we all believe we are above-average drivers.": "Dave",
  "As Americans, we're not sure we share values. We're sometimes even afraid to use the word 'values.' We talk about teaching ethics in schools - people say, 'What ethics? Whose ethics? Maybe we can't.' And they confuse that with teaching of religion.": "Rudy",
  "One person's religion is another person's cult.": "Philip",
  "He who has religion will speak poetry. But philosophy is the tool with which to seek and discover religion.": "Karl",
  "My grandparents - my mom's parents - they're Jewish. But nobody ever pushed religion onto us. It wasn't something I ever grew up with.": "David",
  "We have this idea in our minds that there's this separation of church and state in America, which I think is a good thing. And we extend that to our politics - not just church and state, but it's also there's a separation of religion and politics. But of course there isn't.": "Stephen",
  "Themes of redemption, temptation, and faith don't necessarily apply directly to religion. A lot of people find faith in their lives outside of God and still deal with notions of temptation and redemption that aren't religious.": "Will",
  "I think if you say that art and politics, or religion and politics, mustn't mix, don't mix, that is itself a political statement. Even if you are writing a 19th-century novel where the money comes from a plantation in the Caribbean and you don't talk about that, that itself is a political thing.": "Mohsin",
  "There's nothing funnier than religion. Try explaining it to a kid. I had it all wrong when I was a kid.": "Bonnie",
  "It is my sincere hope that every person in India will experience true freedom of faith, regardless of religion.": "Trent",
  "I grew up with the religion of 'Star Wars,' frankly. That's when I realized there is something bigger out there... and it's called The Force.": "Trey",
  "Out of all the ridiculous religion stories - which are greatly, wonderfully ridiculous - the silliest one I've ever heard is, 'Yeah, there's this big, giant universe, and it's expanding, and it's all going to collapse on itself, and we're all just here, just 'cuz. Just 'cuz.' That to me, is the most ridiculous explanation ever.": "Trey",
  "I love religion and have contemplated going back to school to get a world religion degree.": "Jada",
  "When people feel a certain religion claims to have all the answers, that's what turns them off.": "Matisyahu",
  "In the early days I had a very black-and-white view of everything. I think that's kind of natural for anyone who's just embraced Islam - or any religion - as a convert. It was important for me to duck out of the fast and furious life I'd been living as a pop star. I was in a different mood.": "Cat",
  "I won't take my religion from any man who never works except with his mouth.": "Carl",
  "The enemy of science is not religion. Religion comes in endless shapes and forms... The true enemy is the substitution of thought, reflection, and curiosity with dogma.": "Frans",
  "The secularists in Turkey haven't underestimated religion, they just made the mistake of believing they could control it with the power of the army alone.": "Orhan",
  "I think quite a bit of organized religion has become big business. Jesus Christ never sold the word of God. He never gave a sermon and then said, 'For $8.99, you can buy the CD.'": "Ving",
  "Religion is not merely the opium of the masses, it's the cyanide.": "Tom",
  "People still kill in the name of religion. We haven't evolved to the point where we're one tribe called humans.": "Rachel",
  "Disturbances in society are never more fearful than when those who are stirring up the trouble can use the pretext of religion to mask their true designs.": "Denis",
  "You can believe what you want religiously. Religion is one thing, but science, provable science, is something else.": "Bill",
  "I remember the first time going to St. Jude. I didn't like going there because the children were ill, and it just broke my heart. It makes you test your religion when you see something like that. But the Lord doesn't want just old people. You know, He wants some young people, too, and good people. He takes care of them. He takes care of them.": "Lee",
  "I ask you to pray for me, for once age has overtaken us, we find consolation only in religion.": "Paul",
  "Genghis Khan decreed religious tolerance for all of his conquered peoples. So I think he definitely would approve of our constitutional protections of freedom of religion. I think he would also approve of the way the U.S. has been able to attract talented people from all over the world.": "Amy",
  "The Rosicrucians teach that all great religions have been given to the people among whom they are found, by Divine Intelligences who designed each system of worship to suit the needs of the race or nation to whom it was given. A primitive people cannot respond to a lofty and sublime religion, and vice versa.": "Max",
  "I never close a door on any other religion. Most of the time, some part of it makes sense to me. I don't believe everyone has to chant just because I chant. I believe all religion is about touching something inside of yourself.": "Tina",
  "You can look at Bad Religion, and, really, almost everything I've ever done was an exercise in creativity. I've always had a desire to challenge and question authority, and that's where the fire inside comes from. I challenged authority out of a desire to make things better, not to be nihilistic about it.": "Greg",
  "I've never treated anyone badly or in a discriminatory way based on their gender, race, religion or sexuality - period.": "Mel",
  "Religion and politics hit nerves. There's a lot of anger about a lot of things. It's not easily resolved. I guess that's what wars are about. Wars are about prejudice and fear. Hit first before you get hit. Believe me, I know.": "Mel",
  "Religion is never the problem it's the people who use it to gain power.": "Julian",
  "Much to the chagrin of the staunchly secular among us, religion shows no sign of going away. Predictions of the demise of religion, faith, tradition - and even God - have consistently been proven wrong.": "Hamza",
  "The acquisition of knowledge - knowledge of both the world and of their own religion - will inoculate young people against extremist ideologies.": "Hamza",
  "In every religion I can think of, there exists some variation on the theme of abandoning the settled life and walking one's way to godliness. The Hindu sadhu, the pilgrims of Compostela walking past their sins, the circumambulators of the Buddhist kora, the haj.": "Robyn",
  "Religion is the last refuge of human savagery.": "Alfred",
  "Religion is run by thought police. 'Obey. Listen. This is what you do. Don't ask questions. Go die for your country.' The spirituality says, 'Okay, you can die for your country, but know what you're doing while you're doing it.'": "Tommy",
  "Our civilization, such as it is, was shaped by religion, and the men who aspire to public office anyplace in the free world must make obeisance to God or risk immediate opprobrium.": "Frank",
  "We first fought... in the name of religion, then Communism, and now in the name of drugs and terrorism. Our excuses for global domination always change.": "Serj",

  "Religion and political expediency go beautifully hand in hand.": "Friedrich",
  "In order to have faith, or follow any other organized religion, I'd have to suspend a degree of disbelief.": "Pete",
  "What's unique about the Mormon Church is that it encourages inquiry. I really do think my research and religion are all on the same page. I never could have come up with the notion of disruptive innovations, which went against a lot of conventional wisdom, if I hadn't been raised to always be asking questions.": "Clayton",
  "Worship means reverence and humility it means revering your real self and humbling delusions.": "Bodhidharma",
  "Violence against women in all its forms is a human rights violation. It's not something that any culture, religion or tradition propagates.": "Michelle",
  "It's very difficult to talk about religion in Iran because religion has gotten so mixed up with politics.": "Asghar",
  "My four sons all knew I was a Jew, but they were allowed to be whatever they wanted to be. The only thing important to me was that they be good people who help other people, because all religion should try to make you a better person and a more caring person. Whenever religion does that for you, it's a good religion.": "Kirk",
  "These days politics, religion, media seem to get all mixed up. Television became the new religion a long time back and the media has taken over.": "Van",
  "Every fundamentalist movement I've studied in Judaism, Christianity and Islam is convinced at some gut, visceral level that secular liberal society wants to wipe out religion.": "Karen",
  "Compassion is not a popular virtue. Very often when I talk to religious people, and mention how important it is that compassion is the key, that it's the sine-qua-non of religion, people look kind of balked, and stubborn sometimes, as much to say, what's the point of having religion if you can't disapprove of other people?": "Karen",
  "My family was Jehovah's Witnesses, which is a really tough religion. It kind of deterred me from religion for a long time. They still practice, but I don't. But I always remained spiritual, and had a belief that there is a God. I'm trying to find my way, you know?": "Ja",
  "You can't write about the past and ignore religion. It was such a fundamental, mind-shaping, driving force for pre-modern societies. I'm very interested in what religion does to us - its capacity to create love and empathy or hatred and violence.": "Geraldine",

  "Every man, either to his terror or consolation, has some sense of religion.": "Heinrich",

  "For one who feels compelled, as I do, to accept the existence of the Master Architect, it is important to examine his handiwork for the light it throws on him and on his program for his children.

They are devoted. They compete to best themselves as much if not more than they compete to best others. Champions are not just athletes.": "Simon",
  "All things are subject to interpretation whichever interpretation prevails at a given time is a function of power and not truth.": "Friedrich",

  "Peace is a journey of a thousand miles and it must be taken one step at a time.": "Lyndon",
  "You can't please everyone. When you're too focused on living up to other people's standards, you aren't spending enough time raising your own. Some people may whisper, complain and judge. But for the most part, it's all in your head. People care less about your actions than you think. Why? They have their own problems!": "Kris",

  "The connection to place, to the land, the wind, the sun, stars, the moon... it sounds romantic, but it's true - the visceral experience of motion, of moving through time on some amazing machine - a few cars touch on it, but not too many compared to motorcycles. I always felt that any motorcycle journey was special.": "Antoine",
  "All the world's a stage, and all the men and women merely players: they have their exits and their entrances; and one man in his time plays many parts, his acts being seven ages.": "William",

  "I'm not a sad person, upset the whole time, but I seem to be quite emotional.": "Freddie",
  "I don't believe that if you do good, good things will happen. Everything is completely accidental and random. Sometimes bad things happen to very good people and sometimes good things happen to bad people. But at least if you try to do good things, then you're spending your time doing something worthwhile.": "Helen",
  "Time management is an oxymoron. Time is beyond our control, and the clock keeps ticking regardless of how we lead our lives. Priority management is the answer to maximizing the time we have.": "John",
  "Do the one thing you think you cannot do. Fail at it. Try again. Do better the second time. The only people who never tumble are those who never mount the high wire. This is your moment. Own it.": "Oprah",
  "When you take a flower in your hand and really look at it, it's your world for the moment. I want to give that world to someone else. Most people in the city rush around so, they have no time to look at a flower. I want them to see it whether they want to or not.": "Georgia",

  "Humans have a light side and a dark side, and it's up to us to choose which way we're going to live our lives. Even if you start out on the dark side, it doesn't mean you have to continue your journey that way. You always have time to turn it around.": "Taraji",
  "By taking the time to stop and appreciate who you are and what you've achieved - and perhaps learned through a few mistakes, stumbles and losses - you actually can enhance everything about you.

  "I learned that we can do anything, but we can't do everything... at least not at the same time. So think of your priorities not in terms of what activities you do, but when you do them. Timing is everything.": "Dan",
  "Golf is deceptively simple and endlessly complicated it satisfies the soul and frustrates the intellect. It is at the same time rewarding and maddening - and it is without a doubt the greatest game mankind has ever invented.": "Arnold",

  "You are your greatest asset. Put your time, effort and money into training, grooming, and encouraging your greatest asset.": "Tom",
  "Change is a continuous process. You cannot assess it with the static yardstick of a limited time frame. When a seed is sown into the ground, you cannot immediately see the plant. You have to be patient. With time, it grows into a large tree. And then the flowers bloom, and only then can the fruits be plucked.": "Mamata",

  "I learned a long time ago that some people would rather die than forgive. It's a strange truth, but forgiveness is a painful and difficult process. It's not something that happens overnight. It's an evolution of the heart.": "Sue",
  "With each new day in Africa, a gazelle wakes up knowing he must outrun the fastest lion or perish. At the same time, a lion stirs and stretches, knowing he must outrun the fastest gazelle or starve. It's no different for the human race. Whether you consider yourself a gazelle or a lion, you have to run faster than others to survive.": "Mohammed",
  "It's been proven by quite a few studies that plants are good for our psychological development. If you green an area, the rate of crime goes down. Torture victims begin to recover when they spend time outside in a garden with flowers.

  "In 1985, I was living with my sister in Virginia, and since I was still in high school, I worked at McDonald's to save money to get an abortion. It sounds really terrible, but it was the best decision I ever made. It was the first time I took responsibility for my actions. I messed up, had sex without contraception, and got pregnant at 15.": "Kathleen",
  "There's a time in your life where you're not quite sure where you are. You think everything's perfect, but it's not perfect... Then one day you wake up and you can't quite picture yourself in the situation you're in. But the secret is, if you can picture yourself doing anything in life, you can do it.": "Tom",

  "I'm a very positive person, but this whole concept of having to always be nice, always smiling, always happy, that's not real. It was like I was wearing a mask. I was becoming this perfectly chiselled sculpture, and that was bad. That took a long time to understand.": "Alicia",

  "I have short goals - to get better every day, to help my teammates every day - but my only ultimate goal is to win an NBA championship. It's all that matters. I dream about it. I dream about it all the time, how it would look, how it would feel. It would be so amazing.": "LeBron",
  "Mental prayer in my opinion is nothing else than an intimate sharing between friends it means taking time frequently to be alone with Him who we know loves us. The important thing is not to think much but to love much and so do that which best stirs you to love. Love is not great delight but desire to please God in everything.": "Saint",
  "Encouragement to others is something everyone can give. Somebody needs what you have to give. It may not be your money it may be your time. It may be your listening ear. It may be your arms to encourage. It may be your smile to uplift. Who knows?": "Joel",

  "Over time, naturally, you lose your innocence from gaining knowledge. You can't be innocent forever, but there's something in innocence you need to regain to be creative.": "Albert",
  "I don't think you should try to be anything you're not. If you're not smiling all the time or always happy - I don't think it matters. If you're having bad day, show you're having a bad day. Don't try to put up something that's fake.": "Elle",

  "If someone decides they're not going to be happy, it's not your problem. You don't have to spend your time and energy trying to cheer up someone who has already decided to stay in a bad mood. Believe it or not, you can actually hurt people by playing into their self-pity.": "Joyce",
  "I believe in the brotherhood of man, all men, but I don't believe in brotherhood with anybody who doesn't want brotherhood with me. I believe in treating people right, but I'm not going to waste my time trying to treat somebody right who doesn't know how to return the treatment.": "Malcolm",
  "People spend too much time finding other people to blame, too much energy finding excuses for not being what they are capable of being, and not enough energy putting themselves on the line, growing out of the past, and getting on with their lives.": "J.",

  "We act as if that being of a man or that being of a woman is actually an internal reality or something that is simply true about us, a fact about us, but actually it's a phenomenon that is being produced all the time and reproduced all the time, so to say gender is performative is to say that nobody really is a gender from the start.": "Judith",

  "At the end of your life, you will never regret not having passed one more test, not winning one more verdict or not closing one more deal. You will regret time not spent with a husband, a friend, a child, or a parent.": "Barbara",
  "Time flies like an arrow - but fruit flies like a banana.": "Terry",
  "Don't let the fear of the time it will take to accomplish something stand in the way of your doing it. The time will pass anyway we might just as well put that passing time to the best possible use. ": "Earl",

  "I write little quotes all the time to help encourage people to come together, like this one: 'If fate happens to toss you a lightbulb, use it to light the path of others, for they will use theirs to light the path of you. With your light together with mine, it's two times as bright and twice as strong.'": "Matthew",
  "The world is like a reverse casino. In a casino, if you gamble long enough, you're certainly going to lose. But in the real world, where the only thing you're gambling is, say, your time or your embarrassment, then the more stuff you do, the more you give luck a chance to find you.": "Scott",
  "There are no secrets that time does not reveal.": "Jean",
  "We didn't lose the game we just ran out of time.": "Vince",
  "The demons you have are what motivate you to make your art. This is what drives the detective, this is what drives the painter, this is what drives the writer: a conflicting urge to forget pain and at the same time remember it and fight for some kind of justice.

  "There comes a point in your life when you realize how quickly time goes by, and how quickly it has gone. Then it really speeds up exponentially. With that, I think you start to put a lot of things into context; you start to see how huge the world is, and really, the universe.": "Michael",
  "It is weird. People will say, 'Oh my God, I love you.' And I'll say, 'Oh, that's so sweet. Thank you.'

  "I think the kids in school that laughed at the clothes that we wore and the house that we lived in, and then my mother had to cut hair... I think that was a good motivator.

  "Time flies. It's up to you to be the navigator.": "Robert",
  "Time is long but life is short.": "Stevie",
  "For years my wedding ring has done its job. It has led me not into temptation. It has reminded my husband numerous times at parties that it's time to go home. It has been a source of relief to a dinner companion. It has been a status symbol in the maternity ward.": "Erma",

  "Sometimes you have to accept you can't win all the time.": "Lionel",
  "I can be fascinated with very little things. The clouds stimulate my imagination, and sometimes I just sit somewhere and go on dreaming for a long time. Your head is also a computer. When you're dreaming, you are simulating a world in which you are living.": "Theo",

  "The only time a woman really succeeds in changing a man is when he is a baby.": "Natalie",
  "History is not everything, but it is a starting point. History is a clock that people use to tell their political and cultural time of day. It is a compass they use to find themselves on the map of human geography. It tells them where they are but, more importantly, what they must be.": "John",
  "When the fishbowl gets too small, it's time to pack up and leave and jump into the lake or ocean.": "Travie",

  "In time of difficulties, we must not lose sight of our achievements.": "Mao",
  "My life at home gives me absolute joy. There are some days when, as soon as you've finished cooking breakfast and cleaning up the kitchen, it's time to start lunch, and by the time you've done that, you're doing dinner and thinking, 'There has to be a menu we can order from.'": "Julia",
  "I don't get jealous of people. Jealousy is such a waste of time because you're jealous of them, and they go about their lives and have a wonderful time, so what's the point?": "Joy",
  "What you want in a mentor is someone who truly cares for you and who will look after your interests and not just their own. When you do come across the right person to mentor you, start by showing them that the time they spend with you is worthwhile.": "Vivek",

  "The older we get, the swifter time seems to pass and the quicker memories seem to fade.": "Brian",
  "Time itself comes in drops.": "William",
  "Life is difficult. Not just for me or other ALS patients. Life is difficult for everyone. Finding ways to make life meaningful and purposeful and rewarding, doing the activities that you love and spending time with the people that you love - I think that's the meaning of this human experience.": "Steve",
  "People change with time. There are things that happened to a person in his childhood and years later they seem to him alien and strange. I am trying to decipher that child. Sometimes he is a stranger to me. When you think about when you were 14, don't you feel a certain alienation?": "Gunter",
  "When things are bad, it's the best time to reinvent yourself.": "George",
  "Anything I've ever said, I certainly was feeling at the time.": "Eminem",
  "Being a survivor doesn't mean being strong - it's telling people when you need a meal or a ride, company, whatever. It's paying attention to heart wisdom, feelings, not living a role, but having a unique, authentic life, having something to contribute, finding time to love and laugh. All these things are qualities of survivors.": "Bernie",

  "Time and memory are true artists they remould reality nearer to the heart's desire.": "John",
  "In this hectic life, we have no time to take care of ourselves, hence massage is needed for rejuvenation and stress reduction.

  "Projects are usually undertaken to either solve a problem or take advantage of an opportunity. The probability that the project - even if precisely executed - will complete on time, on budget, and on performance is typically small. Project management is utilized to increase this probability. So in a sense, project management is risk management.": "Bruce",
  "It has been said that time heals all wounds. I don't agree. The wounds remain. Time - the mind, protecting its sanity - covers them with some scar tissue and the pain lessens, but it is never gone.": "Rose",
  "It is a mistake to look too far ahead. Only one link of the chain of destiny can be handled at a time.": "Winston",
  "What a costume designer does is a cross between magic and camouflage. We create the illusion of changing the actors into what they are not. We ask the public to believe that every time they see a performer on the screen, he's become a different person.": "Edith",
  "Don't waste time on jealousy. Sometimes you're ahead, sometimes you're behind.": "Mary",
  "We must use time creatively.": "Martin",
  "I like to be lazy. I do like to be busy and really active, but when that's done, you can be sure I will be a lazy boy. I like to take time and relax and enjoy life.": "Olivier",
  "I think we all have our own personality, unique and distinctive, and at the same time, I think that our own unique and distinctive personality blends with the wind, with the footsteps in the street, with the noises around the corner, and with the silence of memory, which is the great producer of ghosts.": "Octavio",
  "I don't believe we have a professional self Monday through Friday and a real self the rest of the time. It is all professional, and it is all personal.": "Sheryl",

  "Optimism doesn't wait on facts. It deals with prospects. Pessimism is a waste of time.": "Norman",
  "Was I always going to be here? No I was not. I was going to be homeless at one time, a taxi driver, truck driver, or any kind of job that would get me a crust of bread. You never know what's going to happen.": "Morgan",
  "Through consciousness, our minds have the power to change our planet and ourselves. It is time we heed the wisdom of the ancient indigenous people and channel our consciousness and spirit to tend the garden and not destroy it.": "Bruce",

  "If you could get all the people in the organization rowing in the same direction, you could dominate any industry, in any market, against any competition, at any time.": "Patrick",
  "Drugs are a waste of time. They destroy your memory and your self-respect and everything that goes along with with your self-esteem. They're no good at all.": "Kurt",
  "Every time I think I know what's right and wrong, I end up being wrong. All I want to do is explore. I want to see what people would do. I say, 'What would this person do in this situation?' and I write it down. I'm not writing manifestos of my political views.": "Carolyn",
  "Going on with life, it only gets more and more intense as time goes by - and the challenges only multiply.": "Martha",
  "Technology gives us the facilities that lessen the barriers of time and distance - the telegraph and cable, the telephone, radio, and the rest.": "Emily",
  "We name time when we say: every thing has its time. This means: everything which actually is, every being comes and goes at the right time and remains for a time during the time allotted to it. Every thing has its time.": "Martin",

  "Everything that happens once can never happen again. But everything that happens twice will surely happen a third time.": "Paulo",
  "Ten percent of the big fish still remain. There are still some blue whales. There are still some krill in Antarctica. There are a few oysters in Chesapeake Bay. Half the coral reefs are still in pretty good shape, a jeweled belt around the middle of the planet. There's still time, but not a lot, to turn things around.": "Sylvia",
  "The moral values, ethical codes and laws that guide our choices in normal times are, if anything, even more important to help us navigate the confusing and disorienting time of a disaster.": "Sheri",
  "I believe that filmmaking - as, probably, is everything - is a game you should play with all your cards, and all your dice, and whatever else you've got. So, each time I make a movie, I give it everything I have. I think everyone should, and I think everyone should do everything they do that way.": "Francis",
  "My success has been something I've worked a long time at and it's been a gradual process. I compare it to the idea of someone losing a lot of weight over a period of a few years. You don't really notice the weight loss overall but if you compare photos from then and now there's a big difference.": "Ray",
  "There are so many forms of love. Spending time with friends, love stories. I enjoy showing my love by baking a cake for somebody and writing his or her name on it, and seeing his or her reaction. I love to offer flowers, too!": "Pom",

  "As you grow older, you learn a few things. One of them is to actually take the time you've allotted for vacation.": "John",
  "I believe in God, who made of one blood all nations that on earth do dwell.

  "Life is a series of steps. Things are done gradually. Once in a while there is a giant step, but most of the time we are taking small, seemingly insignificant steps on the stairway of life.": "Ralph",
  "Each of us should think of the future. Every puff on a cigarette is another tick closer to a time bomb of terrible consequences. Christopher Hitchens didn't care about the consequences of smoking cigarettes. Tragically, he died of throat cancer in December 2011.": "Ray",
  "You can assume that the leaf you see let go of a branch and fall towards the ground has never been considered by any being but yourself. Catch it in your hand - or, even better, keep walking until one falls into your reach naturally - and it will have spent its whole time on the planet without ever touching the ground, only because of you.": "Eliot",
  "The most valuable live thing for me is when people look like they're having a good time.": "Grimes",

  "To achieve great things, two things are needed; a plan, and not quite enough time.": "Leonard",

  "You can't just ask customers what they want and then try to give that to them. By the time you get it built, they'll want something new.": "Steve",
  "I believe in dressing for the occasion. There's a time for sweater, sneakers and Levis and a time for the full-dress jazz.": "Ginger",
  "I really don't think in the past. I sit down with many friends at dinner, and they like to talk about the good old days. I'm respectful of the good old days, but I find myself spending very little time reminiscing. I'm really looking forward.": "Donald",

  "The beauty of our country is that when it was founded that they took some time to lay out civil liberties in the first 10 Amendments - the Bill of Rights. I'm a firm believer in those civil liberties and the ability to have your own opinion.": "Aaron",
  "Anything that's not positive, I don't have the energy to focus on it. Anything that's not going in the right direction, I don't have the time or the energy.": "DMX",
  "Imagination makes us aware of limitless possibilities. How many of us haven't pondered the concept of infinity or imagined the possibility of time travel? In one of her poems, Emily Bronte likens imagination to a constant companion, but I prefer to think of it as a built-in entertainment system.": "Alexandra",
  "If you have a chance to accomplish something that will make things better for people coming behind you, and you don't do that, you are wasting your time on this earth.": "Roberto",

  "The two most important requirements for major success are: first, being in the right place at the right time, and second, doing something about it.": "Ray",
  "'Back To Love' is a way of letting people know that sometimes you get caught up in trying to be successful in school or in your social life, and it's a reminder not to forget that each day people are getting older.

  "The pressure on young chefs today is far greater than ever before in terms of social skills, marketing skills, cooking skills, personality and, more importantly, delivering on the plate. So you need to be strong. Physically fit. So my chefs get weighed every time they come into the kitchen.": "Gordon",
  "Now, you lose something in your life, or you come into a conflict, and there's gonna come a time that you're gonna know: There was a reason for that. And at the end of your life, all the things you thought were periods, they turn out to be commas. There was never a full stop in any of it.": "Matthew",
  "It's always good to see the world; always good to see new places. When I'm sitting at home, one of the great things is when my daughter and I watch TV, and when she sees or hears about a place for the first time, I tell her, 'Daddy's been there!'": "Roman",
  "There was a time when nails were high-tech. There was a time when people had to be told how to use a telephone. Technology is just a tool. People use tools to improve their lives.": "Tom",
  "The police can't protect consumers. People need to be more aware and educated about identity theft. You need to be a little bit wiser, a little bit smarter and there's nothing wrong with being skeptical. We live in a time when if you make it easy for someone to steal from you, someone will.": "Frank",
  "I worry about kids today not having time to build a tree house or ride a bike or go fishing. I worry that life is getting faster and faster.": "John",
  "'Friday Night Lights' was kind of like my college years because I did four seasons of that. It was my first series. It was the most time I had with one character, and kind of growing and evolving with the character over that long of a span of time, it just allows you to sort of learn in a completely different way that I had never experienced.": "Jesse",
  "Silence is as deep as eternity, speech a shallow as time.": "Thomas",

  "Each person is an enigma. You're a puzzle not only to yourself but also to everyone else, and the great mystery of our time is how we penetrate this puzzle.": "Theodore",
  "You've got to know what you want. This is central to acting on your intentions. When you know what you want, you realize that all there is left then is time management. You'll manage your time to achieve your goals because you clearly know what you're trying to achieve in your life.": "Patch",

  "You know, people talk about this being an uncertain time. You know, all time is uncertain. I mean, it was uncertain back in - in 2007, we just didn't know it was uncertain. It was - uncertain on September 10th, 2001. It was uncertain on October 18th, 1987, you just didn't know it.": "Warren",

  "I have moments where I miss my old self. But I think anyone can get caught up in what we used to have. But at the same time, we can choose to focus on the beauty of now.": "Steve",
  "Freedom isn't free. It shouldn't be a bragging point that 'Oh, I don't get involved in politics,' as if that makes someone cleaner. No, that makes you derelict of duty in a republic. Liars and panderers in government would have a much harder time of it if so many people didn't insist on their right to remain ignorant and blindly agreeable.": "Bill",
  "Stop being a critic and be a light; don't be a judge, be a model. I think we are far too critical. I think the best way to correct behavior is to accentuate and affirm positive behavior and to ignore negative behavior. Generally speaking, there is a time to correct, of course; but my biggest advice would be, 'Affirm your child.'": "Sean",
  "I started singing about three years ago, I entered a local singing competition called Stratford Idol. The other people in the competition had been taking singing lessons and had vocal coaches.

  "Getting an audience is hard. Sustaining an audience is hard. It demands a consistency of thought, of purpose, and of action over a long period of time.": "Bruce",
  "Caste is a delicate issue. It's ubiquitous, and we are full of it. We should start to change things from individual level. But when you go to people and deny caste, they may not react favourably. I think if a decisive percentage of people, especially elites, start marrying out of their caste, we may see a casteless India in a generation's time.": "Pawan",

  "I think my mother is my biggest influence. There are so many things I hate about her but at the same time I'm thankful for her. All I know is that when I'm a parent I want to be just like my mom. I can talk to my mom more than any of my friends could talk to their parents.": "Nikki",
  "I just think Valentine's Day is a day to really appreciate the person you love, no matter who it is, and to spend time with them. I don't think it's all about fancy presents or whatever. I think it's about spending that quality time with that special person.": "Prince",

  "When the faith is strong enough, it is sufficient just to be. It's a journey towards simplicity, towards quietness, towards a kind of joy that is not in time. It's a journey that has taken us from primary identification with our body and our psyche, on to an identification with God, and ultimately beyond identification.": "Ram",
  "The mind of America is seized by a fatal dry rot - and it's only a question of time before all that the mind controls will run amuck in a frenzy of stupid, impotent fear.": "Hunter",

  "At a time like this, scorching irony, not convincing argument, is needed.": "Frederick",
  "The time is right for electric cars - in fact the time is critical.": "Carlos",
  "The only time I waste is time I spend doing something that, in my gut, I know I shouldn't. If I choose to spend time playing video games or sleeping in, then it's time well spent, because I chose to do it. I did it for a reason - to relax, to decompress or to feel good, and that was what I wanted to do.": "Simon",
  "Time is a sort of river of passing events, and strong is its current; no sooner is a thing brought to sight than it is swept by and another takes its place, and this too will be swept away.": "Marcus",
  "Time is the wisest counselor of all.": "Pericles",
  "In tough times, some of us see protecting the climate as a luxury, but that's an outdated 20th-century worldview from a time when we thought industrialization was the end goal, waste was growth, and wealth meant a thick haze of air pollution.": "Alex",
  "If you give a good thing to the world, then over time your karma will be good, and you'll receive good.": "Russell",
  "My life is full of drama, and I don't have time to worry about something as petty as what I look like.": "Adele",
  "A lot of people think international relations is like a game of chess. But it's not a game of chess, where people sit quietly, thinking out their strategy, taking their time between moves. It's more like a game of billiards, with a bunch of balls clustered together.": "Madeleine",
  "I try to do the right thing at the right time. They may just be little things, but usually they make the difference between winning and losing.": "Kareem",
  "I always had a philosophy which I got from my father. He used to say, 'Listen. God gave to you the gift to play football. This is your gift from God. If you take care of your health, if you are in good shape all the time, with your gift from God no one will stop you, but you must be prepared.'": "Pele",

  "I visualize a time when we will be to robots what dogs are to humans, and I'm rooting for the machines.": "Claude",
  "A lot of people are crazy, cruel and negative. They got a little too much time on their hands to discuss everybody else. I have a limited amount of energy to blow in a day. I'd rather read something that I like or watch a program I enjoy or ride my damn motorcycle or throw back a couple of shots of tequila with my friends.": "Queen",
  "I can be a goofball sometimes. I love having a good time and being carefree.": "Spencer",
  "All my time not devoted to my master's service was spent either in prayer, or in making experiments in casting different things in moulds made of earth, in attempting to make paper, gunpowder, and many other experiments, that, although I could not perfect, yet convinced me of its practicability if I had the means.": "Nat",
  "Friends are thieves of time.": "Francis",
  "Boxing is the ultimate challenge. There's nothing that can compare to testing yourself the way you do every time you step in the ring.": "Sugar",

  "I decided, very early on, just to accept life unconditionally; I never expected it to do anything special for me, yet I seemed to accomplish far more than I had ever hoped. Most of the time it just happened to me without my ever seeking it.": "Audrey",

  "It's very difficult to take candid portraits of children because they're moving around all the time.": "Ren",
  "My guiding principle and motivation was that I wanted to retire by the time I turned 35.

  "I feel that life is short, so we should be disciplined, but at the same time we should have a good time.": "Wyclef",
  "I can mention many moments that were unforgettable and revelatory. But the most single revelatory three minutes was the first time I put on scuba gear and dived on a coral reef. It's just the unbelievable fact that you can move in three dimensions.": "David",

  "I don't have time for their judgement and their stupidity and you know they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and look at their loser lives and then they look at me and they say, 'I can't process it' well, no, you never will stop trying, just sit back and enjoy the show.

  "Let the refining and improving of your own life keep you so busy that you have little time to criticize others.": "H.",
  "For me, forgiveness and compassion are always linked: how do we hold people accountable for wrongdoing and yet at the same time remain in touch with their humanity enough to believe in their capacity to be transformed?": "bell",
  "And now let me address all of you, high and low, rich and poor, one with another, to accept of mercy and grace while it is offered to you; Now is the accepted time, now is the day of salvation; and will you not accept it, now it is offered unto you?": "George",

  "Everything has seasons, and we have to be able to recognize when something's time has passed and be able to move into the next season. Everything that is alive requires pruning as well, which is a great metaphor for endings.": "Henry",
  "What's amazing is, if young people understood how doing well in school makes the rest of their life so much interesting, they would be more motivated. It's so far away in time that they can't appreciate what it means for their whole life.": "Bill",

  "We all come to the point where it's time to get yourself straight, as a businesswoman, a mother, whatever you are in life. It's tough love but it's also being real with yourself. It's important to take those rose-coloured glasses off and see what's going on.": "Kelly",
  "The nice girl thinks she's giving up something to get something better in return. She gives up control over her own life. When the time comes for her to get what she expected, she winds up disappointed. In addition to being empty-handed, she's depleted.": "Sherry",
  "Morocco has a lot to do in terms of democracy. The daily practice of democracy evolves in time. Trying to apply a Western democratic system to a country of the Maghreb, the Middle East, or the Gulf would be a mistake. We are not Germany, Sweden or Spain.": "Mohammed",

  "I have to think that I think it's always been a horse race between this administration's temporary political acumen and their completely, utterly, totally bankrupt policies.

  "Work is hard. Distractions are plentiful. And time is short.": "Adam",
  "October is a fine and dangerous season in America. a wonderful time to begin anything at all. You go to college, and every course in the catalogue looks wonderful.": "Thomas",
  "Everything must change and you do what you can with the changes that are made. You can't stop it. You can't fight it. Everybody tries to go back to yesterday, but you can't go back to yesterday. The only time there is, is now.": "Marla",
  "I spend several days at a time without enough sleep. At first, normal activities become annoying. When you are too tired to eat, you really need some sleep. A few days later, things become strange. Loud noises become louder and more startling, familiar sounds become unfamiliar, and life reinvents itself as a surrealist dream.": "Henry",
  "When I was 17, I worked in a mentoring program in Harlem designed to improve the community. That's when I first gained an appreciation of the Harlem Renaissance, a time when African-Americans rose to prominence in American culture. For the first time, they were taken seriously as artists, musicians, writers, athletes, and as political thinkers.": "Kareem",
  "Aaah, summer - that long anticipated stretch of lazy, lingering days, free of responsibility and rife with possibility. It's a time to hunt for insects, master handstands, practice swimming strokes, conquer trees, explore nooks and crannies, and make new friends.": "Darell",
  "No one remembers who climbed Mount Everest the second time.": "Edmund",
  "We have to acknowledge that adolescence is that time of transition where we begin to introduce to children that life isn't pretty, that there are difficult things, there are hard situations, it's not fair. Bad things happen to good people.": "Laurie",

  "Time will inevitably uncover dishonesty and lies history has no place for them.": "Norodom",
  "A guitar is a very personal extension of the person playing it. You have to be emotionally and spiritually connected to your instrument. I'm very brutal on my instruments, but not all the time.": "Eddie",
  "The winter solstice has always been special to me as a barren darkness that gives birth to a verdant future beyond imagination, a time of pain and withdrawal that produces something joyfully inconceivable, like a monarch butterfly masterfully extracting itself from the confines of its cocoon, bursting forth into unexpected glory.": "Gary",
  "Journalism is a craft that takes years to learn. It's like golf. You never get it right all the time. It's a game of fewer errors, better facts, and better reporting.": "Ben",
  "In Einstein's equation, time is a river. It speeds up, meanders, and slows down. The new wrinkle is that it can have whirlpools and fork into two rivers. So, if the river of time can be bent into a pretzel, create whirlpools and fork into two rivers, then time travel cannot be ruled out.": "Michio",
  "Time well spent results in more money to spend, more money to save, and more time to vacation.": "Zig",
  "It's so important to keep a marriage alive with small treats and doing little things for each other. Just remembering to say nice things and to have listening time is vital. That ghastly phrase 'quality time' means taking three minutes to sit down and be still with someone rather than yelling over your shoulder as you rush out.": "Joanna",

  "When you are insane, you are busy being insane - all the time.": "Sylvia",
  "There is too much disagreement for disagreement's sake. In a time of persistent challenges that still call into question our most sacred aspirations as a country, we cannot afford shallow callous divisiveness in our public debate.": "Cory",
  "Give your child quality time. If you're going to be with him for two hours, then disconnect from absolutely everything. Look at him in the eyes - get to know your baby. Sitting there as you watch TV is not quality time to me.": "Sandra",
  "The reason that fish form schools, birds form flocks, and bees form swarms is that they are smarter together than they would be apart. They don't take a vote; they don't take a poll: they form a system. They are all interactive and make a decision together in real time.": "Louis",
  "On the whole, human beings want to be good, but not too good, and not quite all the time.": "George",
  "The greatest part of a writer's time is spent in reading in order to write. A man will turn over half a library to make a book.": "Samuel",
  "For the first time in human evolution, the individual life is long enough, and the cultural transformation swift enough, that the individual mind is now a constituent player in the global transformation of human culture.": "William",
  "The economy of human time is the next advantage of machinery in manufactures.": "Charles",

  "Time passes, and little by little everything that we have spoken in falsehood becomes true.": "Marcel",
  "The characters I've played have been mostly violent, and I'm so far from being violent or aggressive. I spend a lot of time watching 'Fireman Sam' with my three-year-old son Louis.": "Tom",
  "The seed is a household object but at the same time it is a revolutionary symbol.": "Ai",
  "Jesus did not spend a great deal of time discoursing about the trinity or original sin or the incarnation, which have preoccupied later Christians. He went around doing good and being compassionate.": "Karen",
  "Standing at my door, I heard the discharge of a gun, and in four or five seconds of time, after the discharge, the small shot came rattling about me, one or two of which struck the house; which plainly demonstrates that the velocity of sound is greater than that of a cannon bullet.": "Benjamin",
  "The best things that capture your imagination are ones you hadn't thought of before and that aren't talked about in the news all the time.": "Steve",
  "The time making money should be greater than the time that you are spending money.": "Sophia",
  "There's something magical about spending a Sunday night watching real people at a deli, then watching fake people pretending to be real on TV, then engaging in (arguably) false interaction with (arguably) real people on the Internet. Never at any prior point in time has this been possible.": "Diablo",
  "If you don't have the time to read, you don't have the time or the tools to write.": "Stephen",
  "I'm a strong believer that you can build great companies in time of both greed and fear. But you have to be paying attention and operating under the right assumptions. You don't have to believe history repeats itself, but you should accept that history rhymes.": "Brad",

  "We have not the time to take our time.": "Eugene",

  "Time does not change us. It just unfolds us.": "Max",
  "Time is the substance from which I am made. Time is a river which carries me along, but I am the river; it is a tiger that devours me, but I am the tiger; it is a fire that consumes me, but I am the fire.": "Jorge",
  "Truth is the daughter of time, not of authority.": "Francis",
  "Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught.": "Oscar",
  "The great thing about the Wilburys was that none of us had to take the heat by ourselves. I was just a member of the band. Nobody felt like he was above anybody else. We had such a good time.": "Tom",
  "The first time I tried to write was when I was 14, after I got an electric guitar. I put a song together, and it wasn't that bad! The writing came natural to me.": "Tom",
  "It's hard to say how certain stories just punch us in the heart and the brain at the same time at the end. I suppose that's what we're all looking for. But each story has its own valence, its own way of saying goodbye to you.": "T.",
  "There are moments of life that we never forget, which brighten and brighten as time steals away.": "James",
  "His talent was as natural as the pattern that was made by the dust on a butterfly's wings. At one time he understood it no more than the butterfly did and he did not know when it was brushed or marred.": "Ernest",
  "I've spent a long time giving people the benefit of the doubt, and I'm tired of it.": "James",
  "Punctuality is the virtue of the bored.": "Evelyn",
  "And time for reflection with colleagues is for me a lifesaver it is not just a nice thing to do if you have the time. It is the only way you can survive.": "Margaret",
  "I have yet to meet anyone quite so stubborn as myself and animated by this overpowering passion that leaves me no time for thought or anything else. I have, in fact, no interest in life outside racing cars.": "Enzo",

  "The nose of a mob is its imagination. By this, at any time, it can be quietly led.": "Edgar",
  "There'd never been a more advantageous time to be a criminal in America than during the 13 years of Prohibition. At a stroke, the American government closed down the fifth largest industry in the United States - alcohol production - and just handed it to criminals - a pretty remarkable thing to do.": "Bill",
  "It is the hour to rend thy chains, the blossom time of souls.": "Katharine",
  "We all know we have a finite period of time. I just feel if I'm going to be alive, I want to be challenged - to be as immortal as possible. The path to that isn't an easy way, but it's a rewarding way.": "Frank",
  "We young Filipinos are trying to make over a nation and must not halt in our march, but from time to time turn our gaze upon our elders. We shall wish to read in their countenances approval of our actions.": "Jose",
  "When I sing, I feel like when you're first in love. It's more than sex. It's that point two people can get to they call love, when you really touch someone for the first time, but it's gigantic, multiplied by the whole audience. I feel chills.": "Janis",
  "Insecurity is a waste of time.": "Diane",
  "People come into your lives who you have a good time with, and time goes by and you still have a good time with them and you do stupid stuff with them. To me, that's life.": "Danny",

  "We look at life from the back side of the tapestry. And most of the time, what we see is loose threads, tangled knots and the like. But occasionally, God's light shines through the tapestry, and we get a glimpse of the larger design with God weaving together the darks and lights of existence.": "John",
  "I think getting married was a mistake along the way, but at the same time I wouldn't have the wonderful children I have if I didn't get married.": "Hugh",

  "Time is key to building your financial security.": "Suze",
  "When you face unexpected events, you have to try to overcome those problems, but at the same time, you have to continue working according to the plan that you defined since the beginning. So that's what we have tried to do - not to avoid the urgent responses but to continue the route that we had defined.": "Laura",
  "Don't let fear rule your life. Live one day at a time, and never be afraid.": "Tammy",

  "There are whole months at a time when my head is so full of ideas that I wake in the middle of the night and lie in the dark telling myself stories. There are also long, dark nights when I just know I'll never write another word: I'm finished, empty, a husk... Oh dear, yes, twitch, yawn, how I've suffered insomnia for my art.": "Debi",

  "If you spend any time with a man, you'll realize that we're all still little boys.": "Paul",
  "Nothing to me is unexpected. No disappointment is unexpected - whether it's movies or people or relationships. I'm always ready for the punch directly between the eyes. So I get hurt, but I never get hurt. Happens all the time.": "Brian",

  "A lot of things have been thrown at me in life, and I've got through it all without a rule book, taking it one day at a time.": "Yoko",

  "People of Berlin - people of the world - this is our moment. This is our time.": "Barack",

  "After we were hit on September 11, 2001, we were in a state of national shock. Less than six weeks later, on October 26 2001, the U.S.A. Patriot Act was passed by a Congress that had little chance to debate it; many said that they scarcely had time to read it.": "Naomi",

  "It would take six months to get to Mars if you go there slowly, with optimal energy cost. Then it would take eighteen months for the planets to realign. Then it would take six months to get back, though I can see getting the travel time down to three months pretty quickly if America has the will.": "Elon",
  "Most people have a harder time letting themselves love than finding someone to love them.": "Bill",
  "It's time to commit to finding the answer, to search for life beyond Earth. Mankind has a deep need to explore, to learn, to know. We also happen to be sociable creatures. It is important for us to know if we are alone in the dark.": "Stephen",

  "A woman is like a tea bag - you can't tell how strong she is until you put her in hot water.": "Eleanor",
  "Because you are women, people will force their thinking on you, their boundaries on you. They will tell you how to dress, how to behave, who you can meet and where you can go. Don't live in the shadows of people's judgement. Make your own choices in the light of your own wisdom.": "Amitabh",

  "The glory of justice and the majesty of law are created not just by the Constitution - nor by the courts - nor by the officers of the law - nor by the lawyers - but by the men and women who constitute our society - who are the protectors of the law as they are themselves protected by the law.": "Robert",
  "What I've never understood is why some women use plastic surgery to make themselves more attractive to men. The most beautiful woman is someone who's happy and is always smiling.": "Irina",

  "The principle goal of education in the schools should be creating men and women who are capable of doing new things, not simply repeating what other generations have done.": "Jean",
  "Being natural is incredibly empowering for women because it's just who you are. You're embracing all the beautiful things about you from your head to your toes. Because when you mask so much of your natural beauty, people don't get to see that.": "Rozonda",
  "We are braver and wiser because they existed, those strong women and strong men... We are who we are because they were who they were. It's wise to know where you come from, who called your name.": "Maya",
  "Men, their rights, and nothing more; women, their rights, and nothing less.": "Susan",
  "A miracle is really the only way to describe motherhood and giving birth. It's unbelievable how God has made us women and babies to endure and be able to do so much. A miracle, indeed. Such an incredible blessing.": "Jennie",
  "Let's be very clear: Strong men - men who are truly role models - don't need to put down women to make themselves feel powerful. People who are truly strong lift others up. People who are truly powerful bring others together.": "Michelle",

  "I think women are foolish to pretend they are equal to men they are far superior and always have been.": "William",

  "Ah, women. They make the highs higher and the lows more frequent.": "Friedrich",
  "I want to encourage women to embrace their own uniqueness. Because just like a rose is beautiful, so is a sunflower, so is a peony. I mean, all flowers are beautiful in their own way, and that's like women too.": "Miranda",
  "There's nothing more superficial to do than to paint a beautiful woman. The most beautiful portraits in art were of ugly women. If you paint Brigitte Bardot, it's a disaster. Sunsets, you have to stay away from sunsets. You paint a sunset, you are in great danger.": "Fernando",
  "Yes, we become stronger when men and women, young and old, gay and straight, native-born and immigrant fight together to create the kind of country we all know we can become.": "Bernie",
  "I think women should wear whatever makeup they want for themselves. Makeup should be fun.": "Emma",
  "You must make women count as much as men you must have an equal standard of morals and the only way to enforce that is through giving women political power so that you can get that equal moral standard registered in the laws of the country. It is the only way.": "Emmeline",
  "God of peace, bring your peace to our violent world: peace in the hearts of all men and women and peace among the nations of the Earth.": "Pope",
  "I think God made a woman to be strong and not to be trampled under the feet of men. I've always felt this way because my mother was a very strong woman, without a husband.": "Little",
  "Women should never go without earrings. Passing on them is an opportunity missed.": "Jennifer",
  "I don't know who invented high heels, but all women owe him a lot.": "Marilyn",

  "A women who doesn't wear perfume has no future.": "Coco",
  "There is a great stir about colored men getting their rights, but not a word about the colored women; and if colored men get their rights, and not colored women theirs, you see, the colored men will be masters over the women, and it will be just as bad as it was before.": "Sojourner",
  "Make women rational creatures, and free citizens, and they will quickly become good wives; - that is, if men do not neglect the duties of husbands and fathers.": "Mary",
  "The prolonged slavery of women is the darkest page in human history.": "Elizabeth",
  "On campuses, where Liberal softies still rule with an iron fist, feminism is as safe as a city with no women drivers. That is the only thing I support about Saudi Arabia, by the way.": "Milo",
  "Here's the thing, men have to also mature in how they see women, too. Because they need to understand that it's not just about how we look, it's about who we are. And I am going to tell you like this, 'If you can't love me with short hair, and you telling me I got to have long hair to be loved, guess what, I ain't the one for you.'": "Jada",
  "There will never be a new world order until women are a part of it.": "Alice",
  "If you look back in history of the women who are most memorable and most stylish, they were never the followers of fashion. They were the ones who were unique in their style, breakers of the rules. They were authentic, genuine, original. They were not following the trends.": "Nina",
  "Women ought to have representatives, instead of being arbitrarily governed without any direct share allowed them in the deliberations of government.": "Mary",
  "We are volcanoes. When we women offer our experience as our truth, as human truth, all the maps change. There are new mountains.": "Ursula",
  "Women in particular need to keep an eye on their physical and mental health, because if we're scurrying to and from appointments and errands, we don't have a lot of time to take care of ourselves. We need to do a better job of putting ourselves higher on our own 'to do' list.": "Michelle",
  "Men and women in my lifetime have died fighting for the right to vote: people like James Chaney, Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner, who were murdered while registering black voters in Mississippi in 1964, and Viola Liuzzo, who was murdered by the Ku Klux Klan in 1965 during the Selma march for voting rights.": "Jeff",
  "No doubt exists that all women are crazy it's only a question of degree.": "W.",
  "Women are like cars: we all want a Ferrari, sometimes want a pickup truck, and end up with a station wagon.": "Tim",
  "'Style Strategy' is about shopping smart, staying chic and making it all last. It's about showing women how to shop for value without compromising style.": "Nina",
  "Feminism is a socialist, anti-family, political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands, kill their children, practice witchcraft, destroy capitalism and become lesbians.": "Pat",
  "There's just something about vampires that's sexy. It's the same reason why women go for the bad boy - you want them but you shouldn't have them.": "Nina",
  "Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks, shall win my love.": "Washington",
  "Don't get caught up in the 'look' thing. Sometimes, we as men and women, the first thing that attracts us to someone is their physical appearance, and that's not always a good thing because what's good on the outside is not always good on the inside.": "Keith",
  "The faces of most American women over thirty are relief maps of petulant and bewildered unhappiness.": "F.",
  "I do not wish women to have power over men but over themselves.": "Mary",
  "It is downright mockery to talk to women of their enjoyment of the blessings of liberty while they are denied the use of the only means of securing them provided by this democratic-republican government: the ballot.": "Susan",
  "I truly believe that women should be financially independent from their men. And let's face it, money gives men the power to run the show. It gives men the power to define value. They define what's sexy. And men define what's feminine. It's ridiculous.": "Beyonce",
  "When God created man and woman, he was thinking, 'Who shall I give the power to, to give birth to the next human being?' And God chose woman. And this is the big evidence that women are powerful.": "Malala",
  "Women, we might as well be dogs baying the moon as petitioners without the right to vote!": "Susan",
  "Finally, let us understand that when we stand together, we will always win. When men and women stand together for justice, we win. When black, white and Hispanic people stand together for justice, we win.": "Bernie",
  "I've always been attracted to women who are assertive and have confidence - qualities older women possess. They've been on the Earth a little longer. They're more seasoned. They don't play games. They know what they want, and they're not afraid to tell you.": "Taye",
  "As it stands, motherhood is a sort of wilderness through which each woman hacks her way, part martyr, part pioneer; a turn of events from which some women derive feelings of heroism, while others experience a sense of exile from the world they knew.": "Rachel",
  "My mother made me truly appreciate women.": "Drake",
  "I'm a heroine addict. I need to have sex with women who have saved someone's life.": "Mitch",
  "Every company has two organizational structures: The formal one is written on the charts the other is the everyday relationship of the men and women in the organization.": "Harold",
  "Women who stay true to themselves are always more interesting and beautiful to me: women like Frida Kahlo, Georgia O'Keeffe and Anna Magnani - women who have style, chic, allure and elegance. They didn't submit to any standard of beauty - they defined it.": "Isabella",
  "I am not handsome, but when women hear me play, they come crawling to my feet.": "Niccolo",
  "If you don't love yourself, you can't love anybody else. And I think as women we really forget that.": "Jennifer",
  "We need to change attitudes. We can only change attitudes by working together. Government will do its bit, but I want you all to do your bit, too. So speak out, stand up against violence against women and girls, and that's the way we can eradicate it.": "Theresa",
  "It should be remarked that, as the principle of liberty is better understood, and more nobly interpreted, a broader protest is made in behalf of women. As men become aware that few have had a fair chance, they are inclined to say that no women have had a fair chance.": "Margaret",
  "I speak Spanish to God, Italian to women, French to men, and German to my horse.": "Charles",
  "Breast cancer alone kills some 458,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization, mainly in low- and middle-income countries. It has got to be a priority to ensure that more women can access gene testing and lifesaving preventive treatment, whatever their means and background, wherever they live.": "Angelina",
  "If it is right for men to fight for their freedom, and God knows what the human race would be like today if men had not, since time began, fought for their freedom, then it is right for women to fight for their freedom and the freedom of the children they bear.": "Emmeline",
  "This position is untenable, and there can be no pause in the agitation for full political power and responsibility until these are granted to all the women of the nation.": "Florence",
  "Girls have an unfair advantage over men: if they can't get what they want by being smart, they can get it by being dumb.": "Yul",
  "There's a fundamental difference between how often men remember to say 'I love you' and how often women want to hear 'I love you.' For the most part, it's on the guy. He's not withholding it intentionally. It's just that we kind of miss the point sometimes, that even in the most nonchalant way, telling the person how you feel is important.": "Brett",
  "Old-fashioned ways which no longer apply to changed conditions are a snare in which the feet of women have always become readily entangled.": "Jane",
  "I have made speeches urging women to adopt methods of rebellion such as have been adopted by men in every revolution.": "Emmeline",
  "I remember being in Japan when Destiny's Child put out 'Independent Women,' and women there were saying how proud they were to have their own jobs, their own independent thinking, their own goals. It made me feel so good, and I realized that one of my responsibilities was to inspire women in a deeper way.": "Beyonce",
  "I regard the rights of men and women equal. In Love's fair realm, husband and wife are king and queen, sceptered and crowned alike, and seated on the self-same throne.": "Robert",
  "Nothing can be more absurd than the practice that prevails in our country of men and women not following the same pursuits with all their strengths and with one mind, for thus, the state instead of being whole is reduced to half.": "Plato",
  "Women desire six things: They want their husbands to be brave, wise, rich, generous, obedient to wife, and lively in bed.": "Geoffrey",
  "I guess I was a bad boy... Yes, yes, I've had lots of women in my life.": "Kirk",
  "That little man in black there, he says women can't have as much rights as men 'cause Christ wasn't a woman! Where did your Christ come from? Where did your Christ come from? From God and a woman! Man had nothing to do with Him.": "Sojourner",
  "Sexual harassment on the job is not a problem for virtuous women.": "Phyllis",
  "Women need real moments of solitude and self-reflection to balance out how much of ourselves we give away.": "Barbara",
  "If women want any rights more than they's got, why don't they just take them, and not be talking about it.": "Sojourner",
  "Throughout human history, in any great endeavour requiring the common effort of many nations and men and women everywhere, we have learned - it is only through seriousness of purpose and persistence that we ultimately carry the day. We might liken it to riding a bicycle. You stay upright and move forward so long as you keep up the momentum.": "Ban",
  "Liberty lies in the hearts of men and women; when it dies there, no constitution, no law, no court can save it.": "Learned",
  "What's revolting is the body-positivity movement. What's revolting is this idea now that you can tell women they'll be happy and healthy at any size. Why? Because it tells women that you can be fat, and you can be unattractive, and you can be happy anyway. That's a lie.": "Milo",
  "I was a child who went about in a world of colors... My friends, my companions, became women slowly; I became old in instants.": "Frida",
  "We women of America tell you that America is not a democracy. Twenty million women are denied the right to vote.": "Alice",
  "Well, the tyranny of masculinity and the tyranny of patriarchy I think has been much more deadly to men than it has to women. It hasn't killed our hearts. It's killed men's hearts. It's silenced them; it's cut them off.": "Eve",
  "Women must learn to find self-worth within themselves, not through others. It is important to carve out a place just for you.": "Georgette",
  "When you're wounded and left on Afghanistan's plains, and the women come out to cut up what remains, jest roll to your rifle and blow out your brains and go to your gawd like a soldier.": "Rudyard",
  "There is no such thing as society: there are individual men and women, and there are families.": "Margaret",
  "By improving health, empowering women, population growth comes down.": "Bill",
  "Fashion is here to help make people look very important. If they have good taste and choose what suits them, I give them options on how they can do that. It's always sexy, and it's always with the same result: making women look fantastic.": "Vivienne",
  "Every day, I wake up determined to deliver a better life for the people all across this nation that have been neglected, ignored, and abandoned. I have visited the laid-off factory workers and the communities crushed by our horrible and unfair trade deals. These are the forgotten men and women of our country.": "Donald",
  "In the adjustment of the new order of things, we women demand an equal voice; we shall accept nothing less.": "Carrie",
  "You know, there's nothing damnable about being a strong woman. The world needs strong women. There are a lot of strong women you do not see who are guiding, helping, mothering strong men. They want to remain unseen. It's kind of nice to be able to play a strong woman who is seen.": "Ginger",
  "I gotta be honest with you. I'm kind of jealous of the way my dad gets to talk to my mom sometimes. Where are all those old-school women you can just take your day out on? When did they stop making those angels?": "Bill",
  "I do not make any apologies for my manner or personality. I come from a long line of very strong, black African-American women who neither bend nor bow. I haven't had very good modeling in submission.": "Faye",
  "Fear of serious injury alone cannot justify oppression of free speech and assembly. Men feared witches and burnt women. It is the function of speech to free men from the bondage of irrational fears.": "Louis",
  "For those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, we are grateful that such men and women were among us. For those who continue to serve, we honor their commitment. For those who return to civilian life, we honor their service.": "Steve",
  "I think beauty is not just about what we put on our heads or on our faces or what we wear: it's deeper than that, and if we can celebrate that, celebrate the women, not just the superficiality... I think it would be really gorgeous.": "Alek",
  "Childbirth is more admirable than conquest, more amazing than self-defense, and as courageous as either one.": "Gloria",
  "There are so many men and women who hold no distinctive positions but whose contribution towards the development of society has been enormous.": "Nelson",
  "I think that, if anything, the pageant is great for people who suffer from body issues. It's all about being comfortable with what you're given and what you have and being able to flaunt it without being insecure. It's about empowering women, not making them feel weak or less.": "Olivia",
  "For most women, the language of conversation is primarily a language of rapport: a way of establishing connections and negotiating relationships.": "Deborah",
  "I'm a multi-faceted woman and person, like all women are - there's no black and white. We have shades of grey in the middle. And even many more colours that other people don't see!": "Shakira",
  "I didn't want to let women down. One of the stereotypes I see breaking is the idea of aging and older women not being beautiful.": "Annie",
  "All places where women are excluded tend downward to barbarism; but the moment she is introduced, there come in with her courtesy, cleanliness, sobriety, and order.": "Harriet",
  "Women are never disarmed by compliments. Men always are. That is the difference between the sexes.": "Oscar",
  "I don't hate women - they just sometimes make me mad.": "Eminem",
  "Men are governed by lines of intellect - women: by curves of emotion.": "James",
  "Women are systematically degraded by receiving the trivial attentions which men think it manly to pay to the sex, when, in fact, men are insultingly supporting their own superiority.": "Mary",
  "Older women are best, because they always think they may be doing it for the last time.": "Ian",
  "Men are by nature merely indifferent to one another but women are by nature enemies.": "Arthur",
  "There was a time in my life when I thought I had everything - millions of dollars, mansions, cars, nice clothes, beautiful women, and every other materialistic thing you can imagine. Now I struggle for peace.": "Richard",
  "My little girls are the most beautiful women in the world. I am a lucky, lucky man. I will spend every day making sure that they know this.": "Russell",
  "Obviously, there is much similarity among the challenges of transgender people and all women - from health care to harassment to discrimination in the workplace.": "Gloria",
  "Women must tell men always that they are the strong ones. They are the big, the strong, the wonderful. In truth, women are the strong ones. It is just my opinion, I am not a professor.": "Coco",
  "I hate to generalize, but in general, both men and women suffer from ageism. Men much less because men gain power as they get older. Women lose power as they get older. Men are seen as gaining experience and being distinguished. Sons look forward to replacing their fathers.": "Gloria",
  "To honor our national promise to our veterans, we must continue to improve services for our men and women in uniform today and provide long overdue benefits for the veterans and military retirees who have already served.": "Solomon",
  "Write in such a way as that you can be readily understood by both the young and the old, by men as well as women, even by children.": "Ho",
  "The women who inspired this play deserved to be smacked across the head with a meat ax and that, I flatter myself, is exactly what I smacked them with.": "Clare",
  "It's always wonderful to get to know women, with the mystery and the joy and the depth. If you can make a woman laugh, you're seeing the most beautiful thing on God's Earth.": "Keanu",
  "A revival does two things. First, it returns the Church from her backsliding and second, it causes the conversion of men and women; and it always includes the conviction of sin on the part of the Church. What a spell the devil seems to cast over the Church today!": "Billy",
  "The labor of women in the house, certainly, enables men to produce more wealth than they otherwise could; and in this way women are economic factors in society. But so are horses.": "Charlotte",
  "Whatever women do, they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult.": "Charlotte",
  "Women love always: when earth slips from them, they take refuge in heaven.": "George",
  "Being a woman is a terribly difficult task, since it consists principally in dealing with men.": "Joseph",
  "I never realized until lately that women were supposed to be the inferior sex.": "Katharine",
  "Plain women know more about men than beautiful women do.": "Katharine",
  "Being the boss anywhere is lonely. Being a female boss in a world of mostly men is especially so.": "Robert",
  "I am my own woman.": "Evita",
  "I think that the path that I took was normal in the American society where young women and men are not trained as to how to make the transition from being a girl to being a woman, from being a boy to being a man. And so I think that most young people in America live by trial and error, and not by parental instruction, community guidance.": "Sister",
  "Suffrage is a common right of citizenship. Women have the right of suffrage. Logically it cannot be escaped.": "Victoria"
