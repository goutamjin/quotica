  "The marine corps teaches you how to be miserable. This is invaluable for an artist. Marines love to be miserable. Marines derive a perverse satisfaction in having colder chow, crappier equipment, and higher casualty rates than any outfit of dogfaces, swabjockies, or flyboys, all of whom they despise. Why? Because those candyasses don't know how to be miserable. The artist committing himself to his calling has to be miserable. The artist committing himself to his calling has volunteered for hell, whether he knows it or not, he will be dining for the duration on a diet of isolation, rejection, self-doubt, despair, ridicule, contempt, and humiliation. The artist must be like that marine: he has to know how to be miserable. He has to love being miserable. He has to take pride in being more miserable than any soldier, or swabbie, or desk jockey, because this is war, baby, and war is hell.": "Steven",

  "One of the most difficult defilements of the spirit to deal with is the critical spirit. A critical spirit has its root in pride. Because of the 'plank' of pride in our own eye we are not capable of dealing with the 'speck' of need in someone else. We are often like the Pharisee who, completely unconscious of his own need prayed \"God, I thank you that I am not like other men\" (Luke 18:11). We are quick to see - and to speak of - the faults of others, but slow to see our own needs. How sweetly we relish the opportunity to speak critically of someone else - even when we are unsure of the facts. We forge that \"a man who stirs up dissension among brothers\" by criticizing one to another is one of the \"six thing which the Lord hates\" (Proverbs 6:16-19)": "Jerry",

I\u2019m wrong out of the forge, the kitchen, or off th\u2019 meshes. You won\u2019t find half so much fault in me if you think me in forge dress, with my hammer in my hand, or even my pipe. You won\u2019t find half so much fault in me if, supposing as you should ever wish to see me, you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith, there, at the old anvil, in the old burnt apron, sticking to the old work.

  "Literature is as old as speech. It grew out of human need for it and it has not changed except to become more needed. The skalds, the bards, the writers are not separate and exclusive. From the beginning, their functions, their duties, and their responsibilities have been decreed by our species... the writer is delegated to declare and to celebrate man's proven capacity for greatness of heart and spirit - for gallantry in defeat, for courage, compassion and love. In the endless war against weakness and despair, these are the bright rally flags of hope and of emulation. I hold that a writer who does not passionately believe in the perfectibility of man has no dedication nor any membership in literature.": "John",

  "And the view was suddenly clear to me. The world opened out to its grim beyonds and I realized that, at forty, one must learn the rigors of acceptance. Capitalize it: Acceptance.

  "We have laws about human rights in place for a reason and even if those laws are so often not enforced BY the law, these laws teach us our rights as human beings. I was shocked when I first discovered them, but at the same time I found them empowering; especially the ones about emotional abuse and neglect. Always remember that we are healing from the damage and that before the damage can be overcome, it has to be acknowledged.Acceptance in the context of accepting what happened is not the same thing as acceptance of the person who did it. Accepting the way a person \u201cis\u201d does not apply when abuse or mistreatment is involved.

  "The second hugely seductive move is to signal that we view the other person with a mixture of tenderness and realism. It\u2019s often imagined that it\u2019ll be seductive to convey an air of adoration, to hint that the other strikes us as exceptionally attractive or accomplished. But surprisingly, it is deeply worrying to be obviously adored, because everyone, from the inside, knows very well that they don\u2019t deserve intense acclaim, are often disappointing and sometimes quite simply pitiful.So seduction involves suggesting both that one likes the other person a lot \u2013 and yet can see their frailty quite clearly, that one cope with it and forgive it with gentle indulgence. One might, towards the end of the evening drop in a small warm tease that alludes to our understanding of some less than perfect side of them: \u2018I suppose you stayed under the duvet feeling a bit sorry for yourself after that?\u2019 we might ask, with a benign smile.Such a gesture implies that we like another person not under a mistaken notion that they are flawless but with a full and unfrightened appreciation of their frailties. That ends up being powerfully seductive because it is, first and foremost, reassuring. It suggests the ideal way that we would like someone to view us within the testing conditions of a real relationship. We crave not admiration, but to be properly known and yet still liked and forgiven.": "Alain",

  "Rather than trying to control what can never be controlled, we can find a sense of security in being able to meet what is actually happening. This is allowing for the mystery of things: not judging but rather cultivating a balance of mind that can receive what is happening, whatever it is. This acceptance is the source of our safety and confidence.When we feel unhappiness or pain, it is not a sign that things have gone terribly wrong or that we have done something wrong by not being able to control the circumstances. Pain and pleasure are constantly coming and going, and yet we can be happy. When we allow for the mystery , sometimes we can discover that right in the heart of a very difficult time, right in the midst of a painful situation, there is freedom. In those moments when we realize how much we cannot control, we can learn to let go. As we begin to understand this, we move from a mode of struggling to control what comes into our lives into a mode of simply wishing to truly connect with what is.

Abraham chose to 'accept' God's will, knowing full well that God loved him and not only wanted the best for him, but knew exactly what that 'best' would be.

If it were something I'd experienced before, then I'd be able to understand it more clearly, but this is the first time, so I can't. For now all I can do is put off making any detailed judgments and accept things as they are. Just like I accept the sky, the clouds, and the river.

  "This need to be right has put a huge burden on me, one that I never deserved to have to carry. Part of it, I know, is cultural--in this age of information at a moment's notice, we've come to expect people to have answers--the right answers--at the drop of a hat. I feel very fortunate that over the last decade or so I've been able to leave the need to be right behind me and move on with my life with a more healthy perspective. I'm now willing not just to admit that I'm wrong, but also to stick my neck out with ideas or thoughts that may be wrong. The possibility of being wrong no longer threatens my emotional well-being; if I'm wrong, I'm wrong, and I learn from that.": "Tom",

The love that would bring on my surrender. The love that would inspire me to give everything. As I lay there, it occurred to me that while I had been dreaming of this big love, this ultimate love, I had, without realizing it, been giving and receiving love for most of my life. As with the trees that were right in front of me, I had been unable to value what sustained me, fed me, and gave me pleasure.

  "A love of neighbor manifests itself in the tolerance not only of opinions of others but, what is more important, of the essence and uniqueness of others, when we subscribe to that religious philosophy of life that insists that God has made each man and woman an individual sacred personality endowed with a specific temperament, created with differing needs, hungers, dreams. This is a variegated, pluralistic world where no two stars are the same and every snowflake has its own distinctive pattern. God apparently did not want a regimented world of sameness. That is why creation is so manifold. So it is with us human beings. Some are born dynamic and restless; others placid and contemplative\u2026One man\u2019s temperament is full throated with laughter; another\u2019s tinkles with the sad chimes of gentle melancholy. Our physiques are different, and that simple difference oftentimes drives us into conflicting fulfillment of our natures, to action or to thought, to passion or to denial, to conquest or to submission.

But since no one\u2019s putting a gun to their head to ask them, they must compel. They\u2019re probably necessary on a symbolic level more than a literal one, as people cobble together an imagination of what a life devoted to \u201cmaking\u201d might be like.[I think people want a path to follow.

I used to dance in New York. My Lower East Side days. Modern dance, or whatever. One thing I learned as a dancer was that people learn combinations different ways. Some people, if they get the right side, they can also get the left side right off the top of their head. Some people need to be taught both right and left. Some people count, some people never count, you know? I noticed then that, for me, it was really watching the whole person dancing, trying to take in the whole combination at once, that helped me learn it. I think I\u2019m the same way as a reader\u2014I like to take in the whole book, not getting too specific about how they did it, but ride the bigger example.I mean, at the end of the day, the answer to the question \u201cHow did you do it?\u201d is right there, on the page. They\u2019re showing you how they did it, by doing it. Maybe it\u2019s different with art, when you don\u2019t know if someone had all their sculptures knitted or welded by elves somewhere, but with writing, the answer to the question \u201cHow do you write a book like this?\u201d is usually, \u201cLike this\u201d [points to book].": "Maggie",

  "I began to realize how simple life could be if one had a regular routine to follow with fixed hours and a fixed salary and very little original thinking to do. The life of a writer is absolute hell compared with the life of a businessman. The writer has to force himself to work. He has to make his own hours and if he doesn\u2019t go to his desk at all there is nobody to scold him. If he is a writer of fiction he lives in a world of fear. Each new day demands new ideas and he can never be sure whether he is going to come up with them or not. Two hours of writing fiction leaves this particular writer absolutely drained. For those two hours he has been miles away, he has been somewhere else, in a different place with totally different people, and the effort of swimming back into normal surroundings is very great. It is almost a shock. The writer walks out of his workroom in a daze. He wants a drink. He needs it. It happens to be a fact that nearly every writer of fiction in the world drinks more whisky than is good for him. He does it to give himself faith, hope and courage. A person is a fool to become a writer. His only compensation is absolute freedom. He has no master except his own soul, and that, I am sure, is why he does it.": "Roald",

When he arrived at the last and said young Timothy was writing a novel and wanted to become a writer, the good lady, unaware that I was entering the room, told my father not to worry, I would soon change my mind and find something sensible to do.

  "A lady sent me an email recently advising me to change my environment. I guess she read through the lines of my writing and I had adequately painted a portrait of my experiences for her to form a conclusion that melancholia and fatalistic views of my protagonist reveals the depth or layers of my own consciousness. I haven't experienced much of life at twenty five but I've noticed enough, more than most people do at my age. I won't lie that sometimes it leaves me menacingly depressed. I only represent myself. I am in no competition with anyone. I often muse that if people were half concerned about wars and crimes, corruption in high places and poverty with the heavy regard they place upon other's lives then we would have a better world. Just imagine if the average man on the road heckled politicians the way they are often inclined to insult a fat woman. I have a Ton load of bad experiences but I have not allowed them to deter me, people will think about them at some high point in my life and try to use it to besmirch whatever glory I may attain. I understand that too, they can use it for whatever barometer on their lives they see fit but as for me, I used my crash falls as stairwells to greatness.

In those days, also, it was unheard of, by us certainly, that to get any help, even from members of our own family, let alone from the government, which would have been disgraceful. Thank God that that kind of folly in thinking is obsolete. There is a temptation to feel, \u2018Well, we all made it; why can\u2019t these other poor people make it?\u2019 And, of course, nothing is more than stupid than that attitude. I must confess that I find that attitude among many countrymen of my own who do find themselves taking undue pride in their own sense of ability \u2014 of being equal to any situation, and of seeing it through and improving it, and so on. And then, putting that against other people who don\u2019t have that, and thereby implying that the other people are lazy. Not taking into account the whole different structure and identity and a people who have survived for centuries under very harsh conditions and members of a very great culture, and I am talking about the Indians, to begin with, in the Valley \u2014 the San Joaquin Valley, in Fresno, in Tulare, and the mountains, and there are many tribes of them, of different kinds, and I am talking about, also, the Mestizos, the mixtures of Mexican, Spaniards with Indians, making the Mexican. And I am talking about any minority which is considered by anybody as being innately of itself indolent. This kind of narrow thinking is a temptation to all sorts of people, and one has to be sympathetic with the people who are wrong, too, you see. It is not enough just to be sympathetic with the people who are belittled; it is necessary to be sympathetic with the people who belittle them.

The harsh, imperious call reaches the spirit on that remote path that leads into the shadows, the coolness and peace. He hears the call of life, the clear, fresh, mocking summons to return to that distant scene which he had already left so far behind him, and already forgotten. And there may well up in him something like a feeling of same for a neglected duty; a sense of renewed energy, courage, and hope; he may recognize a bond existing still between him and that stirring, colourful, callous existence which he thought he had left so far behind him. Then, how far he may have wandered on his distant path, he will turn back--and live. But if he shudders when he hears life's voice, if the memory of that vanished scene and the sound of that lusty summons make him shake his head, make him put out his hand to ward off as he flies forward in the way of escape that has opened to him--then it is clear that the patient will die.\" Buddenbrooks": "Thomas",

Everything that the idle crowd usually does to kill time, it now did for the benefit of the Slavs: balls, concerts, dinners, speeches, ladies' dresses, beer, restaurants\u2014all bore witness to our sympathy with the Slavs.With much that was spoken and written on the subject Konyshev did not agree in detail. He saw that the Slav question had become one of those fashionable diversions which, ever succeeding one another, serve to occupy Society; he saw that too many people took up the question from interested motives. He admitted that the papers published much that was unnecessary and exaggerated with the sole aim of drawing attention to themselves, each outcrying the other. He saw that amid this general elation in Society those who were unsuccessful or discontented leapt to the front and shouted louder than anyone else: Commanders-in-Chief without armies, Ministers without portfolios, journalists without papers, and party leaders without followers. He saw that there was much that was frivolous and ridiculous; but he also saw and admitted the unquestionable and ever-growing enthusiasm which was uniting all classes of society, and with which one could not help sympathizing. The massacre of our coreligionists and brother Slavs evoked sympathy for the sufferers and indignation against their oppressors. And the heroism of the Serbs and Montenegrins, fighting for a great cause, aroused in the whole nation a desire to help their brothers not only with words but by deeds.Also there was an accompanying fact that pleased Koznyshev. It was the manifestation of public opinion. The nation had definitely expressed its wishes. As Koznyshev put it, ' the soul of the nation had become articulate.'

  "Horse Frightened by a Lion depicts a majestic stallion in a very different situation. Stubbs painted this magnetic masterpiece to illustrate the nature of the sublime, which was one of his era's most popular philosophical concepts,and its relation to a timelessly riveting feeling: fear. The magnificent horse galloping through a vast wilderness encounters the bottom-up stimulus of a crouching predator and responds with a dramatic display of what psychologists mildly call \"negative emotion.\" The equine superstar's arched neck, dilated eyes, and flared nostrils are in fact the very picture of overwhelming dread. The painting's subject matter reflects he philosopher Edmund Burke's widely circulated Philosophical Enquiry into the Origins of Our Ideas of the Sublime and Beautiful, which asserts that because \"terror\" is unparalleled in commanding \"astonishment,\" or total, single-pointed,--indeed, rapt--attention, it is \"the ruling principle of the sublime.": "Winifred",
  "Recently, the search for what he calls \"the splinters that make up different attention problems\" has taken Castellanos in a new direction. First, he explains that your brain is far less concerned with your brilliant ideas or searing emotions than with its own internal \"gyroscopic busyness,\" which consumes 65 percent of its total energy. Every fifty seconds, its activity fluctuates, causing what he calls a \"brownout.\" No one knows the purpose of these neurological events, but Castellanos has a thesis: the clockwork pulses enable the brain's circuits to stay \"logged on\" and available to communicate with one another, even when they're not being used. \"Imagine you're a cabdriver on your day off,\" Castellanos says. \"You don't need to use your workday circuits on a Sunday, but to keep those channels open, your brain sends a ping through them every minute or so. The fluctuations are the brain's investment in maintaining its circuits online.": "Winifred",

  "To Judaism Christians ascribe the glory of having been the first religion to teach a pure monotheism. But monotheism existed long before the Jews attained to it. Zoroaster and his earliest followers were monotheists, dualism being a later development of the Persian theology. The adoption of monotheism by the Jews, which occurred only at a very late period in their history, was not, however, the result of a divine revelation, or even of an intellectual superiority, for the Jews were immeasurably inferior intellectually to the Greeks and Romans, to the Hindus and Egyptians, and to the Assyrians and Babylonians, who are supposed to have retained a belief in polytheism. This monotheism of the Jews has chiefly the result of a religious intolerance never before equaled and never since surpassed, except in the history of Christianity and Mohammedanism, the daughters of Judaism. Jehovistic priests and kings tolerated no rivals of their god and made death the penalty for disloyalty to him.

The idea that people's historical experience is inessential to them, that it can be shed at will, makes it possible to argue more strongly for the Enlightenment's claim to universality: Muslims, as members of the abstract category \"humans,\" can be assimilated or (as some recent theorist have put it) \"translated\" into a global (\"European\") civilization once they have divested themselves of what many of them regard (mistakenly) as essential to themselves. The belief that human beings can be separated from their histories and traditions makes it possible to urge a Europeanization of the Islamic world.

  "Before continuing further, it is important to gain an understanding of how democracy is perceived by the ordinary people of the Middle East. Democracy, as a secular entity, is unlikely t be favorably received by the vast majority of Middle Easterners who are devout followers of the Islamic faith. Traditionally, there is tension among the Muslim countries with respect to the establishment of a democratic form of government. On the one hand, there are those who believe that democratic rule can co-exist with the religious nature of the Middle Easter societies; however, on the other hand there are those who believe that the tribal structure of the Middle Eastern countries may not be suitable for democratic rule as too many factions will emerge. The result will be a \"fractured\" society that cannot effectively unite and there is also the risk that this could impact the cohesion produced by the Muslim faith. Although concerns exist, for the most part, the spirit of democracy, or self rule, is viewed as a positive endeavor so long as it builds up the country and sustains the religious base versus devaluing religion and creating instability. Creating this balance will be the challenge as most Western democracies have attempted to maintain a separation of church and state. What this suggests is that as democracy grows in the Middle East, it is not necessarily going to evolve upon a Western template\u2014it will have its own shape or form coupled with stronger religious ties.": "Abdel",
  "Given the religious nature of the Middle Eastern culture, how might a Middle Eastern democracy [be] structured? Will there be three or four branches of government? Should a religious branch be added to the executive, legislative and judicial branches to ensure that Islamic beliefs and law are followed? A simple answer might be yes, but that is probably not the best means. Ideally, the legislative, executive and judicial bodies should all take Islamic beliefs into consideration when carrying out their duties. As such, there should be no need for a separate religious branch. However, to codify the major tenets of the Islamic faith, they should be represented in the constitution or similar document. This does not mean a theocracy will be established, rather it means that a democracy will be established built upon Islamic beliefs.": "Abdel",

  "Quotes By Transcendologist Kurt Kawohl 1941 - If the medieval practices and the medieval beliefs of Christianity, Judaism and Islam that are based on superstitions were eliminated, then we could start building a rational and logical belief system that is based on truth and an understanding of spirituality. This is the value of truthfulness and rationality.The goals of ALL religions are the same; a deserved, appropriate, just finale. God is the rational Purity that does not require servitude, ritualistic prayers or a forced slavery in order for the soul to be a part of that Purity for eternity. God is spiritual, the progressive and accumulative spiritual intelligence of all the righteous souls who have passed into the spiritual realm. God does not and never has meddled in the tangible universe. It is of no importance during our physical life whether God exists or not if one so chooses. Whether or not one believes in a spirit or God really makes no difference to God. Righteous living will determine the continuance and destiny of our spirit/soul. Abraham, Moses, Noah, Jesus, Muhammad, Buddha, Krishna, Bah\u00c3\u00a1'u'll\u00c3\u00a1h, Zoroaster, Ahmad, Nanak and many others of various faiths are believed to have achieved spiritual enlightenment by mastering the art of spiritual transcendence.  Everything in the universe follows the universal laws which separate the physical and the spiritual existence. Energy is power, vigor, liveliness, intensity. It is a measurable quantity, without reference to its nature or source. Energy, or life is a fundamental attribute and function of the universe. Our bodies build up and harness a minute amount of spiritual energy that is transferred into the spiritual dimension upon our death. Then this spiritual energy is limitless because it lacks resistance and this energy can assimilate as a unity or be separate and individual. It is this spiritual energy that is God. It is a composition of the spiritual intellect of the universe, of every soul that has passed from the physical universe into the spiritual universe. It can create a spiritual existence of beauty that is beyond the imagination\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6my spirit has experienced it.": "Kurt",

  "On August 10, 1984, my plane landed in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan. There were no skyscrapers here. The blue domes of the mosques and the faded mountains were the only things rising above the adobe duvals (the houses). The mosques came alive in the evening with multivoiced wailing: the mullahs were calling the faithful to evening prayer. It was such an unusual spectacle that, in the beginning, I used to leave the barracks to listen \u2013 the same way that, in Russia, on spring nights, people go outside to listen to the nightingales sing. For me, a nineteen-year-old boy who had lived his whole life in Leningrad, everything about Kabul was exotic: enormous skies \u2013 uncommonly starry \u2013 occasionally punctured by the blazing lines of tracers. And spread out before you, the mysterious Asian capital where strange people were bustling about like ants on an anthill: bearded men, faces darkend by the sun, in solid-colored wide cotton trousers and long shirts. Their modern jackets, worn over those outfits, looked completely unnatural. And women, hidden under plain dull garments that covered them from head to toe: only their hands visible, holding bulging shopping bags, and their feet, in worn-out shoes or sneakers, sticking out from under the hems.And somewhere between this odd city and the deep black southern sky, the wailing, beautifully incomprehensible songs of the mullahs. The sounds didn't contradict each other, but rather, in a polyphonic echo, melted away among the narrow streets.

  "In the Muslim world, much of the violence that takes place is due to clashes between Shiites and the other major sect, the Sunni. The differences go back to a dispute over who was in charge of the Muslim faith after Muhammad died 632 years after Jesus, God\u2019s son, walked the earth. I\u2019m oversimplifying, but the Sunnis thought the new leader should be elected, and Shiites thought the leadership should stay within the family of Muhammad. The Sunnis, a larger faction, won the day, and the Prophet Muhammad\u2019s close friend and adviser, Abu Bakr, became the first HMIC, the Head-Muslim-in-Charge. Officially, they called him their caliph and he ruled as sort of a head of state over the caliphate, the name for a Muslim state run by one religious leader. Since then the Shiites have fought the Sunnis for control because they don\u2019t recognize the authority of the elected Muslim leaders\u2014who for the most part have been Sunnis.

I wanted to be like Popper: free of constraint, recognizing greatness but unafraid to detect its flaws.Spinoza was clear-minded and fearless. He was the first modern European to state clearly that the world is not ordained by a separate God. Nature created itself, Spinoza said. Reason, not obedience, should guide our lives. Though it took centuries to crumble, the entire ossified cage of European social hierarchy\u2014from kings to serfs, and between men and women, all of it shored up by the Catholic Church\u2014was destroyed by this thought.

I can sympathize with that. But that does not mean that we should be blind to the potential consequences of accommodating beliefs that are openly hostile to Western laws, traditions, and values.

  "Throughout the Middle Ages, Jews had no part in the culture of Christian countries, and were too severely persecuted to be able to make contributions to civilization, beyond supplying capital for the building of cathedrals and such enterprises. It was only among the Mohammedans, at that period, that Jews were treated humanely, and were able to pursue philosophy and enlightened speculation. Throughout the Middle Ages, the Mohammedans were more civilized and more humane than the Christians. Christians persecuted Jews, especially at times of religious excitement; the Crusades were associated with appalling pogroms. In Mohammedan countries, on the contrary, Jews at most times were not in any way ill treated. Especially in Moorish Spain, they contributed to learning; Maimonides (1135\u20131204), who was born at Cordova, is regarded by some as the source of much of Spinoza\u2019sphilosophy.Mohammedan civilization in its great days was admirable in the arts and in many technical ways, but it showed no capacity for independent speculation in theoretical matters.

  "Any critique of Islam is denounced as an expression of Western Islamophobia, Salman Rushdie is denounced for unnecessarily provoking Muslims and being (partially, at least) responsible for the fatwa condemning him to death, and so on. The result of such stances is what one should expect in such cases: the more the Western liberal Leftists probe into their guilt, the more they are accused by Muslim fundamentalists of being hypocrites who try to conceal their hatred of Islam. [T]his constellation perfectly reproduces the paradox of the superego: the more you obey what the Other demands of you, the guiltier you are. It is as if the more you tolerate Islam, the stronger its pressure on you will be. What this implies is that terrorist fundamentalists, be they Christian or Muslim, are not really fundamentalists in the authentic sense of the term--what they lack is a feature that is easy to discern in all authentic fundamentalists, from Tibetan Buddhists to the Amish in the US: the absence of resentment and envy, the deep indifference towards the non-believers' way of life. If today's so-called fundamentalists really believe they have found their way to Truth, why should they feel threatened by non-believers, why should they envy them? When a Buddhist encounters a Western hedonist, he hardly condemns. He just benevolently notes that the hedonist's search for happiness is self-defeating. In contrast to true fundamentalists, the terrorist pseudo-fundamentalists are deeply bothered, intrigued and fascinated by the sinful life of the non-believers. One can feel that, in fighting the sinful other, they are fighting their own temptation. The passionate intensity of a fundamentalist mob bears witness to the lack of true conviction; deep in themselves, terrorist fundamentalists also lack true conviction--their violent outbursts are proof of it. How fragile the belief of a Muslim would be if he felt threatened by, say, a stupid caricature in a low-circulation Danish newspaper? Fundamentalist Islamic terror is not grounded in the terrorists' conviction of their superiority and in their desire to safeguard their cultural-religious identify from the onslaught of global consumerist civilization. The problem with fundamentalists is not that we consider them inferior to us, but, rather, that they themselves secretly consider themselves inferior. This is why our condescending politically correct assurances that we feel no superiority towards them only makes them more furious and feed their resentment. The problem is not cultural difference (their effort to preserve their identity), but the opposite: the fact that the fundamentalists are already like us, that, secretly, they have already internalized our standards and measure themselves by them.": "Slavoj",

In the past, Westerners who accused Muslims of blindly following ancient scriptures came to deserved grief from academics\u2014notably the late Edward Said\u2014who pointed out that calling Muslims 'ancient' was usually just another way to denigrate them. Look instead, these scholars urged, to the conditions in which these ideologies arose\u2014the bad governance, the shifting social mores, the humiliation of living in lands valued only for their oil.\"Without acknowledgment of these factors, no explanation of the rise of the Islamic State could be complete.

  "Here is something I have learned the hard way, but which a lot of well-meaning people in the West have a hard time accepting: All human beings are equal, but all cultures and religions are not. A culture that celebrates femininity and considers women to be the masters of their own lives is better than a culture that mutilates girls\u2019 genitals and confines them behind walls and veils or flogs or stones them for falling in love. A culture that protects women\u2019s rights by law is better than a culture in which a man can lawfully have four wives at once and women are denied alimony and half their inheritance. A culture that appoints women to its supreme court is better than a culture that declares that the testimony of a woman is worth half that of a man. It is part of Muslim culture to oppress women and part of all tribal cultures to institutionalize patronage, nepotism, and corruption. The culture of the Western Enlightenment is better. In the real world, equal respect for all cultures doesn\u2019t translate into a rich mosaic of colorful and proud peoples interacting peacefully while maintaining a delightful diversity of food and craftwork. It translates into closed pockets of oppression, ignorance, and abuse. Many people genuinely feel pain at the thought of the death of whole cultures. I see this all the time.

  "The violent injunctions of the Quran and the violent precedents set by Muhammad set the tone for the Islamic view of politics and of world history. Islamic scholarship divides the world into two spheres of influence, the House of Islam (dar al-Islam) and the House of War (dar al-harb). Islam means submission, and so the House of Islam includes those nations that have submitted to Islamic rule, which is to say those nations ruled by Sharia law. The rest of the world, which has not accepted Sharia law and so is not in a state of submission, exists in a state of rebellion or war with the will of Allah. It is incumbent on dar al-Islam to make war upon dar al-harb until such time that all nations submit to the will of Allah and accept Sharia law. Islam's message to the non-Muslim world is the same now as it was in the time of Muhammad and throughout history: submit or be conquered. The only times since Muhammad when dar al-Islam was not actively at war with dar alharb were when the Muslim world was too weak or divided to make war effectively. But the lulls in the ongoing war that the House of Islam has declared against the House of War do not indicate a forsaking of jihad as a principle but reflect a change in strategic factors. It is acceptable for Muslim nations to declare hudna, or truce, at times when the infidel nations are too powerful for open warfare to make sense. Jihad is not a collective suicide pact even while \"killing and being killed\" (Sura 9:111) is encouraged on an individual level.

  "In times of strife, taliban have usually mobilized in defense of tradition. British documents from as early as 1901 decry taliban opposition to colonialism in present-day Pakistan. However, as with so much else, it was the Soviet invasion and the US response that sent the transformative shock. In the 1980s, as guns and money coursed through the ranks of the Kandahar mujahedeen, squabbling over resources grew so frequent that many increasingly turned to religious law to settle their disputes. Small, informal bands of taliban, who were also battling against the Russians, established religious courts that heard cases from feuding fighters from across the south. Seemingly impervious to the lure of foreign riches, the taliban courts were in many eyes the last refuge of tradition in a world in upheaval....Thousands of talibs rallied to the cause, and an informal, centuries-old phenomenon of the Pashtun countryside morphed into a formal political and military movement, the Taliban. As a group of judges and legal-minded students, the Taliban applied themselves to the problem of anarchy with an unforgiving platform of law and order. The mujahedeen had lost their way, abandoned their religious principles, and dragged society into a lawless pit. So unlike most revolutionary movements, Islamic or otherwise, the Taliban did not seek to overthrow an existing state and substitute it with one to their liking. Rather, they sought to build a new state where none existed. This called for \u201celiminating the arbitrary rule of the gun and replacing it with the rule of law\u2014and for countryside judges who had arisen as an alternative to a broken tribal system, this could only mean religious law.Jurisprudence is thus part of the Taliban\u2019s DNA, but its single-minded pursuit was carried out to the exclusion of all other aspects of basic governance. It was an approach that flirted dangerously with the wrong kind of innovation: in the countryside, the choice was traditionally yours whether to seek justice in religious or in tribal courts, yet now the Taliban mandated religious law as the compulsory law of the land. It is true that, given the nature of the civil war, any law was better than none at all\u2014but as soon as things settled down, fresh problems arose. The Taliban\u2019s jurisprudence was syncretic, mixing elements from disparate schools of Islam along with heavy doses of traditional countryside Pashtun practice that had little to do with religion. As a result, once the Taliban marched beyond the rural Pashtun belt and into cities like Kabul or the ethnic minority regions of northern Afghanistan, they encountered a resentment that rapidly bred opposition.": "Anand",

The Sufis compare our spiritual heart, the seat of God within us, with a cup into which the love of God flows. This cup, however, needs to be emptied before it can be filled with Divine love. This emptying is a long process that requires courage, strength of character, determination, and, above all, sincerity. It is a process of reining in and eventually extinguishing the ego, of letting go of material needs, bad and unhealthy habits and emotional attachments in order to make room for God.

He was just, truthful, smart, pure, magnanimous and present-minded; his face was radiant as if he had lights within him to illuminate the darkest of nights; he was a great man by nature who was not educated in a school nor nurtured by a teacher as he was not in need of any of this.": "Thomas",

  "The differences between religions are reflected very clearly in the different forms of sacred art: compared with Gothic art, above all in its \u201cflamboyant\u201d style, Islamic art is contemplative rather than volitive: it is \u201cintellectual\u201d and not \u201cdramatic\u201d, and it opposes the cold beauty of geometrical design to the mystical heroism of cathedrals. Islam is the perspective of \u201comnipresence\u201d (\u201cGod is everywhere\u201d), which coincides with that of \u201csimultaneity\u201d (\u201cTruth has always been\u201d); it aims at avoiding any \u201cparticularization\u201d or \u201ccondensation\u201d, any \u201cunique fact\u201d in time and space, although as a religion it necessarily includes an aspect of \u201cunique fact\u201d, without which it would be ineffective or even absurd. In other words Islam aims at what is \u201ceverywhere center\u201d, and this is why, symbolically speaking, it replaces the cross with the cube or the woven fabric: it \u201cdecentralizes\u201d and \u201cuniversalizes\u201d to the greatest possible extent, in the realm of art as in that of doctrine; it is opposed to any individualist mode and hence to any \u201cpersonalist\u201d mysticism. To express ourselves in geometrical terms, we could say that a point which seeks to be unique, and which thus becomes an absolute center, appears to Islam\u2014in art as in theology\u2014as a usurpation of the divine absoluteness and therefore as an \u201cassociation\u201d (shirk); there is only one single center, God, whence the prohibition against \u201ccentralizing\u201d images, especially statues; even the Prophet, the human center of the tradition, has no right to a \u201cChristic uniqueness\u201d and is \u201cdecentralized\u201d by the series of other Prophets; the same is true of Islam\u2014or the Koran\u2014which is similarly integrated in a universal \u201cfabric\u201d and a cosmic \u201crhythm\u201d, having been preceded by other religions\u2014or other \u201cBooks\u201d\u2014which it merely restores.

Islam divides the world into two camps: the dar al-Islam (House of Submission) and the dar al-harb (House of War). The former are those lands which have been brought into submission to Islam; the latter are those nations which have not yet been brought into submission. This is how Islam actually views the world!By contrast, the conquest of Canaan represented God\u2019s just judgement upon those peoples. The purpose was not at all to get them to convert to Judaism! War was not being used as an instrument of propagating the Jewish faith. Moreover, the slaughter of the Canaanites represented an unusual historical circumstance, not a regular means of behavior.The problem with Islam, then, is not that it has got the wrong moral theory; it\u2019s that it has got the wrong God. If the Muslim thinks that our moral duties are constituted by God\u2019s commands, then I agree with him. But Muslims and Christians differ radically over God\u2019s nature.

  "The great point in Christianity is the search for an independent content for spiritual life which, according to the insights of its founder, could be elevated, not by the forces of a world external to the soul of man, but by the revelation of a new world within his soul. Islam fully agrees with this insight and supplements it by the further insight that the illumination of the new world thus revealed is not something foreign to the world of matter but permeates it through and through. Thus the affirmation of spirit sought by Christianity would come not by the renunciation of external forces which are already permeated by the illumination of spirit, but by a proper adjustment of man's relation to these forces in view of the light received from the world within.": "Muhammad",

And ulema have throughout Islamic history unanimously agreed that the jihad is an individual duty if the enemy destroys the Muslim countries. This was revealed by Imam Bin-Qadamah in 'Al- Mughni,' Imam al-Kisa'i in 'Al-Bada'i,' al-Qurtubi in his interpretation, and the shaykh of al-Islam in his books, where he said: 'As for the fighting to repulse [an enemy], it is aimed at defending sanctity and religion, and it is a duty as agreed [by the ulema]. Nothing is more sacred than belief except repulsing an enemy who is attacking religion and life.'On that basis, and in compliance with Allah's order, we issue the following fatwa to all Muslims:The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies -- civilians and military -- is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim. This is in accordance with the words of Almighty Allah, 'and fight the pagans all together as they fight you all together,' and 'fight them until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in Allah.'...We -- with Allah's help -- call on every Muslim who believes in Allah and wishes to be rewarded to comply with Allah's order to kill the Americans and plunder their money wherever and whenever they find it. We also call on Muslim ulema, leaders, youths, and soldiers to launch the raid on Satan's U.S. troops and the devil's supporters allying with them, and to displace those who are behind them so that they may learn a lesson....Almighty Allah also says: 'O ye who believe, what is the matter with you, that when ye are asked to go forth in the cause of Allah, ye cling so heavily to the earth! Do ye prefer the life of this world to the hereafter? But little is the comfort of this life, as compared with the hereafter. Unless ye go forth, He will punish you with a grievous penalty, and put others in your place; but Him ye would not harm in the least.

We have no right, in our present misery, to boast of past glories. But we must realize that it was the negligence of the Muslims and not any deficiency in the teachings of Islam that caused our present decay. Islam has never been a barrier to progress and science.

  "Take terrorism, one example among the methods used in that struggle. We know that leftist tradition condemns terrorism and political assassination. When the colonized uses them, the leftist colonizer becomes unbearably embarrassed. He makes an effort to separate them from the colonized's voluntary action; to make an epiphenomenon out of his struggle. They are spontaneous outbursts of masses too long oppressed, or better yet, acts by unstable, untrustworthy elements which the leader of the movement has difficulty in controlling. Even in Europe, very few people admitted that the oppression of the colonized was so great, the disproportion of forces so overwhelming, that they had reached the point, whether morally correct or not, of using violent means voluntarily. The leftist colonizer tried in vain to explain actions which seemed incomprehensible, shocking and politically absurd. For example, the death of children and persons outside of the struggle, or even of colonized persons who, without being basically opposed, disapproved of some small aspect of the undertaking. At first he was so disconcerted that the best he could do was to deny such actions; for they would fit nowhere in his view of the problem. That it could be the cruelty of oppression which explained the blind fury of the reaction hardly seemed to be an argument to him; he can't approve acts of the colonized which he condemns in the colonizers because these are exactly why he condemns colonization.Then, after having suspected the information to be false, he says, as a last resort, that such deeds are errors, that is, they should not belong to the essence of the movement. He bravely asserts that the leaders certainly disapprove of them. A newspaper-man who always supported the cause of the colonized, weary of waiting for censure which was not forthcoming, finally called on certain leaders to take a public stand against the outrages, Of course, received no reply; he did not have the additional na\u00efvet\u00e9 to insist.": "Albert",
  "The mystics have always stressed the religious aspect of Islam, the rationalists the other one. All the same, both of them have always had difficulties with Islam, simply because it cannot be put into any of their classifications. Take wudu as an example. A mystic will define it as a religious ablution with symbolic meaning. A rationalist will look upon it as a matter of hygiene only. They are both right, but only partly. The defectiveness of the mystic explanation lies in the fact that it lets the hygienic side of wudu become a mere form. Following the same logic in other questions, this approach will reduce Islam to pure religion, by eliminating all physical, intellectual, and social components from it. The rationalists take quite the opposite way. By neglecting the religious side, they degrade Islam to a political movement only, creating a new type of nationalism from it, a so called Islamic nationalism, deprived of ethical-religious substance, empty and equal to all other nationalisms in this regard. To be a Muslim in this case, does not represent an appeal or a duty, a moral or a religious obligation, or any attitude to the universal truth. It means only belonging to a group different from the other one. Islam has never been only a nation. Rather, Islam is a call to a nation, \" to enjoin the right and to forbid the wrong\" Quran- that is, to perform a moral mission.

As distinguished from rules about social orders and ways of production , moral truths are constant. The reason for this lies in the fact that the riddle had been established at the moment of creation in the \"prologue in heaven\" in the act preceding the whole of human history. Intelligence, education, and experience do not in themselves help us approach or better understand all of that.

With constant repetition of an evil or of a good action, it becomes almost impossible for a person to do the opposite, or even to think of it, so much so that while men's hearts become \"sealed\" and their eyes \"blinded\" if they do evil, their doing good produces such a state of mind that the devil himself can have no sway over it. Nevertheless, actions which create a psychological habit, however strong their influence may be, must not be construed as absolute determinants, for there is no \"point of no return\" for human behavior: genuine repentance (tauba) can turn an apparently wholly evil man into a paragon of virtue; on the other hand, although this is much more rare, an apparent paragon of virtue (even a prophet!) can turn into a near devil enmeshed in carnal pleasures .": "Fazlur",

Man experiences the world dualistically, but monism is the essence of all human thinking. Philosophy disagrees with dualism. However, this fact does not mean too much, because life, being superior to thought, may not be judged by it. In reality, since we are human beings, we are living two realities. We can deny these two worlds, but we cannot escape from them. Life does not depend too much on our understanding of it.": "Alija",
  "People belittle or ignore or even rebel against God, because they view theprocesses of nature as having self-sufficient causes, normally regarded by them asultimate. They do not realize that the universe is a sign pointing to something\"beyond\" itself, something without which the universe, with all its natural causes,would be and could be nothing.": "Fazlur",
  "There are only three integral views of the world: the religious, the materialistic, and the Islamic. They reflect three elemental possibilities (conscience, nature, and man), each of them manifesting itself as Christianity, materialism, and Islam. All variety of ideologies, philosophies, and teachings from the oldest time up to now can be reduced to one of these three basic world views. The first takes as its starting point the existence of the spirit, the second the existence of matter, and the third the simultaneous existence of spirit and matter. If only matter exists, materialism would be the only consequent philosophy. On the contrary, if the spirit exists then man also exists, and man's life would be senseless without a kind of religion and morality. Islam is the name for the unity of spirit and matter, the highest form of which is man himself. The human life is complete only if it includes both the physical and the spiritual desires of the human being. All man's failures are either because of the religious denial of man's biological needs of the materialistic denial of man's spiritual desires.": "Alija",
  "Philologists assure us that \u017culm in Arabic originally meant \"to put something out of its proper place,\" so that all wrong of any kind is injustice, i.e., an injustice against the agent himself) is, therefore, a very common term in the Qur\u2019\u0101n, with its clear idea that all injustice is basically reflexive.": "Fazlur",
  "This unstable character of man, this going from one extreme to the other, arising as it does out of his narrow vision and petty mind, reveals certain basic moral tensions within which human conduct must function if it is to be stable and fruitful. These contradictory extremes are, therefore, not so much a \"problem\" to be resolved by theological thought as tensions to be \"lived with\" if man is to be truly \"religious,\" i.e., a servant of God. Thus, utter powerlessness and \"being the measure for all things,\" hopelessness and pride, determinism and \"freedom,\" absolute knowledge and pure ignorance\u2014in sum, an utterly \"negative self-feeling\" and a \"feeling of omnipotence\"\u2014are extremes that constitute natural tensions for proper human conduct. It is the \"God-given\" framework for human action. Since its primary aim isto maximize moral energy, the Qur\u2019\u0101n\u2014which claims to be \"guidance formankind\"\u2014regards it as absolutely essential that man not violate the balance of opposing tensions. The most interesting and the most important fact of moral life is that violating this balance in any direction produces a \"Satanic condition\" which in its moral effects is exactly the same: moral nihilism. Whether one is proud or hopeless, self-righteous or self-negating, in either case the result is deformity and eventual destruction of the moral human personality.": "Fazlur",

This is where human reason appears in its most perverted forms.": "Fazlur",
  "The Qur\u2019\u0101n definitely seems optimistic about the future, while rather grim about the past It is absolutely imperative for successor civilizations and their bearer communities to study well and learn from the fate of earlier ones that have perished; or they will assuredly meet with the same fate, for \"God's law does not change\" for any people.

The two are obverse and converse of the same coin: only God can ensure the essential unity of the human race as His creation, His subjects, and those responsible finally to Him alone. The economic disparities were most persistently criticized, because they were the most difficult to remedy and were at the hear of social discord\u2014although tribal rivalries, with their multiple entanglements of alliance, enmity, and vengeance, were no less serious, and the welding of these tribes into a political unity was an imperative need. Certain abuses of girls, orphans, and women, and the institution of slavery demanded desperate reform.": "Fazlur",

The journey is only for knowledge of Allah and the whole of it lies in detachment from everything that passes away.

  "The Qur\u2019\u0101n does not appear to endorse the kind of doctrine of a radical mind-body dualism found in Greek philosophy, Christianity, or Hinduism; indeed, there is hardly a passage in the Qur'\u0101n that says that man is composed of two separate, let alone disparate, substances, the body and the soul.": "Fazlur",
  "Taqw\u0101 means to protect oneself against the harmful or evil consequences of one's conduct. If, then, by \"fear of God\" one means fear of the consequences of one's actions\u2014whether in this world or the next (fear of punishment of the Last Day)\u2014one is absolutely right. In other words, it is the fear that comes from an acute sense of responsibility, here and in the hereafter, and not the fear of a wolf or of an uncanny tyrant, for the God of the Qur\u2019\u0101n has unbounded mercy\u2014although He also wields dire punishment, both in this world and in the hereafter.": "Fazlur",
  "This idea (Taqwa)can be effectively conveyed by the term \"conscience,\" if the object of conscience transcends it. This is why it is proper to say that \"conscience\" is truly as central to Islam as love is to Christianity when one speaks of the human response to the ultimate reality\u2014which, therefore, is conceived in Islam as merciful justice rather than fatherhood. Taqw\u0101, then, in the context of our argument, means to be squarely anchored within the moral tensions, the \"limits of God,\" and not to \"transgress\" or violate the balance of those tensions or limits. Human conduct then becomes endowed with that quality which renders it \"service to God [\u2018ib\u0101da].": "Fazlur",

  "The truth is quite the contrary: the author is not an indefinite source of significations which fill a work; the author does not precede the works, he is a certain functional principle by which, in our culture, one limits, excludes, and chooses; in short, by which one impedes the free circulation, the free manipulation, the free composition, decomposition, and recomposition of fiction. In fact, if we are accustomed to presenting the author as a genius, as a perpetual surging of invention, it is because, in reality, we make him function in exactly the opposite fashion. One can say that the author is an ideological product, since we represent him as the opposite of his historically real function. (When a historically given function is represented in a figure that inverse is, one has an ideological production). The author is therefore the ideological figure by which one marks the manner in which we fear the proliferation of meaning.In saying this, I seem to call for a form of culture in which fiction would not be limited by the figure of the author\u2026": "Michel",
  "As a result, we must entirely reverse the traditional idea of the author. We are accustomed, as we have seen earlier, to saying that the author is the genial creator of a work in which he deposits, with infinite wealth and generosity, an inexhaustible world of significations. We are used to thinking that the author is so different from all other men, and so transcendent with regard to all languages that, as soon as he speaks, meaning begins to proliferate, to proliferate indefinitely.": "Michel",
  "Texts, books, and discourses really began to have authors (other than mythical, \u201csacralized\u201d and \u201csacralizing\u201d figures) to the extent that authors became subject to punishment, that is, to the extent that discourses could be transgressive. In our culture (and doubtless in many others), discourse was not originally a product, a thing, a kind of goods; it was essentially an act _ an act placed in the bipolar field of the sacred and the profane, the licit and the illicit, the religious and the blasphemous. Historically, it was a gesture fraught with risks before becoming goods caught up in a circuit of ownership.": "Michel",
  "It would seem that the author\u2019s name, unlike other proper names, does not pass from the interior of a discourse to the real and exterior individual who produced it; instead, the name seems always to be present, marking off the edges of the text, revealing, or at least characterizing, its mode of being. The author\u2019s name manifests the appearance of a certain discursive set and indicates the status of this discourse within a society and a culture. It has no legal status, nor is it located in the fiction of the work; rather, it is located in the break that founds a certain discursive construct and its very particular mode of being. As a result, we could say that in a civilization like our own there are a certain number of discourses that are endowed with the \u201cauthor-function\u201d, while others are deprived of it. A private letter may well have a signer_ it does not have an author; a contract may well have a guarantor_ it does not have an author. An anonymous text posted on a wall probably has a writer_ but not an author. The author-function is therefore characteristic of the mode of existence, circulation, and functioning of certain discourses within a society.": "Michel",

This cap was a beacon to the inquiring eyes of her family, who during these periods kept their distance, merely popping in their heads semi-occasionally, to ask, with interest, \"Does genius burn, Jo?\" They did not always venture even to ask this question, but took an observation of the cap, and judged accordingly. If this expressive article of dress was drawn low upon the forehead, it was a sign that hard work was going on; in exciting moments it was pushed rakishly askew; and when despair seized the author it was plucked wholly off, and cast upon the floor.

  "Excerpt from Ursula K Le Guin's speech at National Book AwardsHard times are coming, when we\u2019ll be wanting the voices of writers who can see alternatives to how we live now, can see through our fear-stricken society and its obsessive technologies to other ways of being, and even imagine real grounds for hope. We\u2019ll need writers who can remember freedom \u2013 poets, visionaries \u2013 realists of a larger reality.Right now, we need writers who know the difference between production of a market commodity and the practice of an art. Developing written material to suit sales strategies in order to maximise corporate profit and advertising revenue is not the same thing as responsible book publishing or authorship.Yet I see sales departments given control over editorial. I see my own publishers, in a silly panic of ignorance and greed, charging public libraries for an e-book six or seven times more than they charge customers. We just saw a profiteer try to punish a publisher for disobedience, and writers threatened by corporate fatwa. And I see a lot of us, the producers, who write the books and make the books, accepting this \u2013 letting commodity profiteers sell us like deodorant, and tell us what to publish, what to write.Books aren\u2019t just commodities; the profit motive is often in conflict with the aims of art. We live in capitalism, its power seems inescapable \u2013 but then, so did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art. Very often in our art, the art of words.I\u2019ve had a long career as a writer, and a good one, in good company. Here at the end of it, I don\u2019t want to watch American literature get sold down the river. We who live by writing and publishing want and should demand our fair share of the proceeds; but the name of our beautiful reward isn\u2019t profit. Its name is freedom.": "Ursula",

  "On Loving a Stranger:Perhaps trying, despite it seeming too idealistic - to apply a speck of your imagination and generate 10 background stories a day about the people you meet - is what could help to see that it might be in fact one of the important things in life to care for. I am fully aware of how unnatural the task and believing in it could seem but my own experience has brought me to a point where i could defend this idea (and not merely an idea but also a posture in practise) tirelessly. having experienced the exuberance and richness that can be ones personal gain from looking behind facades, showing love where it's hardest to do (and yes, it can be incredibly difficult), has taught me that the task could be an incipient of ones own integral transfiguration in addition to a gentle move towards another. Remembering how undeserving we ourselves often are of this kind of gentleness (yet very much in need of, no matter what we think of ourselves or the world) makes it easier to sacrifice the time and patience to think in a considerate manner of another, even a stranger. I see this as one of the channels into the more unfathomable depths of life: every human being (i like to think that even a fragment of them) is a new story with thousands of nuances told by life itself. To see, behind hideous apperances, another human that is not too much different from ourselves may open us up to a closer understanding of other people, ourselves, situations and then help as obtain resilience useful in debilitating times.

I believe you are a perfect and divine creation and as such your value is secure forever, no matter how many mistakes (driven by fear and misconception) you make down here.

It makes no sense to condemn you for being lost, confused, scared and stupid down here, when for the most part we all are.

If a Martian(who, we'll imagine never dies except by accident) came to Earth and saw this peculiar race of creatures-these humans who live about seventy or eighty years, knowing that death is going to come--it would look to hi like a terrible problem of psychology to live under those circumstances, knowing that life is only temporary Well, we humans somehow figure out how to live despite this problem: we laugh, we joke, we live.The only difference for me and Arlene was, instead of fifty years, it was five years. It was only a quantitative difference--the psychological problem was just the same. The only way it would have become any different is if we had said to ourselves, \"But those other people have it better, because they might live fifty years.\" But that's crazy. Why make yourself miserable saying things like, \"Why do we have such bad luck? What has God done to us? What have we done to deserve this?\"--all of which, if you understand reality and take it completely into your heart, are irrelevant and unsolvable. They are just things that nobody can know.

No, it\u2019s about pushing people beyond what\u2019s expected of them. And I believe that is a necessity. Because without it you\u2019re depriving the world of its next Armstrong. Its next Parker. Why did Charlie Parker become Charlie Parker, Andrew? ANDREW: Because Jo Jones threw a cymbal at him.FLETCHER: Exactly. Young kid, pretty good on the sax, goes up to play his solo in a cutting session, fucks up -- and Jones comes this close to slicing his head off for it. He\u2019s laughed off-stage. Cries himself to sleep that night. But the next morning, what does he do? He practices. And practices and practices. With one goal in mind: that he never ever be laughed off-stage again. A year later he goes back to the Reno, and he plays the best motherfucking solo the world had ever heard. Now imagine if Jones had just patted young Charlie on the head and said \u201cGood job.\u201d Charlie would\u2019ve said to himself, \u201cWell, shit, I did do a good job,\u201d and that\u2019d be that.

No, you say \u201cjam session\u201d. What the fuck kind of word is that? Jam session? It\u2019s a cutting session, Andrew, this isn\u2019t fucking Smucker\u2019s. It\u2019s about weeding out the best from the worst so that the worst become better than the best. I mean look around you. $25 drinks, mood lighting, a little shrimp cocktail to go with your Coltrane. And people wonder why jazz is dying.

  "And against whom is this censorship directed? By way of answer, think back to the big subcultural debates of 2011 \u2013 debates about how gritty fantasy isn\u2019t really fantasy; how epic fantasy written from the female gaze isn\u2019t really fantasy; how women should stop complaining about sexism in comics because clearly, they just hate comics; how trying to incorporate non-Eurocentric settings into fantasy is just political correctness gone wrong and a betrayal of the genre\u2019s origins; how anyone who finds the portrayal of women and relationships in YA novels problematic really just wants to hate on the choices of female authors and readers; how aspiring authors and bloggers shouldn\u2019t post negative reviews online, because it could hurt their careers; how there\u2019s no homophobia in publishing houses, so the lack of gay YA protagonists can only be because the manuscripts that feature them are bad; how there\u2019s nothing problematic about lots of pretty dead girls on YA covers; how there\u2019s nothing wrong with SF getting called \u2018dystopia\u2019 when it\u2019s marketed to teenage girls, because girls don\u2019t read SF. Most these issues relate to fear of change in the genre, and to deeper social problems like sexism and racism; but they are also about criticism, and the freedom of readers, bloggers and authors alike to critique SFF and YA novels without a backlash that declares them heretical for doing so.It\u2019s not enough any more to tiptoe around the issues that matter, refusing to name the works we think are problematic for fear of being ostracized. We need to get over this crushing obsession with niceness \u2013 that all fans must act nicely, that all authors must be nice to each other, that everyone must be nice about everything even when it goes against our principles \u2013 because it\u2019s not helping us grow, or be taken seriously, or do anything other than throw a series of floral bedspreads over each new room-hogging elephant.We, all of us, need to get critical.Blog post: Criticism in SFF and YA": "Foz",

  "In the past few years, more and more passionate debates about the nature of SFF and YA have bubbled to the surface. Conversations about race, imperialism, gender, sexuality, romance, bias, originality, feminism and cultural appropriation are getting louder and louder and, consequently, harder to ignore. Similarly, this current tension about negative reviews is just another fissure in the same bedrock: the consequence of built-up pressure beneath. Literary authors feud with each other, and famously; yet genre authors do not, because we fear being cast as turncoats. For decades, literary writers have also worked publicly as literary reviewers; yet SFF and YA authors fear to do the same, lest it be seen as backstabbing when they dislike a book. (Small wonder, then, that so few SFF and YA titles are reviewed by mainstream journals.) Just as a culture of sexual repression leads to feelings of guilt and outbursts of sexual moralising by those most afflicted, so have we, by denying and decrying all criticism that doesn\u2019t suit our purposes, turned those selfsame critical impulses towards censorship.Blog post: Criticism in SFF and YA": "Foz",
  "We have so long been subject to external criticism that we don\u2019t know how to react to internal criticism, because whereas the most enduring, positive and sensible response to the former is a united front \u2013 you shall not divide us, here we stand \u2013 responding to the latter is an entirely different ballgame.This is my fear: that as a community, we don\u2019t know how to critique ourselves, and that this is dong us damage. Criticism, and specifically the criticism of both literary publications and the mainstream press, has so long been the weapon of the enemy that our first response on seeing it wielded internally is to call it the work of traitors. We have found strength in the creation of our own conventions and the hallowing of our own legends, flourishing to such an extent that, even if we are not yet accepted into the mainstream literary establishment, we are nonetheless part of the cultural mainstream. We are written about inaccurately, yet we are written about; and if there ever was a time when the whole genre seemed a precarious, faddish endeavour, then that time is surely past.Blog post: Criticism in SFF and YA": "Foz",

  "In that moment, I feel the Prophet's canvas ceiling lift away from my head, walls flying off me, and a pressure I've never put into words hisses somewhere at the back of my mind as the size of the universe assembles itself in my mind. If I close my eyes, I can see it, the endlessness beyond my ears, and knowing I'm only in a corner of that vastness doesn't make me feel tiny. It is amazing that, though I am small and ungifted and barely educated, even I can appreciate the scale of the universe.And from this perch in space, for this moment at least, it seems unimportant whether someone made it, or if it made itself.": "Stephanie",
  "He was so close his breath touched my cheek. Staring into his eyes, I could almost forget about the nightmare. I could almost forget about Mama. Like the woods back in Virginia, his eyes changed color with his mood\u2014greener when he laughed and darker, like now, when he was angry or worried. They were kind, serious, intelligent eyes that crinkled in the corners when he smiled.": "Katherine",

  "My own drawing was a house made of books, but where there should have been a door, there was a book, and where there should have been windows, there were books, and where the chimney should have been open to let the smoke out, a book was covering the hole, so if anyone was in the house, they couldn't get out. They'd suffocate, to be found years later, a desiccated corpse still marking its place in the book it had been reading with a knobby finger bone, head caved in by an avalanche of fallen books. As I said, I liked books.": "Nova",

  "A dark voice within warned him to stop, but Aaron brushed it off. He flashed Holden a patronizing smile. \u201cAll right, then. Why not here? I have no problem giving you a fair fight, considering our history.\u201dSlowly Holden relaxed his arms. There was a dark glimpse of metal, and then he took quick aim with his right hand. The short, lonely barrel of a gun stared Aaron in the eye. Even in his surprised state, Aaron could see what he was up against. An innocuous-looking Remington 1911, its wood-grip base outdated in style, but its precision and reliability lauded throughout the years.\u201cConsidering our history,\u201d Holden said through his teeth, \u201cI have no interest in fair.": "Deidre",

As his missiles and bullets take away his enemy. All they were and will ever be. I can taste it in his whispers. See it in the tiny photograph he has taped to his console. All he thinks of amid this loveless dance. All he cares about here on the edge of forever, is her. He does not want to die. Not because he is afraid. Simply because of he cannot bear the thought of leaving her behind. And there, in that tiny moment, I envy him.": "Amie",

Sure Ena would become a Princess if she were to wed Prince Grotto. Brett also knew that the fae intended to use her for her special skills and terminate her when she proved useless. Brett wasn't sure how to help Ena move her gold and staff to somewhere safe. Hopefully, in the Hawk Fae kingdom. They didn't have U-Haul trucks in the fae world.

But she didn't stop there. \"You may sit there if it pleases you.\" She pointed to Micala's seat since he was not at the meal.

  "As we pass the mirror in the bedroom, my attention is drawn to the lovely couple in the reflection. There is a man, tall with broad shoulders. His red hair cut short. He has nothing but a towel on. In his arms is a female, slender but muscular. Her wheat colored hair is pulled back in a neat bun on top of her head. Both of their skin is smooth and flawless, a little paler than most, but still complete perfection. You can tell by the way the man holds her, he cares a lot for her. You can also tell that he is afraid of holding her too tight, not wanting to crush her smaller frame into his body.

It was the same room I remembered: the shelves, the lion-footed table, the white bass-relief of Clio.

  "Before Gabe could react, he watched helplessly as Rachel slipped backwards and out of sight into the mountainside, a crumbling wall now the only thing he could see.\u201cRachel!\u201d Gabe shouted, rushing forward.

The group now only heard Haim's cries echoing in the darkness as they drifted further away.": "Wendy",
  "Michael staggered to his feet and turned to face his worst nightmare. Baal stood before him, a smirk on his face. He wore his signature grey, pinstripe, three-piece suit, and casually twisted his pinky ring on his long and slender well-manicured finger. As it rotated Michael caught a glimpse of the rubies in the skull\u2019s eye sockets. His black hair was slicked back, the sight of his false appearance made Michael sick to his stomach.": "Wendy",
  "The smoke stung at the corners of Uri\u2019s eyes as he struggled to open them. He could hear the battle sounds all around him and smell the iron from the blood drenched warfare in the air. Much to his surprise, death had not yet claimed him. He could feel Raimie\u2019s body under his own, no warmth came from him, however, and Uri feared the worse. Over his shoulder, he heard a large blast and the earth shook under him.The trackers had obviously followed someone through. There were hundreds of designated transportation locations as part of the evacuation drill. Absolutely nobody was allowed to transport directly to a primary facility for this exact reason. If a tracker were to follow your transportation signature to the next facility, the Guardians could be nearly wiped out in one night. The secrecy of the facilities and cloaking spells were key in their safety.Uri knew if he or Raimie had any chance of surviving, he needed to get clear of the fighting and find a healer. Attempting to sit up, he braced his weight on the earth just beside Raimie\u2019s head. He quickly reconsidered as the unbearable pain shot through his side. Running his hand down to the source, he could feel the shaft of an arrow jutting out from his side; a warm wetness covered his fingertips.In the distance, Uri could hear someone crying out in agony, not a voice he recognized, yet the pain in it seemed all too familiar. Another blast rang out from behind him as Uri slumped to the ground, groaning in pain.": "Wendy",
  "When I first met him (Michael) at the beginning of the year and found out that I would have to be his lab partner in bio and the year-long series of projects in AP English, I seriously considered taking night school classes and getting a GED just to avoid him.": "Stephanie",

They'll just find me here, on my bed, on a weekend night, my dead body slumped over a homework assignment.Hopefully they'll discover me before Teeny eats my remains.": "Stephanie",
  "The thought of abandoning his friend to save himself was never an option. He collapsed, pushing even closer to Raimie. Pressing his lips against his friend\u2019s ear, he whispered, \u201cAs good a day to die as any.\u201d He would defend them until his end.": "Wendy",
  "Your powers of observation are formidable,\" Michael says and Darien giggles behind one perfectly manicured hand, like some sort of preppie geisha.": "Stephanie",
  "Gabe realized he was standing there alone, with a goofy smile on his face. Limping inside, he closed the door behind him, her words still lingering in his mind. Gabe wanted more than anything to be able to choose happiness. He wanted a rain storm to make him smile. He desired that the simple task of cooking would make him dance. To Gabe, however, it didn\u2019t seem as simple as just making a choice. He hoped her joy was contagious, because he was in uncharted territories.": "Wendy",
  "Crossing the small wooden bridge, just past the rubble, Gabe ducked off to the left and swooped underneath into hiding. Once sure he was secure, and could not be seen by those that passed overhead, Gabe collapsed on to the dirt and grass. Turning on his side, his body convulsed, and relieved itself of any food that had been in his belly. Rachel was right. He was a liability. Anyone who tried to protect him ended up paying a high price. He didn\u2019t know if his old friends were dead, but he was certain whatever fate had found them must have been bad.": "Wendy",
  "Gabe watched, holding his breath as the figure slowly turned. The body moved in an almost unnatural way as it shifted and crawled slowly on all fours across the floor. When the candlelight at last fell on the figure, Gabe could make out the auburn hair of his beloved Sophie. Her hair was matted, greasy, and hung in her face.Gabe saw her shoulders were hollow looking and her skin was almost glowing white. Gabe caught sight of Sophie\u2019s fingers, her knuckles were bloody, and her nails cracked and peeling. Instinctively, Gabe fell to his knees and crawled to Sophie. Without even giving it a thought, he grabbed her hands and pulled them closer to the light.": "Wendy",
  "The two sat quiet for a moment; Gabe unsure what to say to comfort his friend and Uri stewing in his own frustration. \u201cDamn it! It was a stupid plan!\u201d Uri swung an arm around behind himself and his bag being the nearest object in reach, swung it across the room with as much force as he could muster.": "Wendy",
  "The roar of the crowd began to grow. He heard them harmoniously stomping their feet in a rhythm that cried out for battle. Gabe glanced across the arena to several cages that were shielded by large cloaks. Whatever was inside was clearly becoming agitated by the noise of the crowd. The captive creatures began beating against the bars. Random secret shrieks and growls came from their general area.": "Wendy",
  "Uri was turned, looking at him, shouting something, but at that point, Gabe couldn\u2019t hear him. A moment later, Gabe felt like the car was spinning uncontrollably. The nausea overcame him and he seriously thought he might be sick. He looked down at Sophie to make sure she was still all right. His hands were holding her head gently, but they no longer seemed like his hands. There was a glowing, blue light coming from his palms. He began to hyperventilate. Everything went black.": "Wendy",

  "This, I think, is a little glimpse of what life could be like without my family. Home could be a place of laughter and love, a refuge. I'm filled with a terrifying weightlessness, like I've jumped off a cliff, but I know that if I don't look down, I'll be just fine.": "Heather",
  "You know those primitive tribal people who believed a camera could steal your soul? Turns out they were right.": "Heather",
  "This night felt like a last hurrah, like we could blaze our brightest, at the apex of our insane adolescence. This was our Mardi Gras before the dark days of Lent.": "Heather",
  "Somehow, the pain and rage and confusion of the past eighteen years dissolves until all that is left is this one perfect moment; unscripted, unedited, it's ours and ours alone.": "Heather",
  "He looks like the kind of boy who would jump trains, strum guitars, and pass a joint.": "Heather",
  "You can't screw up your own suicide and then expect the universe to give you presents wrapped in the skin of a wonderful boy. That's just not the way it works.": "Heather",
  "If my sister were a character in a Victorian drama, she would be the snobbish rich girl with a penchant for talking shit about everyone behind their fan.": "Heather",
  "The past is past. You tried to kill yourself. So what? I humped a couch in season twelve. We all have our skeletons.": "Heather",
  "Even Mom doesn't understand how being in front of a camera all the time twists and warps you. How one second it makes you feel unbelievably alive and the next publicly strips you down until all that's left is one big question mark.": "Heather",
  "Three stupid pieces of chocolate can't mean a lifetime away from the people I love.\" Tears streamed down my face, and my body trembled. \"I don't want to forget what I have here.\" \"I won't let that happen to you.\"\"I want it. The candy,\" I whispered, ashamed to admit it out loud and scared to death because the ache in my stomach was a hunger I'd never felt before. \"Even though I know what it is, I can't stop thinking about it.": "Cherie",
  "I'm not Bonnie\u2122 or Chloe. I'm the essence of her, the nontrademarked person the camera can never capture and my parents have no right to sign over. There is a sovereign nation encased in this skin that MetaReel can never trademark.": "Heather",
  "Protect that girl, Balthazar. She is an innocent in all of this.\u201d\u201cWhy does she want Nikolas to gain his humanity?\u201d\u201cShe believes they are in love.\u201dThe absurdity of D\u2019s words hit Balthazar square in the gut. He would have doubled over if he didn\u2019t find the reason pathetic. Thankfully, he managed to keep the laughter in his head.\u201cLove? Nikolas?": "Kate",

  "Why the hell didn't faerie food come with a warning written in bold letters: MADE IN LA LA LAND. EATING WILL OPEN YOU UP TO FAERIE ATTACKS.": "Cherie",
  "He had a face made for magazine covers. Could someone say GQ model? That razor sharp jaw and those angular features caught the light just right. If she\u2019d had a camera she wouldn\u2019t mind snapping a few pictures. And those lips\u2026she stopped. She didn\u2019t know him, and something told her she shouldn\u2019t get to know him.": "Kate",
  "You sure you're not just trying to get into my pants?\" I joked, but I was already trying to figure out what one wears to a detox session in her boyfriend's dungeon-like bedroom.": "Cherie",
  "Lip-locking with a supernatural hottie to save your little brother doesn't count as kissing.": "Cherie",
  "Oh my god! Madison, what is with you and non-human guys?": "Cherie",
  "That smoke you smell is me frying your brains every time we kiss longer than twenty-three seconds.": "Cherie",
  "He had touched her. Bare skin to bare skin. She needed a bleach wipe. She would absolutely use a bleach wipe on her leg. Even if it ate her flesh off.": "Gwenn",
  "Your dad and I have been talking.\u201d\u201cYou need to stop that. The marriage will last longer.": "Tom",
  "He didn't know Rachel very well, but assumed her behavior would be similar to most women he encountered. As soon as he stepped foot inside she would attack, not allowing him to get in a word. At least that was what he imagined.": "Wendy",
  "He knew she loved him in that moment. Gabe never wanted to be part of the holy fight, but now he was, he was not about to lose.": "Wendy",
  "Uri stood staring at him, casually looking Gabe's body up and down before saying with a sly grin, \"Well hello to you too, sexy. Does your wife know about this?\" Uri then motioned with a dainty fingertip to Gabe's ensemble.Looking down, Gabe quickly realised the robe he had grabbed to cover himself with belonged to Rachel, and much to his dismay, was far too sheer for comfort at the moment. Slipping a well laid hand into place, Gabe huffed and looked at his friend in aggravation, secretly trying not to laugh.": "Wendy",
  "Patience will be on our side.\u201d \u201cI once heard that patience is a vulture in wait to take out its prey when all seems safe.": "Cyndi",
  "He had never seen the ocean before; he knew it only as the featureless blue void between the detailed continents on his father\u2019s old globe. But now he saw that it was anything but featureless; distant blue swells rising and falling, like great lungs tasked to power the surging and receding of the foamy waves washing across the shoreline beyond them.": "Jack",
  "Until it has scared you with its endlessness, sky is just sky.": "Jenny",
  "The same beautiful receptionist greeted Christian who had met him before and she extended the same lush invitation as she had the last time. Victoria's eyes narrowed and Christian chuckled under his breath at her jealousy.\"Relax ch\u00e9rie, she's paid to do that.\" \"Well, she didn't come on to me, so obviously she's not doing her job properly,\" Victoria said. Christian laughed.": "Amalie",

  "Turns out faerie-proofing a person required a length of chain that one could find in any hardware store...": "Cherie",
  "I'm a little panicky when I realize he's not here. It's a lot easier to push down my doubt when he's with me. When I can see those eyes the color of melted chocolate and hear his deep voice that falls over me like a warm blanket on a cold night.": "Rick",
  "They don\u2019t teach kidnapping at Eton, dad": "Gwenn",
  "You\u2019re all alone. No one wants you anymore. How long did you think we would all stay? You\u2019ve killed each and every person who ever loved you. Even your children won\u2019t want you. They will see what you have done. You must be the first ward in history to treat your guardian so badly that he left you. Do you think your mistress will stay? No. Elizabeth will take what she wanted and then she will leave you too.": "S.K.N.",
  "I won\u2019t forget it,\u201d I said. \u201cI hope you meet someone perfect one day.\u201d\u201cHa\u2026yeah, that\u2019s just it. I think I already did.\u201d As we opened our doors to step out, he touched my arm. \u201cJust to be clear, if I, like, leaned over and whispered your name in your ear, still nothing?": "Laura",
  "You look incredible, Kavanagh,\u201d Quinn whispered close to my ear. \u201cAre you trying to kill me?\u201d\u201cSsshhh,\u201d I hissed. \u201cThey\u2019re going to hear you.\u201d\u201cI can\u2019t tell my date she\u2019s beautiful?\u201dI turned my head. \u201cNo. No, you can\u2019t.": "Laura",
  "For a second, I stared at the map of her veins just under the surface of her thin skin. It was like her body was trying to become diaphanous. Instead of getting harder and stronger and full of life as we age, we disappear slowly. Our skin thins and evaporates. Our nails barely coat our fingertips. Our hair falls out. We are never more see-through.": "Laura",
  "Okay, news flash. Jealousy is not something I enjoy. I hadn\u2019t felt it much before. But I\u2019d also never been in love. And I\u2019d never been 3,300 miles away from the girl I loved while some punk sat next to her on a couch. A punk who had designs on her, according to Dylan. I needed to lay eyes on this guy.": "Laura",
  "Quinn spoke their language\u2014all mystery and inside jokes, scarred souls and statement shirts. It was a beautiful moment for him\u2014in his element and completely happy.When they started playing, he leaned over and whispered in my ear. \u201cSee that guitar?\u201dI nodded.\u201cThat\u2019s a 1969 Martin D28. Hear me when I say if I had to choose between a beautiful girl and that guitar, I\u2019d choose the guitar. Natch.\u201d He took a huge gulp of water, clearly affected.\u201cNaturally,\u201d I whispered. \u201cIt could be why you\u2019re still single.": "Laura",
  "The first thing I needed, possibly the only thing, was to kiss her and I did, for as long as I could. I let us both breathe for a minute, and I perched her on a counter so I could touch the face I\u2019d missed so much. I poured every bit of frustration, anger, sadness, and worry into that kiss. Meg understood and received it all, pushing her fingers into my hair and giggling against my lips. I didn\u2019t care that anybody passing by could be watching us through the window, or that I could fall right there and sleep for a week.": "Laura",
  "Wait,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cThere\u2019s one more thing.\u201d I turned around and raised an eyebrow. His eyes were wary and he lacked his usual confidence.\u201cGo to the Winter Dance with me.": "Laura",
  "I thought back to Meg\u2019s advice about Hemingway sentences\u2014simple declarative statements that showed the truth and distilled the meaning. My first attempt at that had been cynical and messed up. I gave it a go again.Find one lost sheep.The angels rejoice.": "Laura",
  "I needed out. The Jeep wasn\u2019t fast enough. I shut it down, grabbed the keys and started running like a bear was at my heels. I couldn\u2019t even see Henry anymore through my tears so it surprised me when he caught me in his arms halfway. The first thing I did was pound on his chest and ask him why he hadn\u2019t called. The second thing I did was kiss him so hard he couldn\u2019t answer me.": "Laura",
  "Her problem is with pretty,\u201d Tennyson said. \"She thinks I\u2019ll need all these dresses in college. Like I would ever in a billion years pledge a sorority. I\u2019ll pack a few of these to be ironic, though. I can wear them to, like, truck stops at night with mascara running down my cheeks and stuff.": "Laura",
  "My dad used to say, \u2018This is what your right arm\u2019s for, son,\u2019\u201d John said. \u201cThis is the time and these are the people and I\u2019d give my right arm to be a light, a comfort, to them. I know you would, too. In whatever form it takes. Use these materials and make something great. Do it on faith, knowing you probably won\u2019t be around to see how the story ends.": "Laura",
  "Thanet is having a moment,\u201d I said, leaning forward so Quinn could see him.\u201cWhat\u2019s wrong, man?\u201d Quinn said. \u201cWere you not aware high school dances suck? That they always have sucked and they will continue sucking as long as the world turns?": "Laura",
  "He smiled and squinted at me again, tilting his head up and to the right as he stared. \u201cMaybe what I\u2019m attracted to in you is more than your looks and your brain and your humor.\u201d He leaned closer like he had a secret. \u201cIt could be your soul,\u201d he whispered.I pushed his cheek until he was squinting at the door to the kitchen instead. \u201cIs this when you tell me I\u2019m your soul mate, O\u2019Neill?": "Laura",
  "Quit worrying so much about the boards and nails of your life. Focus on the stuff that lasts.\u201d He glanced through the window toward the glowing light of the kitchen where Meg and my mom were laughing about something.": "Laura",
  "Let\u2019s go to town,\u201d Jo said. \u201cTake me to eat dinner at the hotel.\u201dI sucked in a breath and stared at her for a minute. Here she sat, her hair still wet although neatly braided, wearing an old Kiss sweatshirt, the one with the red mouth and tongue, red sweatpants, and ridiculous red pumps with black scuffs on the toes and heels.And she wanted me to take her to the Hotel Wyoming, where the rich tourists hung out. I smiled. Because it was possibly the greatest thing I\u2019d ever heard. \u201cYeah, let\u2019s go to the hotel. Grab your purse and I\u2019ll find your coat.": "Laura",
  "I didn\u2019t look at Thanet. I couldn\u2019t because he would see the hurt on my face.\u201cHe loves you,\u201d Thanet said. \u201cHe\u2019s hurting and it\u2019s not just the Quinn thing. It\u2019s being away from you and wondering if you\u2019re hurting, too. Or if you\u2019re having too much fun to hurt. What he really needed was to laugh, though. So we laughed\u2026until he cried.\u201dThat undid me. I looked at Thanet with so many questions on my lips.": "Laura",
  "The past and future are what\u2019s complicated. It\u2019s the present that\u2019s simple.": "David",
  "Shhh, it's okay Cait, Daddy will be back. I am going to take care of you, just like Uncle Drake takes care of Mommy. Shhh honey, you don't need to cry,\"Jaks whispered.": "Brei",
  "It was like being born in Germany after World War II, being from Japan after Pearl Harbor, or America after Hiroshima. History was a bitch sometimes. You couldn't change where you were from. But still, you didn't have to stay there.": "Kami",
  "Reading always calmed me down: filling my head with other - made up - people's problems and conflicts made my own seem less terrible, less real.": "Heather",
  "Pulling me into his arms, he trailed light kisses from my ear to my neck, almost making me forget how late I was running.I pushed him away. \u201cYou better stop that, or we\u2019re never getting out of here.\u201d\u201cMy thoughts exactly.": "Alyssa",
  "I've never been in love, but if a penguin can find a soul mate, I'm sure I can, too.": "Rebekah",
  "Did you just mentally pistol whip that guy, with his own gun? Nice, Amber. I would have just killed him.": "Elle",
  "Kissing is something that makes up for a whole lot of the other crap you have to put up with in school, and as a teenager in general": "Maureen",
  "Rourk didn\u2019t even know her name, but he knew he\u2019d never seen anyone so magnificent in his life. Her wavy hair glistened in the sunlight. She had a delicate, round face with large, blue-green eyes and full lips. With her cheeks flushed from the cold fall air, she reminded him of a porcelain doll. He knew that her looks deceived; her bold, daring eyes gave her away. She constantly observed her surroundings. Rourk smiled to himself; soon they would be together.": "Julia",
  "Hold still, Meg, you\u2019re dripping blood on my car seats.\u201dI reached behind the passenger seat of Tennyson\u2019s car looking for the white sheet she\u2019d thrown in for mopping up bodily fluids. Quinn, sitting in the back seat, read my mind and handed it to me. \u201cThank you.\u201d\u201cNo problem.\u201d He leaned forward, pulling a corner of the sheet up to wipe off a small stream of blood on my neck. \u201cYou okay?": "Laura",
  "But Quinn held the fuzzy handcuffs in his hands, looking them over closely, and he smiled. \u201cOh, hey, did you want to keep these for when your invisible boyfriend returns from his fake vacation?": "Laura",
  "That\u2019s when I realized it. I liked this girl. A lot. I liked her super-moist double chocolate chip cupcakes. I liked how kind and patient she was with the guests, the way her forehead crinkled when she was thinking about a problem. I liked her low, soft voice and that long ribbon of platinum-blond hair. I liked the way she looked at the world, as if it were an okay place, where good things were actually possible.\u00a0": "Anne",

  "Getting up from the bed, Dominick approaches me at a slow predatory pace. Once again, I cannot move my feet.": "Elle",
  "Sara, we have to go,\" she whispers, even though my dad isn't there to hear her. She's not crying. She's calm. Matter-of-fact. As if she's asking me whether I want mayo or mustard on my sandwich. Except in secret.": "Tracy",
  "I recognized Meg\u2019s swirly handwriting and crooked my index finger into the side of the envelope to rip it open. There was no letter. Just a picture. A picture of Meg holding a picture of me. The word HOME echoed through my body like a rifle shot.": "Laura",
  "You\u2019re kidding, right? The whole town will know where we are just by the idle on that thing.\u201dHe feigned a look of shock. \u201cThat thing is a 1966 GTO. It has a name, okay? It\u2019s Mack\u2014as in \u2018to mack on women.\u2019 I rebuilt it last year, and I was told the engine makes girls hot.\u201d\u201cSomeone actually used those words? Is it true?\u201d\u201cTBD,\u201d he said.\u201cYou\u2019re goofy. Let\u2019s ride in my Jeep. Its name is Jeep.\u201d Quinn chuckled. \u201cKavanagh has a smart mouth.": "Laura",
  "I said you were beautiful. I slept in your bed!": "Stephanie",
  "Her primary reason for living and my primary reason for living were awfully entangled.": "John",
  "I bought you love poetry! 'I love you as certain dark things are loved, secretly, between the shadow and the soul.'\" I blink at him. \"Neruda. I starred the passage. God,\" he moans. \"Why didn't you open it?": "Stephanie",
  "You're the most incredible girl I've ever known. You're gorgeous and smart, and you make me laugh like no-one else can. And I can talk to you. And I know after all this I don't deserve you, but what I'm trying to say is that I love you, Anna. Very Much.": "Stephanie",
  "I trail my fingers across his cheek. He stays perfectly still for me. \"Please stop apologizing, Etienne.\"\"Say my name again,\" he whispers.I close my eyes and lean forward. \"Etienne.\"He takes my hands into his. Those perfect hands, that fit mine just so. \"Anna?\"Our foreheads touch. \"Yes?\"\"Will you please tell me you love me? I'm dying here.\"And then we're laughing. And then I'm in his arms, and we're kissing, at first quickly - to make up for lost time - and then slowly, because we have all the time in the world. And his lips are soft and honey sweet, and the careful, passionate way he moves them against my own says that he savors the way I taste, too.And in between kisses, I tell him I love him.Again and again and again.": "Stephanie",
  "It's hard as hell to hold onto your dignity when the risen sun is too bright in your losing eyes, and that's what I was thinking about as we hunted for bad guys through the ruins of a city that didn't exist.": "John",

  "Sitting on the train I watch the scenery speeding by, notice a cobweb in the top corner of the window, undulating with a gentle breeze I can\u2019t feel. I lean back in my seat and take my book out of the carrier bag. Turning it over in my hand, it feels warm. It feels how I want to feel; full of knowledge, full of the future.The time I\u2019ve spent staying in bed smoking dope I\u2019ve been hibernating, recuperating and gaining strength. I\u2019m weak socially, but being away from other drug users has made me resilient. It\u2019s allowed my mind and body to heal and mend. As if the winter is over, I\u2019ve come out stronger now. I\u2019m on my own. I have the choice of what to do with my life.I\u2019m going to stay clean. I\u2019m going to be the woman I can be.": "Christine",
  "Sitting cross-legged on her bed, I watch her take out her gear. She\u2019s been smoking so much the room stinks of it. Over the last few weeks, I\u2019ve seen her do it so often I\u2019ve resisted the urge. It\u2019s surreal, like I\u2019m watching me from outside my body. My willpower is fragile at the best of times, but my resolve is always weaker in the evening.I feel a dread and a revulsion for what I\u2019m about to do, but there\u2019s a stronger feeling, an unutterable longing. I crack.\u2018Give us a line,\u2019 I say.": "Christine",
  "We are in a boy recession,\" Eugene repeats. \"There's been a sudden, drastic decrease in the male population at this school. And I'm gonna take advantage of it.": "Flynn",

  "But the thought of moving on from something I never had is depressing.": "Susane",
  "I just read this great quote by Junot Diaz, he was talking about true intimacy, and he was saying that it was the willingness to be vulnerable and to be found out. That\u2019s what I felt that YA did. It wasn't pretentious, and it wasn\u2019t hiding its heart. It wanted to be found out...It felt like those moments when you go to a party and you're standing around for a long time, going, I don't fit in here, what am I going to talk to these people about? And everybody's getting drunk, and then you find this one person, and you end up sitting in some corner talking about all these arcane things.And then before you know it you're having a conversation about the meaning of life and it's four o\u2019clock in the morning. That kind of feeling, that kind of intimacy \u2014 I felt like that's what I got from YA.": "Libba",

It\u2019s one of my favorite books.\u201dHot and smart. And apparently he was a real-life boy.": "Jennifer",

  "I think sometimes in literature we kind of police ourselves. I know a lot of people talked about Twilight, and they would say, oh, but the heroine, she lets this man make her decisions. And I thought, that may not be the particular fantasy or trope that works for me.But listen man, I read Wuthering Heights. I wanted me a little Heathcliff action. I mean, why can't we indulge that fantasy and also be like, \u201cAnd now I would like the ERA passed, please. Also, this lipstick is fuckin' killer.": "Libba",

  "Jenna walked in between desks and plonked herself down behind hers, noticing AGAIN that the teacher hadn\u2019t graced the class with his zitty presence. She thought Mr. Kennan needed to get fired, which said a lot, because she rarely paid attention to ugly teachers. She\u2019d discussed this with the principal two weeks back when she\u2019d been sent to his office after getting caught sleeping. She\u2019d told him that if he employed more hot teachers like Mr. Daniels then maybe she wouldn\u2019t pass out from boredom. The principal gave her a week\u2019s detention because of that comment, saying that she needed to take things more seriously.

I worry we won't ever get a chance and it's driving me out of my skull.\"No, no, no, no.........We stared at each other. The tiny space between us felt too hot. Muscles bulged on his naked frame.

It's not like I expected you to be happy to see me. I was just\u2026 you know, hoping\u2026 coffee. Tea. Chance to talk. Or some shit. Friends, maybe.

  "It was you,\" I say softly. \"It's always you I think about.\"The intensity in his gaze took my breath away. I could feel him. Every part of him. His soul was sewn to mine.

  "I think you\u2019re my hero,' she said. Only half-kidding.He stared at her, the picture of incredulity. 'Most people,' he said, 'think I am a very bad man.'She studied his eyes to try to find out if that bothered him. He didn\u2019t seem bothered by them. He seemed discomfited by her.

  "The fear, momentarily paused, returned with full force, and in this frantic, baffled state I ran to him, and leapt into his arms. He seemed surprised at first but soon was squeezing back. \"It's all right,\" he soothed. \"No one's hurt. You're okay.\"His words sliced through me, and for the first time since he'd taken me from school, I knew the truth about us: I could not be okay if he was not okay.

  "And you're not leaving,\" she said. \"Promise me.\"It was as if she had asked him to promise to keep breathing, to notice sunshine, to permit the spinning of the earth. What choice did he have? Even if he left her, she would be camped in his heart, an insistent and willful presence. She would match her strides to his on any journey he ever took; she would lie beside him on any bed.Amalie, he said, \"that's the easiest promise I've ever had to make.": "Sharon",

Of course I did not come over here to see you. How could you think such a thing That would be disobedient.\u201d I held up the wax. \u201cFor my own disobedience I have to buff the boat. Then I\u2019m going for a jog.\u201d She tilted her head. Probably her eyes widened but I couldn\u2019t see them behind her sunglasses. I hated not being able to see her eyes. She asked \u201cIn this heat?\u201d I didn\u2019t mind jogging in the heat. The heat was a big friendly animal that liked to wrestle and only occasionally sat on me until I lost my breath. Anyway she was missing the point. I repeated carefully \u201dI am GOING for a JOG.\u201d \u201cI HEARD you the FIRST time \u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s late afternoon in the middle of June.

  "Uninvited, the thought of you stayed too late in my head,so I went to bed, dreaming you hard, hard, woke with your name,like tears, soft, salt, on my lips, the sound of its bright syllableslike a charm, like a spell.Falling in loveis glamorous hell; the crouched, parched heartlike a tiger ready to kill; a flame's fierce licks under the skin.Into my life, larger than life, beautiful, you strolled in. I hid in my ordinary days, in the long grass of routine,in my camouflage rooms. You sprawled in my gaze,staring back from anyone's face, from the shape of a cloud,from the pining, earth-struck moon which gapes at meas I open the bedroom door. The curtains stir. There you areon the bed, like a gift, like a touchable dream.\"You": "Carol",

A third time, I got up and dressed,and when I came home, you sprawled on my breast,for the dazzling story I told.Give me,the hedgerows, give me the fields,I slid from the warmth of our sheets, and when I returned, to kiss you from sleep,you stirred at the story I told.give me the silvery cold,of the moon. I pulled on my boots and my coat,but when i came back, moonlight on your throatoutshone the story I toldGive me, you howledon our sixth night together, the wind in the trees.You turned to the wall as I left,and when I came home, I saw you were deafto the blustering story I told.Give me the sky, all the spaceit can hold. I left you, the last night we loved,and when I returned, you were gone with the gold,and the silver, the river, the forest, the fields,and this is the story I\u2019ve told.\"Give": "Carol",

His hands are warm, caressing my pale skin. His deep-blue eyes are filled with serenity and passion. I keep telling myself to breathe, but I am unable to exhale the air from my lungs. Then he leans forward and his lips touch mine, increasing the temperature in my body. He kisses me gently, trying to break his way through, testing to see if I let him in.
