  "With Tinder and all these other things, there's always this kind of illusion with infinite choices. There's something very cool about saying, 'Oh, I actually really care about this person, and I want to commit to loving this person and being loyal to this person.' You can't get that from the kind of infinite multiple choices that are out there.": "John",
  "My style is pretty clean, classic, and elegant, with some elements to make it a little funkier. If you see me on a normal day, I'm usually in a T-shirt and jeans, maybe with some cool sneakers, but I'm pretty basic.": "John",
  "I sang 'All Of Me' at the wedding. I sang 'Stay With You' from my first album. And then Stevie Wonder came up and sang 'Ribbon In the Sky.' It was impromptu... It was cool... He's always been a friend and a mentor to me.": "John",
  "With 'Transparent'. When Amazon put 'Transparent' up, along with 'Bosch' and a few other things, I watched them, and I thought it was an interesting exercise. I didn't comment on them, but I was like, 'Okay, this is kind of cool.'": "Kevin",
  "We got to do a few things with President Clinton. To be invited to Washington again to play with Ashanti and all those other cool people there in front of President Bush and the rest of the world feels awesome. I'm really looking forward to going.": "Darius",
  "I've been a Robert Randolph fan forever, since 2001. I just thought he was so cool; you don't see a black kid playing the slide the way he plays. No one plays like Robert.": "Darius",
  "I didn't know I was cool, but I was very flattered that some of the younger comedy writers came up to talk to me at the Emmys. I found that gratifying.": "Bob",
  "Kids all want to look cool, as if knowledge is a great burden, but they're always looking around. They remember.": "Frank",
  "I did find some time to go to a record store and check out 'Headstrong' actually in the racks. It was pretty cool I never thought I'd see my own CD sitting there with everyone else's. I made my Mom take lots of pics! ": "Ashley",
  "One of my intentions with 'Rookie' is for the girls reading it to know that they are already cool enough and smart enough and pretty enough.": "Tavi",
  "So much about 'Rookie' has been very organically familial among our contributors, among our readers. Yeah, if I interview someone like Lorde, who I do know outside of work - sometimes I'm just so happy; it's so cool that this is organically, effortlessly, the warm, supportive friend vibe that we want here.": "Tavi",
  "One of my favorite things I read was John Steinbeck's journals while he was writing 'East of Eden,' which was so cool.": "Paul",
  "When I was a very young actor, I cruised around in a pretty cool vehicle called the Starship Enterprise.": "George",
  "I'd love to date somebody cool, fun, funny.": "Rihanna",
  "I don't know anybody as creative and unique and off the wall as Dia Frampton. She's always asking me, 'Am I too weird?' I just tell her, 'People don't think you're weird, they think you're cool.'": "Blake",
  "I would be lying if I said it wasn't cool to see myself on the cover of 'Vanity Fair,' right? It's, like, what am I doing there? This is bizarre.": "Megyn",
  "Awkwardness gives me great comfort. I've never been cool, but I've felt cool. I've been in the cool place, but I wasn't really cool - I was trying to pass for hip or cool. It's the awkwardness that's nice.": "Marc",
  "When I was working on pictures with my father, there were a couple leading ladies to whom I wish I'd expressed how I felt rather than being too cool or too shy.": "Michael",
  "I'm on the younger end of Gen X, and for me, growing up gay was not cool.": "Jillian",
  "The one person who's disappeared out of the business is the A&R man. Because the listener at home becomes the A&R man. He's the one who chooses what tracks he wants on the album. And that's cool.": "Jimmy",
  "I think most people think of ballerinas as kind of either as a fairytale, far-away thing that's really not attainable, something they can't grasp, or they think of them as European or Russian and kind of their nose up in the air. So, it's cool for me to, like, sit with them and for them to really see themselves as me.": "Misty",
  "For relatively modest amounts of sulfur dioxide injected into the atmosphere, you could easily cool Earth by 1% or more, if you want.": "Nathan",
  "If I say I've got two versions of Word - that old one from 1982 that's perfect, with zero defects; or the new one that's got all this cool new stuff, but there might be a few bugs in it - people always want the new one. But I wouldn't want them to operate a plane I was on with software that happened to be the latest greatest release!": "Nathan",
  "Opening Ceremony is my number one favorite place to shop here. It's the only place I'll shop in New York with my son. All of the sales people are so cool; the music is great; it's just like a big fun house, so he stays entertained.": "Solange",
  "Even though my father was a radio comedian, it wasn't cool to say, at a young age, 'I want to be a comedian.'": "Albert",
  "My roots were in acting. That's all I wanted to be. Even though my father was a radio comedian, it wasn't cool to say, at a young age, 'I want to be a comedian.'": "Albert",
  "I'm still a student of fashion, but I like hooking up with the people that really know how to make cool clothes.": "Olivia",
  "I really enjoy being part of the Marvel Universe. It's a cool bunch of people to work with, and they know what they're doing.": "Stellan",
  "You'd be surprised the type of people who are into metal when you see them. Sometimes I'm even surprised, but it's cool. That's the reason it's still around.": "Glenn",
  "Back in the days, we had to work with a shoestring budget. We had a movie screen, and we'd show movie trailers on them, and then we'd rip through it and started playing. Now we have a little money to play with to do a cool stage set.": "Glenn",
  "When your car rattles when you drive, you know you are playing cool music.": "Glenn",
  "Like most people in radio - and in magic - I'm not cool. I know people who are hip, and I can feel distance between them and me.": "Ira",
  "I started out doing production work on promos, stuff like that. I didn't think it was cool to be working for NPR. I didn't need anything to be cool. I just wanted something to do that would be interesting. It was fun. I didn't think of it as anything else but fun.": "Ira",
  "Let's be honest. Canada wasn't ever cool.": "The",
  "I want to make pop cool again, and the only way I can do that is by being ambitious and grand.": "The",
  "In high school I had a boyfriend who was super into rap, so I was into Too $hort and Wu-Tang for a little while. And my best friend's older brother would sometimes drive us home in this pimped-out truck, and he'd play all his dirty rap music. We thought we were really cool.": "Kirsten",
  "My high school didn't have a football team; we just had like a surf team, because I grew up in Encinitas, California, which is the ultimate place where everyone skated or surfed, so it was a very different culture. It was, like, cool to be the art kid.": "Emily",
  "I met Patti Smith, which is not Hollywood, but that really blew my mind. I love her. We were at a very small party, too, on a boat, and I totally fanned out. I told her that I loved her, and wasn't cool at all.": "Emily",
  "I like to buy girls shoes and jewelry. I buy stupidly expensive shoes. I got Louboutins for my mom and my girlfriend before. My mom was like, 'I can't wear these; they're too high.' I was like, 'Mom, you have to try them - they're so cool. They're red snakeskin!' She still wears them every so often, but she can't walk in them.": "Ansel",
  "Being an Australian that's been No. 1 in the world back home playing in Australia, that's a pretty cool moment to have.": "Jason",
  "I think it's really cool to embrace the pain of something that may have hurt you and be able to express it through music.": "Ciara",
  "It's one thing to really dream and have a vision and want all these cool things, but it's a whole other thing when you actually have wisdom and understand things. Then you can truly make the best decisions.": "Ciara",
  "I think cool moments like winning a Grammy deserve a nice little party where you really soak it in and not have to work and stuff. I do remember throwing a party on that Grammy night, but it was work.": "Ciara",
  "I'm Brian a lot more than I'm Paul Walker, which is awesome. When I hear, 'Hey Paul Walker!' my hair stands up on the back of my neck. It's uncomfortable. But when I hear, 'It's Brian!' it's cool. I like Brian.": "Paul",
  "When you're on the pop treadmill, you don't always feel that cool because you have to do things to promote the record that aren't necessarily your environment.": "Paloma",
  "I've always had a big personality. I was trickier as a kid. I behaved erratically instead of consistently. I would have tons of friends, and then I would have no friends. I'd be with the cool girls, then the uncool girls. I migrated from group to group because I was bored or people got bored with me. I was very intense.": "Chelsea",
  "I love being in the studio. Expressing myself that way is really cool.": "Keke",
  "Working with Ice Cube was so tight. He's cool, and I really like how he does family stuff. My guy friends couldn't believe I was chillin' with him. Dudes love Ice Cube.": "Keke",
  "I named my album 'So Uncool' because it defies the ordinary: you're different from everyone else. It's like, being uncool makes you cool because you're different!": "Keke",
  "I love my bubble skirt. I wear it with a belt and my shirt tucked in. Just like a t-shirt from Nordstrom's or something. And I wear this navy blue blazer with the sleeves crushed up. And I just feel like I'm such a cool girl when I walk out. I feel like, 'Yeah I'm cool, like a model.'": "Keke",
  "Working with crocodiles is always amazing because they're beautiful. They're modern day dinosaurs, which is really cool.": "Bindi",
  "I am surprised by how not-adopted the video reply has been. What keeps other people from doing it, I think, is that they think a video comes across as 'I'm cool, look at how many e-mails I get.' That perception doesn't scare me, because I know who I am.": "Gary",
  "People are more comfortable learning about wine because now they can just Google, you know, 'Soave,' and say, 'Oh, O.K., cool.'": "Gary",
  "When I was younger, I had a perm, and it was really big. My mom was a hairdresser, so even my dad had a perm! I looked like a poodle, but it was cool at the time.": "Heidi",
  "It was an event whenever 'CHiPs' would come on in my house. There wasn't a lot of Latin people being hired to star in TV shows or movies back in the day. Not only was it a fun show, there was a Latino starring in it - so we thought it was extra cool.": "Michael",
  "Kicks to the legs, they're not very cool. They're brutal.": "Michael",
  "I remember I used to think my dad was really cool working at a factory. He used to make buttons. I used to brag, 'This button here, My dad made it.' There was this sense of pride. It's knowing your dad is doing something cool.": "Michael",
  "My dad is a great writer. Naturally talented, naturally charming. He embodies that back-in-the-day cool.": "Drake",
  "When I first moved to Vail, it was like I was a little celebrity. You know, everyone knew my accomplishments. I was a young, fast teenager and making waves in the ski world. And it was really cool.": "Lindsey",
  "I'm obsessed with the 1920s, everything from the style to the lifestyle. It was a really cool era.": "Lauren",
  "Touring is very routine. You get to the city, you go to the hotel, you got to be at the hotel by a certain time - it's very routine. I'm not a very structured person, so when I get some structure, it's cool; it's good for me.": "J.",
  "Every night I fell asleep to a different Beatles album. So I'm very familiar with the Beatles Ringo was my favorite Beatle until I grew up and then changed. I made the switch over to George Harrison just in time to regain my cool. ": "Christina",
  "Once Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings are not cool on country radio, it's time for a new format.": "Steven",
  "That point of life when I learned I could cook, that always made me understand what cooks felt like feeding other people. It's okay to receive, but it's really cool to give, so food is to me sexy because it's the fact that someone is giving it to someone else.": "Omari",
  "I really had a problem with being 'the man.' I'm past it now, but that was my insecurity. I ran from that. I was cool with being No. 3 on the call sheet or No. 2.": "Omari",
  "Whenever we can, we try to talk to students. If I can, I'll invite kids from a school to a sound check and take questions from them. I want to show them it's cool to play the trombone. Kids are influenced by what's accessible to them. It's hard for kids to be introduced to music other than what they see on TV and video.": "Trombone",
  "Whenever I go jamming, people are looking to cut me. The young ones learn my stuff and come play it at me, and I have to learn other stuff. I feel a lot of pressure. But it's cool. It's a good pressure.": "Trombone",
  "My mom used to model when she was younger, before she went to law school, and I think she thought it was pretty cool. I think my parents saw that acting ultimately made me happy, even though it was a rough ride for a little bit.": "Alexandra",
  "When I was 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, I had so many people I looked up to and was so inspired by all these different people. It's cool to be in that position.": "Alexandra",
  "There is nothing better than a really cool mystery: you don't know what's going to happen, so you keep turning those pages or watching that series.": "Alexandra",
  "It's cool to be a female character who gets to be really strong and tough.": "Alexandra",
  "You remember where you were doing each scene. 'Oh my God, it was so hot that day.' It's kind of cool to see a movie that you haven't seen in a long time and reflect on that stuff.": "Alexandra",
  "I always wanted to be a blonde, and it was really cool to do that for a while.": "Alexandra",
  "The idea of recognising your strengths and using them in as versatile a way as you can is cool to me.": "Frank",
  "I thought it'd be cool to start my own university, in a way.": "Ashton",
  "I've been watching 'Walking Dead' with my son, and there is absolutely nothing in there I find shocking, but it's cool, and I like it.": "Mads",
  "I like 'The Three Musketeers.' I like those kind of cool things where they were having a robe and a sword.": "Mads",
  "Whether you are a consumer, a hardware maker, a software developer or a provider of cool new services, it's hard to make a move in the American cellphone world without the permission of the companies that own the pipes.": "Walt",
  "I wasn't always the most fashionable, and I would come to school with cauliflower ear and ringworm. I got made fun of a lot. People called me 'Miss Man' and 'Guns,' and people directed a lot of karate jokes at me. I wish that I was at school now that MMA and martial arts is cool, but back when I was in school, people associated it with nerdy stuff.": "Ronda",
  "I have to be out there to sell these fights; it's not because I really enjoy getting made up and going to work every day. It's cool, it's an awesome job, but it's still a job. I'm doing it because it helps me make a living and not because I'm so extremely vain that I want to see my face everywhere.": "Ronda",
  "I like the new, cool, swinging Justin Timberlake.": "Roger",
  "Our mission for younger people is to do our best to make exercise cool, hip - the thing to do.": "Caitlyn",
  "All of my relationships have happened organically with people who are super cool and in my life and it just moved into a relationship zone.": "Hannah",
  "It is so cool to think that there are two female, Indian actresses on prime-time American network television who are considered attractive and funny and smart.": "Hannah",
  "I grew up on Loretta Lynn and Dusty Springfield. I remember lying about it it wasn't cool to listen to country when I was 12. ": "Jenny",
  "In early high school years, I was pretty chubby, and I spent a lot of time on my computer, before it was cool to have a computer - because there was a time that was true. So that's where I developed my personality.": "Rashida",
  "I'm friends with a lot of my exes, but it took time. We didn't just get into it. I don't think you can be friends until you're cool with them dating someone else. That's when you know.": "Rashida",
  "Growing up, I really liked 'Star Wars.' Han Solo would've been really cool to meet. But my stuff was real low-brow. I was watching 'Bugs Bunny.'": "Chris",
  "I really like women who get emotional about babies and puppies. I've met some incredibly cool women who are tough, but the woman you marry should have a really soft side.": "Chris",
  "What a contrast, Trump is feisty but flexible. Obama, cool but rigid. But he had no reason to bend. The media already bought into his shtick. His giddy fan base ate up every white-coated lie.": "Greg",
  "For the better part of my adult life, I proudly avoided nerd/nimrod/goober status. I was always just cool enough.": "Steve",
  "My parents were really, really cool about supporting what I wanted to do at a really young age. I think I was about 10 when I caught the bug. They would drive me down to New York if there were auditions. When I was 12, I did this show on Broadway called 'High Society,' so we moved to New York for the run of that.": "Anna",
  "I feel like you can't get an audience to like your character if she's actually cool, but you can if she's trying to be cool and sometimes fails.": "Anna",
  "Competition is great. And as long as it's friendly and not a malicious thing, then I think it's cool.": "Janet",
  "I'm kind of the model that everyone thought would always be the Guess, 'Sports Illustrated' girl. Then, when I started to do high fashion stuff... people were like, 'Oh, so we can have a girl with, like, thighs and a butt in a Tom Ford campaign. Cool.'": "Gigi",
  "Rag & Bone is a big part of my closet. I just really like how their jeans fit; I wear them a lot, and I think they make really cool staple pieces.": "Gigi",
  "High school is when I started to get my sense of fashion together. My queen was Candice Swanepoel, who is a friend of mine now, which is kind of funny, but in high school, I was obsessed. I love her street style: she is always in cool boyfriend jeans, boots, and an awesome coat, which is very much like what I wear.": "Gigi",
  "Cate Blanchett and others, they get this broad range of all these cool people they can play. Some women really do get it all. For me, it is the same thing that happens over and over. I should change that and maybe write my own thing.": "Jennifer",
  "In a movie, that's the only time when you're allowed these kind of fantasies to be lived. Being able to look so cool and be able to fight five bad guys and take them down. When can you do that?": "Michelle",
  "Tech companies approach you to hold something in a picture and then say, 'This is what I want you to write on your Twitter.' There are people who get away with that and look really cool doing it, but I'm just not one of them.": "Alexa",
  "My whole family actually, but my parents. I had such a normal and amazing childhood. I've been so lucky. My parents are cool and normal. They don't talk about the business and I still have stuff to do at their house.": "Kaley",
  "I wouldn't say I was bullied, but I was definitely a bit of an outcast. It was more the kids thinking I thought I was cool. I started homeschooling in fifth grade, and I was much happier.": "Kaley",
  "I had such a normal and amazing childhood. I've been so lucky. My parents are cool and normal. They don't talk about the business, and I still have stuff to do at their house.": "Kaley",
  "I think we all have different moods - a nerd one day and cool the next. I think everyone has an inner geek, and I know I definitely do.": "Kaley",
  "I like Penny. She's cool. Yeah, she dates some idiots, but, although, so have I. So yeah, I would be friends with her. We'd have a lot to talk about.": "Kaley",
  "I didn't watch much TV as a kid and I don' t watch it now. I don' t find anything beautiful or unique to the medium, and the only thing you can do on TV that you can't do in film is make a continuing story - which is so cool!": "David",
  "I love Bob Dylan. Who doesn't? He tapped into some kind of vein and it keeps on keeping on. There's nobody like him. He's unique, and just... way out cool.": "David",
  "I think it's so cool to be tall. Even when I'm not wearing heels people tell me I'm tall and I always take it as a complement. The good thing is I can always see everybody in the room.": "Maria",
  "I got into the whole Ayurvedic thing. It was really cool.": "Parker",
  "It's not really cool to be singled out.": "Parker",
  "I've never been cool and I don't really care about being cool. It's just an awful lot of time and hair gel wasted.": "Chris",
  "I don't mind not being cool.": "Chris",
  "We aren't cool and never will be.": "Chris",
  "Being voted the world's sexiest vegetarian is about as cool as it gets. It's not quite as cool as Brad Pitt, but it'll do.": "Chris",
  "There are a lot of movies about misfits that are quite cool, that kind of glamorize it on some level. I think there are fewer films, certainly with a lady at the center, about the agony of what it's like to feel like you're not accepted, and you're different, and somehow you're weird.": "Rebecca",
  "Icy and earthy, Helen Mirren is a rare, regal presence in a movie age that values the plebeian over the patrician and mass over class. Lauded with an Oscar and an Emmy for playing both Queen Elizabeths, Mirren has matched her cool aristocracy with a boldness of performance and display.": "Richard",
  "In the movies, every crazy old fart needs a cool old car. Jack Nicholson drove a spiffy yellow 1970 Dodge Challenger two-door in 'The Bucket List.' In 'Gran Torino,' the cranky pensioner played by Clint Eastwood not only owned a 1972 GT Sport, he also used to build cars like that at the Ford plant.": "Richard",
  "I love being not cool.": "Rufus",
  "I don't feel like songs should be hoarded. I don't feel like one's tainted if somebody else does it. That's the mark of artistry - take a song that's maybe even a really popular song and do it your own way. I think that's cool.": "Chris",
  "When you're writing with an artist or for an artist, you have to help them serve their vision. That's the cool part about writing songs. There are no rules.": "Chris",
  "If I'm the biggest artist in the world, cool, but I want to just be me.": "Future",
  "I try to look cool. I strategize. Sometimes it's like - that's part of the strategizing, to make it seem like I don't think about it.": "Future",
  "I really liked the snake that breaks out of the cage in the beginning of the movie. I saw it in real life, and it was really cool. Really big and fat. The owls are cool as well, but you can't really pet them.": "Tom",
  "Draco's not really a bully. He's not exactly the biggest, strongest guy in the world. He's more a rich, snobby person. He thinks of himself as really cool.": "Tom",
  "I would miss months of school and then return with bright blond hair. Needless to say, there was bullying. I wasn't beaten up daily, but there was name-calling and jealousy. You have to bear in mind that 'Harry Potter' wasn't cool. I wasn't part of the 'Terminator' franchise.": "Tom",
  "I started on the clarinet. I was going to a music school - my mother took me - and the guy said, 'What do you want to play?' I said the drums, and my mother said, 'No, you don't. You don't want to play the drums.' So I said, 'Maybe the trumpet would be cool.' And my mother said, 'I don't think so.' And then the clarinet was handed to me.": "Christopher",
  "My wife is cool enough to let me write about personal things, to be a songwriter exploring the shadowy sides of love.": "Dierks",
  "My friends in Paris are writers, or something like that, whereas my friends in New York are doing cool stuff in finance and living very different lives. In writing, it's pretty solitary, so it doesn't really matter who's around.": "Whit",
  "Houston is kind of a melting pot. There are many different cultures and ethnicities represented out there, even on my team. It's really cool: you'll see so many different things.": "J.",
  "Obviously, you get to do a lot of great things and cool opportunities at the Super Bowl. But at the end of the day, we all want to be here as a player. That's the goal, and that's why I work so dang hard.": "J.",
  "Growing up, you'd see Michael Jordan on everything from Gatorade to shoes - everything. Obviously, that's something pretty cool for an athlete to aspire to.": "J.",
  "The one thing I know is, if I play good ball, things have tended to come along with it. Everything that I've ever done in my career has come off of playing good football. And so I realize I need to go out there, and I need to take care of my business; then everything else - all these cool, great things - come along with it.": "J.",
  "People always ask, 'Man, why don't you come out and enjoy it? Why don't you celebrate? Why don't you have any fun?' My fun is Sundays. Anybody can go to the club. You don't have to be good at going to the club to go to the club. You have to be good to be playing on Sundays, and to me, that's what's cool.": "J.",
  "It makes no difference to my family where one comes from as long as we make each other happy. They are pretty cool like that.": "Amy",
  "I'm not really as cool and collected as 'Mrs. Funnybones', but she is the woman I want to be.": "Twinkle",
  "I want to be somebody, a person, first that people remember, but also, I want music that I release to still be around. I don't want it to just be cool for a second and be gone.": "Cole",
  "Being a big Braves fan, Turner Field would be cool to play a show at.": "Cole",
  "Getting hit is not cool.": "Andre",
  "The problem to me is violence. It's not cool to kill somebody or hurt people.": "Mark",
  "It's cool when your husband starts to sing some old Merle Haggard song and I can pop in with a harmony and it doesn't sound too bad.": "Trisha",
  "I wanted to be Cher for a long time, but not for the singing. I just thought she was so cool. I wanted her long hair, and I wanted to weigh five pounds.": "Trisha",
  "What we do every night is we change out the set list as much as we can to make sure that (fans can) go home and tell their friends they experienced something unique and cool.": "Isaac",
  "It's all these young country bucks doing Skynyrd songs, which is pretty cool to us.": "Johnny",
  "Goteborg used to be a not very cool place to live. The culture centered around shrimp and bingo. Bands played Copenhagen and Stockholm and skipped Goteborg.": "Jens",
  "Can anything be less cool than defending the motion picture academy?": "Steve",
  "Redford always has been a cool presence both before and behind the camera. His best movie as a filmmaker, 1994's 'Quiz Show,' exhibits a classicism verging on self-repression, and the social indignation in many of his films engages more than moves you.": "Steve",
  "J. G. Ballard is just an example of the writers I like. Philip K. Dick is obviously one of them. I'm a big fan of William Gibson as well. He started cyberpunk with 'Neuromancer.' I've come to know him a little bit over Twitter, of all places, and I was always a huge fan of his. It's very cool to know he even knows I exist.": "Duncan",
  "My dad put me with all the greatest people. It definitely helped me now, because I know so much more about music and composition. It's cool. I love Pops. I'm super thankful for everything he's done to help my career.": "Ty",
  "When we dropped 'Toot It And Boot It,' Mustard didn't even do beats, and now he's killin' it. So it's just cool to see all of my bros taking over.": "Ty",
  "Metal has its own code of cool, but it's not really trying to be cool. And that was very refreshing to me, that metal is very much about expressing something that seems awesome to you even if, at the time, much of the world was going to mock and reject it.": "John",
  "You get this really cool groove when you're playing just piano, bass, and drums where everyone's sort of feeling each other's space, which is the only way to put it, but it really is true, and everyone's sort of sitting in their own pocket. It's kind of jazz-like.": "John",
  "I remember going with my mom to a random garage sale as a kid and thinking what a cool treasure hunt that whole world was. Only to transition as an adult to think, 'What a gross place that really is.'": "Will",
  "Check-ins are cool, but kind of a pain.": "Sam",
  "Many founders hire just because it seems like a cool thing to do, and people always ask how many employees you have.": "Sam",
  "In rock and roll, homosexuality was accepted, but it was less cool to say it.": "John",
  "Growing up, it was uncool to admit that your family had any money. And then, instantly, money was cool. In Reagan's parlance, it was about freedom of the individual, which was freedom to be greedy... individual versus society. There was a weird seduction in that, which I still feel.": "John",
  "It's cool when frat boys say, 'Yeah, 'Hedwig!' I'd like to see that same thing happen with 'Shortbus.'": "John",
  "My mom was a little weepy. My dad was very logical about it. Once they realized you can't change, they wanted to know that you can be happy and be gay. Once they realized that, they were very cool about it.": "John",
  "Public relations and marketing are something companies do to move product. It is not meaningful. It is not cool. Yet because it is cheap, easy, and lucrative to cover, blogs want to convince you that it is.": "Ryan",
  "Lupe Fiasco is kinda cool. I like him a lot.": "Yuna",
  "I've never done anything because I thought it would look cool.": "John",
  "You don't have to carry a designer bag that costs more than a car to look cool.": "Kesha",
  "There are lots of really interesting little planets out there in the Kuiper Belt, but Pluto's the only one that's got all the cool attributes.": "Alan",
  "I like the planets because they are real places that you can go to and send machines to. Faraway astronomy - galactic astronomy and extra-galactic astronomy - is really cool stuff, but to me, it's about destinations.": "Alan",
  "I just worry about myself. I'm just gonna be me and do me. If people appreciate it, cool. If not, I'm gonna still be me.": "Robbie",
  "I've always been into guitars... we want to put keyboards on, but keyboard players don't look cool onstage, they just keep their heads down. There has never been a cool keyboard player, apart from Elton John.": "Noel",
  "Every year, tens of millions of salmon return to the pristine shores of Bristol Bay in Alaska. They linger in the bay's cool, shallow waters before charging up nearby streams to spawn and create another generation of wild salmon.": "Frances",
  "The cool thing about my show and me is that I'm a writer, and I'm a writer first if I don't have music.": "Halsey",
  "You get a timeless cool card in New York.": "Vin",
  "I don't know who came up with this idea that it's cool to hate on other girls, 'cause it's not.": "Lilly",
  "I think the Mama people remember is from 'Mama's Family.' She really turned into a pretty cool character. The sketches from the 'Burnett' show, if people are old enough to remember, were written by writers who all hated their mothers.": "Vicki",
  "I love the Army-Navy surplus store Surplus Value Center. They have really good long underwear and multicolored bandanas, cool camo jackets, and really, really scary-looking knives. If you're into that sort of thing.": "Jill",
  "Morgan Freeman is so class. He's so cool. He's so scary.": "Jim",
  "I may just keep releasing singles 'til I run out of music, which is kind of cool in a way - as long as people don't go, 'Oh my God, not another one!'": "John",
  "Tobey's a mellow, cool guy. He's just a good guy. I know that's not the answer you want, and I don't mean that as the political thing to say, but he's a nice guy.": "Neil",
  "I don't think it's cool for people to say, 'You shouldn't reference God because I don't believe that, and I don't want to hear it.' Well, there's a lot of stuff I don't believe that I still gotta hear.": "Steve",
  "I follow all these fashion blogs that are cool and inspire me. I'm not really obsessed with anyone except for the people that I like romantically. I get excited when they post. Sometimes I like to stalk my exes.": "Kylie",
  "My mother was so stylish, but she never pushed that on me. She always thought I looked cool.": "Tig",
  "I went to Catholic high school for half a year and religion wasn't the cool thing to talk about even at a catholic high school. It never came up.": "Mandy",
  "I've always loved the mixture of crushing live drums with a programmed groove, that really cool blend, like in the verse there's a really funky drum beat that is programmed then it comes in to the chorus; you've got that enormous human feel where the band kicks in.": "Tommy",
  "Some girls are intimidated by my height, obviously. But a lot of girls do like it, so that's cool.": "Kristaps",
  "I tried to be a goth for a while. I'd pour baby powder on my face and paint my lips black, but that didn't last long. I thought I looked cool at the time. But then you look back and wonder, 'Why did anyone let me out of the house looking like that?'": "Imelda",
  "People don't know exactly what I do they just know I'm 'cool.' ": "Diplo",
  "Klaus from the Teddybears, Bloodshy and Avant and Mike Snow, they've done lots of Britney Spears production. They went backwards from production to being in a band, which might be cool. I might do that, too, one day.": "Diplo",
  "I appreciate people who are authentic. Someone who just wants to be cool, I can tell when their intentions aren't right.": "Diplo",
  "Selling MP3s or physical copies, it's still cool, but I think it's slowly becoming outdated to where people just want to build a culture.": "Diplo",
  "Gucci is a rapper that doesn't try and be anything he's not - he's straight up. Yeah, maybe it's ironic and all, but I'm just a fan and have been one since day one. Gucci Mane is the cool uncle I never had, even though I'm sure I'm probably older than him.": "Diplo",
  "There aren't many poster children for cool angst. Everybody thinks it's cool if you're the bad girl.": "Fiona",
  "I think you go through a period as a teenager of being quite cool and unaffected by things.": "Miranda",
  "I think sometimes I guess you see records, say you want to get there and use that as motivation. In a way, it's kind of cool if there is a possibility to rewrite history and be up there with the greats of Olympic history.": "Michael",
  "I've really enjoyed working together with Apple to help launch their new streaming service. It is really cool to see Apple getting involved.": "Kygo",
  "Personally, I was never the cool kid. I was always sort of a bookworm.": "Zac",
  "Spider-Man's probably my favorite. You see, Batman is a billionaire and there's nothing really cool about a billionaire saving the world. But Spider-Man is Peter Parker, a conflicted character who puts on a suit and saves the world. I love that.": "Zac",
  "I'd love to be an artist that's multifaceted. At the moment, I am not. But wouldn't that be cool if I was like, 'Yeah, let me pull out my guitar and play you a song.' I would adore that. I am so far not gifted in that way. But I am a very hard worker and a very determined person, so who knows?": "Anne",
  "I went to a high school that didn't have many people in it. There were, like, 60 people in my senior class. There was a group of cool kids and a group of really dorky kids, and I was probably the coolest of the really dorky kids.": "Matthew",
  "Every time I take a photo, it goes into SnapSeed. Even if it's just a price tag on something, it still goes into SnapSeed, and I start editing it. I'm not a photographer, so I need all the help I can get when it comes to make a picture look cool.": "Hunter",
  "Basically, after an ABC sitcom I did, I ended up with a holding deal with 20th Century Fox. Absolutely cool. It pays you to be unemployed. And the bigger the entity that gives you the deal, the better.": "Nathan",
  "Most of the time you're too busy to think about it. But every now and then you say, 'I work at 'Saturday Night Live,' and that is so cool.": "Tina",
  "When I was younger I did karate and martial arts, and I think it's really cool for girls to have those kinds of abilities.": "Rebel",
  "You can't be a strong or cool woman and be represented except in a harsh way, looking mean and cold and hard. It's like reverse sexism.": "Kim",
  "I live a very nice life. I have a wonderful time. But it's not lived drawing on a full level. I'm relaxed, cool, and enjoying it.": "Marianne",
  "I think it's most important to, rather than just do what everybody else is doing, like tons of selfies, find out what makes you excited. You know, is it taking pictures and doing cool makeup and making yourself look great? If so, wonderful. Is it music? Is it teaching something? Are you great at teaching?": "Lindsey",
  "I'm afraid one thing - I don't like heights. Heights bug me out. I'm not cool with heights. I refuse to do a comedy show 12 stories up. I'm fearless about everything else.": "J.",
  "In recording, you're trying to make something work sonically - getting the right inflection on the right guitar sound - and maybe a part that would be musically great doesn't sound as cool. On paper, though, it's all stripped back. The musical idea is the one that wins.": "Beck",
  "People see my photos and think I labor over my image and I'm this cool, brooding artist. But I'm just having fun with it.": "Lenny",
  "For the last few years, it's been so chic for everybody to be miserable. Like if you're in with the cool crowd, you can't be happy.": "Lenny",
  "What is more important than the name is that people know that I really like acting, I enjoy it and I want people to know that I am serious. The name thing: I will always be L.L. Cool J.": "LL",
  "I think there are different kinds of comedians, and I prefer the clowns who are going: 'I'm an idiot, aren't we all a bit like this, laugh at me.' Whereas, a lot of other comedians are saying: 'Aren't I clever? You want to be me, aren't I cool? Revere me.' Which is fine. But that's not my bag.": "Miranda",
  "Summer bachelors, like summer breezes, are never as cool as they pretend to be.": "Nora",
  "I know what it feels like to have the door slammed firmly in my face, so I'm cool with that.": "Mos",
  "You know, the diversity that America has is so special. It's starting to really become a cool thing for young people.": "Russell",
  "I'm cool with people dressing up as Eleven for Halloween. I definitely want to open my door and give them candy.": "Millie",
  "We didn't do a square ball in 'Pong' because we thought it was cool. We did it because that was all we could do.": "Nolan",
  "I was in choir in school. I kind of just did it. I already knew I wanted to sing. My music program in my school wasn't really great - people didn't really want to be part of the choir, they didn't want to do the plays and stuff like that. It definitely wasn't the cool thing to do.": "Lea",
  "I live in Brooklyn, in Williamsburg, so I just like to wander around. Williamsburg's such a cool little neighborhood community spot.": "Zoe",
  "It's a trend to insult Wale, like that makes you cool on the Internet, and a part of it is because I respond.": "Wale",
  "I think we all attract troublemakers; I don't think it's particularly about anyone. I had it actually as an album title, and I thought it would be really cool to write a song about a girl that's a bit of troublemaker.": "Olly",
  "Michael B. Jordan is actually cool. He's like the homie. I'm actually talking to him. He reached out to me a while ago and just showing love for the music after 'TRaPSOUL' dropped.": "Bryson",
  "I don't rely on catchphrases or really like sing-along. I just do whatever I feel. Whatever the beat makes me say, I do that and I run with that. It's been working for me, so I'd be cool with that.": "Meek",
  "Remember when Japan was cool? We used to run around with 'Mr. Roboto' on our Walkmans, 'The Karate Kid' in our Betamaxes and wore T-shirts embossed with the characters for 'storm sewer' and 'dishwasher.'": "Jen",
  "I wish I could say I am a rebel for love in real life. I don't think I am so cool.": "Tiger",
  "I love that my fans are cool with me being lovey-dovey about my wife rather than pretending that I'm single and trying to act all sexy onstage.": "Thomas",
  "Some years I'm the coolest thing that ever happened, and then the next year everyone's so over me, and I'm just so past my sell date.": "Cher",
  "Stop being conned by the old mantra that says, 'Leaders are cool, managers are dweebs.' Instead, follow the Peters Principle: Leaders are cool. Managers are cool too!": "Tom",
  "I think a lot of young kids at school are very conscious of trying to keep credibility in case they kind of stand out in a crowd and get bullied by trying to stay cool and stuff. And my whole thing, all the way through school, was I was just a goof... I didn't care.": "Dominic",
  "The term 'geek' for me is like you having a passion, interest in something that is unabashed and you don't care if people think it's not cool. You think it's cool and that's your thing.": "Dominic",
  "Traditional social media, in the view of our company, has become a bit repetitive. It doesn't feel very good to be marketed to by your friends. Snapchat is different because it says, look, friends aren't valuable to you just because they can get you into a cool party.": "Evan",
  "I started on computers with 'Billy Bathgate,' a little orange screen with black letters. I thought it was really cool, but it actually slowed me up for a while because it's so easy to revise, I tended to stay on the same page. I've learned to discipline myself.": "E.",
  "I never considered Miles Davis a perfectionist; I always considered him as an excellence-ist, where deviation is actually kind of cool.": "Charlie",
  "You watch stuff like 'The Real Housewives' and you start to think, 'We're all so vacuous! Is there any nobility to any of these people?' But then you look out into the world, and there are people who are doing cool stuff with their lives.": "Mike",
  "To me, a critic is some loser who has no idea... someone with an opinion. We all have opinions. No offense, but what makes them dictate what is cool and what is not.": "Vanilla",
  "Yeah, I get to fight in 'Eclipse.' My trainer is teaching me MMA right now. So. Cool.": "Ashley",
  "At first, when you go to premieres and award shows, you're thinking, 'How the hell am I here? All these people I've never met are here, and it's so cool!' And then, as time goes on, it's a little bit like, 'Ah... it's more like work.'": "Emma",
  "You can't go wrong with reading the fans and letting them tell you who they like. I think that's really paid off for me in the long run - being down to earth and just really cool with each and every fan that I meet - and they've really supported me through thick and thin.": "Jeff",
  "I'm excited to create more awareness about the importance of giving the youth of America a choice. There's a 24-hour music channel. There's a 24-hour comedy channel. I believe there's a 24-hour gay channel coming. Why isn't there a 24-hour Christian channel that's edgy and hip and cool and new and different, like all that other stuff?": "Stephen",
  "I just love the idea of ordinary people doing extraordinary things, whether it's the success of 'Cool Runnings,' which is the success of four guys from Jamaica who had never seen snow, or whether it's my success, just as a human being.": "Dawn",
  "All I know is that I've ruled out wearing fairy wings. When I was nine I wanted to get married in fairy wings, and now I realize that's not cool anymore.": "Isla",
  "I'm not geeky but I have my geeky, corky moments, and then I've got some aspects of cool in me, I guess.": "Nick",
  "That's the hardest thing about being a mom. You want to be cool, and you want them to like you all the time, but you can't always have that. You're gonna have times where you have to say no, and you won't be the most popular person in the house.": "Martina",
  "I was the kind of reader in smudged pink harlequin glasses sitting on the cool, dusty floor of the Arrandale public library, standing at the edge of the playground, having broken a tooth in dodge ball, and lying under my covers with a flashlight.": "Amy",
  "It is a weird feeling to have people go, 'Hey Chris' like they know me. But, number one, 99 percent of my experiences have been really cool. People couldn't be nicer and more positive.": "Christopher",
  "The truth is, we have this idea that late night is about creativity and being cool, but that's not our job. Our job is to get as many people watching the commercials in between our show. That's the reality of it.": "Jimmy",
  "Prominence is cool, but when the delusion kicks in it can be a drag. Especially if you choose to surround yourself with friends and not acolytes.": "Barbara",
  "It's cool to express myself, but I've had to learn that doing interviews isn't completely therapy - spilling everything about yourself isn't healthy all the time. But I've been through things that have made me a stronger person, and if I can help some people, I will.": "Fergie",
  "Sydney in the 1960s wasn't the exuberant multicultural metropolis it is today. Out in the city's western reaches, days passed in a sun-struck stupor. In the evenings, families gathered on their verandas waiting for the 'southerly buster' - the thunderstorm that would break the heat and leave the air cool enough to allow sleep.": "Geraldine",
  "I think it's cool to provoke something in people.": "Morgan",
  "There's a lot of thinking when you choreograph something. You're not just choreographing some bodies, arms, legs flying around to look cool. It's a lot more complicated and sophisticated. You also have to deal with the connection of the whole film, so when I choreograph, I think of the movement itself, the camera angles, the characters.": "Donnie",
  "Some people are cool with the fact that their bodies bear witness to this great thing they produced, their children, and I understand that. But on a personal level, it makes me feel better that my breasts are not down to my knees when I'm undressed in front of my husband.": "Patricia",
  "One of the key factors of life is love, and the key factor of God is love, so having that understanding is really important in a relationship. Having someone that genuinely respects you and understands your life and is open to hearing about your life is really cool.": "Sofia",
  "Right now there are a lot of Angels represented. We are from all over the world. We come from different backgrounds. We all had different lives before this, so it is really interesting how a lot of different nationalities are represented, and it is super cool.": "Elsa",
  "Oh my God, I sweat so much! You have to keep deodorant in your purse and use those deodorising wipes that cool you off a bit.": "Elsa",
  "You don't have to be a certain thing to be cool. If you're white, you don't have to act black or whatever. Just be you and know who you are.": "Wiz",
  "People connect with me just as a cool, around-the-way type of guy.": "Wiz",
  "I have met Jackie Chan about 6 times up 'til now... and even though many people think we are natural enemies, I personally think he is a cool bloke and would honestly love to work with him in a film one time - that would a well brilliant movie!": "Jet",
  "I'm a flamboyant type of guy, a cooler version of Liberace.": "Usher",
  "It seems like once people grow up, they have no idea what's cool.": "Bill",
  "It wasn't cool that I didn't comb my hair and had books and wore glasses. It was never cool be a nerd and tomboy, and these days, it really is. And I'm like, 'You guys have no idea what I went through.' How many times my mother yelled at me to comb my hair.": "AJ",
  "That's the best way to feed the human mind. That's how Bob Marley did it. He never put it in your face. After you got the groove, you were just singing the hooks, because you thought it was cool.": "Wyclef",
  "I liked the name Frog Brigade because it lent itself to a lot of cool imagery with the whole frog thing.": "Les",
  "I admire Kings of Leon. I think their records are amazing. Just from hanging out with them, I can say they're good guys. It's cool to see that they get to do what they love. But I think they clearly have an appreciation for where they came from, and it has shaped who they are.": "Nick",
  "For a few months when I was about 17, I smoked a small cigar because I thought it looked cool and it would get me the girls. It didn't.": "Jonathan",
  "I'm a fan of designers and clothes that look beautiful, but more importantly, make me feel beautiful and confident. It's why I've always loved Stella McCartney, and more recently, Prabal Gurung. Their pieces are cool, yet timeless, and the fits are effortlessly flattering.": "Shay",
  "I was a kid watching music videos, which were so cool and made me want to learn how to dance. I wish I could've gone to dance classes and learn, like, hip-hop dancing.": "Iggy",
  "I never think of myself as any kind of sex symbol, but I get letters from all over, all sorts. It's really cool. I get a lot from inmates, which is kind of scary. But the best was the guy who wanted to send me a plane ticket to fly me to his prom.": "Laura",
  "You have this ability in hip hop to be invincibly cool, and that is a part of G-Eazy.": "G-Eazy",
  "I have, I admit, a low tolerance for detached chronicling and cool analysis.": "Leslie",
  "It's really cool to see glowsticks at the show, to see dance music culture infiltrating and becoming one with the metal community.": "Jonathan",
  "I got to say 'Hi' to Dolly Parton, which my mom thought was kind of cool.": "Landon",
  "I grew up playing video games. And the cool thing about the EA Sports games is they took me through the whole motion-capture thing, where they put little sensors on my body so the video game really is me. It actually moves the way I move.": "Landon",
  "When you get to your mid-20s, you start to feel responsibilities for the things that you do and the people around you. It's a cool age.": "Eliza",
  "Manners are love in a cool climate.": "Quentin",
  "An intense temperament has convinced me to teach not only from books but from what I have learned from experience. So I try to impress upon young doctors and graduate students that tumultuousness, if coupled to discipline and a cool mind, is not such a bad sort of thing.": "Kay",
  "I think it's cool people love to hate me.": "Carice",
  "I think it's really cool, but Jimmy Eat World and Gin Blossoms did it better than anyone. People don't realize just how awesome the Arizona history is, especially for alternative music. Growing up, that's all I ever wanted to be was those two bands.": "Nate",
  "On the tennis court, one needs a cool temperament, tremendous ball sense, reflexes, speed, hand-eye co-ordination, power, timing and peak physical fitness. Off the court, the player and support team need skills in planning, execution, travel, an ability to raise funds when needed, and several other talents.": "Sania",
  "My parents are very cool and wildly supportive - maybe almost too much. I want to tell them to chill out.": "Adam",
  "In Hollywood today, it's cool for guys to wear nail polish and earrings in their lips and tongues. I don't get it.": "Scott",
  "After a Saturday game, we're in on a Sunday to cool down and make sure we're fully back at it again. But it doesn't really affect things too much. It's basically like you've had a game on the Saturday, and then you're in the cup on a Tuesday.": "Jamie",
  "Being in America isn't old-hat - it's where we're from - but I get excited to be in other parts of the world like Athens and Croatia, which were quite cool. I'm a sightseer. I go see the sights and museums. I'm into that kind of thing.": "Richie",
  "I've always been a fan of football, always watched the NFL and it's great to always sit back wherever I can this year. You sit back and enjoy the games, pop a little sports drink - not any pop or soda - lay back, watch the games. It's always cool to see how the games go down and just enjoy them.": "Rob",
  "He who keeps his cool best wins.": "Norman",
  "It looks good when you see someone kicking at the age of 51 with no double. It's kinda cool for people to know that past 50 we can keep flexible.": "Jean-Claude",
  "When I decided to launch my first knitwear line, it was because I saw a void in the basics category. The editors were always looking for cool, fashion-forward tees and sweaters. So that's where I started.": "Alexander",
  "We had incense and rock'n'roll posters, and we sold records and rolling papers. People could just, like, hang out. We had a cool vibe going.": "Tommy",
  "I wanted to get out of Ashland, and I thought it would be pretty cool to go to school in the East. So I asked my guidance counselor what Ivy League schools were. And I applied to Harvard, Yale and Dartmouth - that was it. My guidance counselor told me I wouldn't get into an Ivy League school. So as my act of resistance, that's all I applied to.": "Winona",
  "The possibilities are endless now, with performing, getting your music online, getting your own website and getting your music out there. I think that's very cool and amazing.": "Dave",
  "'Ludacris' is something that I made up. It just kind of describes me. Sometimes I have like a split personality. Sometimes I'm cool, calm, and collected, and other times I'm beyond crazy.": "Ludacris",
  "It's always cool to meet people who can do things that you have no capacity to do.": "Kevin",
  "I do, I kick major butt in 'Dredd.' I get to kill people. I break a guy's neck by roundhouse kicking him in the face. It was me, I did it. I learned how to roundhouse kick. I also do it with my hands cuffed behind my back so it's pretty cool I have to say. Yeah, leather body suit, blonde hair, the whole thing.": "Olivia",
  "Every collection that I work on, I always think, Is this cool enough to wear to a concert?": "Anna",
  "When I started playing music, I was more of a character. Now I'm just me with a cool outfit on. I'm more comfortable being myself.": "Ben",
  "My natural gravitation is toward the gray and the black and the white and the burgundy. Sort of muted, cool colors.": "Jessica",
  "Being exhausted is all part of the fun. I'm cool with it. I'm not going to wish that it would slow down.": "James",
  "It's pretty cool to see yourself on a video game.": "Rickie",
  "I suppose there must be idiots who dream of signing deals with publishers while fully intending to drink martinis in cool bars or ride around on skateboards. But the actual writers I know are experts in neurotic self-torture. Every page of writing is the result of a thousand tiny decisions and desperate acts of will.": "Helen",
  "My parents used to throw great New Year's Eve parties. They invited such an eclectic mix of showbiz people. All those cool people were always hanging out at our apartment.": "Ben",
  "I don't like reading things that people say on the Internet because I know so much of it is not true. I don't want to waste my time worrying about what other people are thinking. I just want to focus on being able to do cool projects.": "Lily",
  "I am the woman with the cool vintage glasses... I am the proud wife beside her husband... I am the writer who has written a new novel.": "Ann",
  "I was in art school, and we had all these random classes. We'd listen to a lot of Bollywood. I'd listen to Spanish music - and I don't even speak Spanish, but Hector Lavoe is amazing - we listened to French music like Edith Piaf. She's tight. I like cool vocal inflections; I like cool sounds. I pretty much listen to anything I think is good.": "Kehlani",
  "I have a huge ego - I know that. Do I worry about it? No, I think it's cool. I have a lot of fun.": "Kim",
  "I get 100 e-mails a day from Americans who say, 'What you're doing is cool - can we work for you?' From Germans, I also get 100 e-mails a day, saying, 'You fat pig!' or 'You're a liar and a criminal!' I'm trying to change this.": "Kim",
  "In the summer I wear shorts with a bright top and ankle boots or just sandals. I'll add a nice scarf, maybe a hat, some cool sunglasses. It's all about the accessories.": "Alessandra",
  "They're a different generation, those kids; kids that are under the age of twelve. They're not that impressed by rock music, you know what I mean? They're like, it's cool and everything, but whatever. They're just as impressed by YouTube.": "Frank",
  "Country's hip it's cool music. ": "Ricky",
  "For me, 'Sam & Cat' is cool because it's got this buddy-comedy aspect that 'iCarly' or 'Victorious' didn't have.": "Jennette",
  "Consumers used to think they had to compromise with solar. It was, 'Okay, I'm doing the right thing for the environment; it's cool to see the panels. I have to compromise on the cost and convenience side.' And now they no longer have to. On the cost side, it's cheaper, and on the convenience side, we set it all up.": "Lynn",
  "Ron Howard is as good a person as you could want to work with on film. He never lost his cool. He's the most easygoing, lovely man, but he's got this enormous intelligence and a wonderful humanity.": "Christine",
  "I make no secret of the fact that writing She-Hulk can serve as an opportunity for me to sneak in some really cool characters that I personally love. Some will be obvious fits, but others will come out of left field - but that's what's fun about the Marvel U - the bench is deep.": "Charles",
  "It's funny because the action figures are cool, and then I enjoy the magazines because that's me. Obviously, the fans are wonderful - they're so excited - but I'm not Rey, and people tend to not be able to differentiate the two.": "Daisy",
  "I don't need to hang out in a posse and try to act cool.": "Jeremy",
  "Apparently it's cool to watch The Daily Show.": "Rob",
  "I think I'm so old I'm in. We call it the 'Tony Bennett Syndrome.' For some reason, young people think I'm cool.": "Bill",
  "I want to create a lifestyle niche for that cool girl who's really into fashion but not too obsessed with it.": "Erin",
  "I think that for me, growing up, my dad was in the Navy; we went all over the world. I love things the weirder the better. The idea I could eat things like snails or frogs legs or things like that was mind-blowingly cool.": "Graham",
  "I saw a drummer play once when I was a kid and I thought, that's really cool. You know, you're moving. You're using your arms and fingers. So I tried it and I loved it.": "Bill",
  "Hip-hop is still cool at a party. But to me, hip-hop has never been strictly a party; it is also there to elevate consciousness.": "Saul",
  "Cricket makes no sense to me. I find it beautiful to watch and I like that they break for tea. That is very cool, but I don't understand. My friends from The Clash tried to explain it years and years ago, but I didn't understand what they were talking about.": "Jim",
  "When you're 14, anything with a sword and a dragon is pretty cool. But when you're 21 and you've read 2,000 fantasy novels, you start to realize that some of those books, well, they weren't really good. OK, let's be honest. A lot of them were crap.": "Patrick",
  "I never set out to become 'famous.' I mean, when you're 14 you think 'I'm gonna become a writer and people will want my autograph and that'll be cool,' but you grow up and you learn that's just not how the world works. I resigned myself to the fact that I would probably never be published and if I did it probably wouldn't be a big deal.": "Patrick",
  "I've always been a geek and slightly awkward... slightly umm... I was never the cool kid at school.": "David",

  "The cool thing about writing music, writing anything, is that once you publish it, it's there forever.": "Ryan",
  "The plus size movement is not just about fashion; it's about body image, and if we're doing a shoot, they won't retouch us at all. That's the cool thing: there's no retouching at all because we want to give girls the truth, not a fabrication.": "Hayley",
  "What I kind of want to spread as my message to all kinds of youth that I get to reach out to is, you can do cool stuff; you've just got to put in time and be dedicated.": "Ann",
  "He's as cool as a prized marrow!": "Sid",
  "You cannot represent cool. You've got to be cool. You've got to be authentic. I think, after all these years, that is how I define cool. It is being authentic. That is powerful.": "Henry",
  "I've danced my whole life. Martial arts is just fun for me, it's all choreographed a bit like dance. I have done Muay Thai and Wushu, which is cool because it's very fluid dance. I also do Tricking. It's kind of like Taekwondo with the big kicks and flips and showier aspects of martial arts.": "Caity",
  "And in a world without heroes, as the movie trailer voice-over guy might say, the slightly awkward can be slightly cool.": "Adam",

  "As a culture or a civilisation, we are a bit juvenile; it's like 'Oh, I have all this power, whoa, this is so cool, I can transform the earth and I can produce all this wealth. But we're blinded by our success in a naive way. There's more to life, actually, and I think the sustainability issue is also helpful in reminding us about that.": "Tino",
  "It feels very cool to be part of a girl gang.": "Aidy",
  "You can't plan success with a creative field. So I enjoy it while it's here, and I know it won't be forever. Maybe one day I'll have to go back to flipping burgers, but for now I'm going to enjoy the cool things.": "George",
  "I read the Koran and it appealed to me. At the time I was agnostic and it really breathed spiritually back into me. For me it's really a cushion; it's cool, I'm cool with it.": "Q-Tip",
  "I got tired of the Ramones around the time I quit and I really got into rap. I thought it was the new punk rock. LL Cool J was my biggest idol.": "Dee",

  "I think you create your own hipness.": "Peabo",
  "I always thought I'd look corny in the type of rap video in the club with girls and all that type of stuff. I just didn't think I could really pull that off. We always think it's more fun and better just to go outside the box and to use our videos to show cool concepts.": "Mac",
  "A lot of people are obsessed with looking cool. They feel they have to look after their image.": "Adrian",
  "The people who write official histories for the Army believe that a generation needs to pass before you can tackle the official history. It's useful to have some distance.

  "I started writing stories in sixth grade. But writing wasn't cool, like being good at sports, or being part of the in crowd, or winning fights on the playground.": "Rodman",
  "Opening day is always so cool to be a part of and to people watch. The Pacific Classic, which I've had the privilege of riding in a couple of times, is great. Every day at Del Mar is fantastic.

  "You can be cool and at the same time respect your woman, who will hopefully become your wife, who will hopefully become the mother of your kids. America needs to get back to family values.": "Martin",
  "Coming up, the music of my era was very conscious. I grew up on Public Enemy, and it was popular culture to be aware. People were wearing Malcolm X T-shirts and Malcolm X hats. It was a very cool thing to know who Malcolm X was. It was all in the lyrics. It was trendy to be conscious and aware.": "D'Angelo",
  "I'm in this really cool place in my career, where the stage I'm on that night, whether it's the Paisley tour, the CMT tour, or a bar with 10 people in it, it is the most important show I've ever played in my life. I go to the ends of my imagination to do something that's unforgettable every night.": "Charlie",

  "If we have a purpose in life beyond being a cog in the human machine, mine is to help inspire people and that's pretty cool. I would like to motivate the world.": "Steve",

  "Being an author of banned books is cool, I've decided.": "Lauren",
  "The Cool Kids are Chicago. Me being from Michigan is a part of that dynamic.": "Chuck",

  "In college - while figuring the things out that most people do in college - I had no game. No confidence. I had Birkenstocks. And overalls. A budding romance novel addiction. But no cool. No poise. I was trying on a thousand different personalities, but a lot of them were formed by the perceptions of others.": "Molly",
  "It doesn't sound that cool to say it, but I still get nervous for any show. But it's different degrees - playing a small basement of a club versus playing a festival like Firefly or Bonnaroo. The feeling is, 'Crap, I'm about to be blasted in the face,' and once you get started, then it's like, 'OK, I've done this before. I know what I'm doing.'": "Josh",
  "A huge thing for me growing up was going to see my favorite bands and feeling like, 'Okay, cool, they proved themselves and did things in a special way.' That's the most important thing.": "Kellin",
  "It was really cool to work with Dakota Fanning. I've watched her grow up and I've always loved her films, loved her.

  "I am always looking for a cool tee shirt maybe one with a rock band or an old advertisement. ": "Bridget",
  "White people couldn't do black music back in the day because they weren't funky or bad enough. They weren't from the ghettoes, but hip-hop and R&B changed all of that because white kids want to be down with it. They wanted to learn it so they studied the culture. It's kind of a cool thing because we shouldn't be so separate.": "Narada",
  "The 'Being Human' people were really cool and let me improvise. They had such a good working atmosphere. It was a cool set-up and a really good environment to be in.": "Craig",

  "It's cool to have a well run, comfortable and inviting home.": "Anthea",
  "When I buy clothes, I like to buy them in outfits so I know they go together. I like a very simple, natural style. I never like to be the attention getter; I like to come under the radar and be cool about my look, very classic and stylish. I'm not into fads.": "Rena",

  "When I was in high school, my friends and I would drive out into the country to abandoned houses and structures... haha... to ghost hunt. We would scare each other so bad! We would sometimes camp out by the abandoned buildings just to scare ourselves! Such good times. The adrenaline of real fear is so cool!": "Keegan",

  "The cool thing about Kyle Killen, he writes really defined characters. I was a big fan of 'Awake' and also 'Lone Star.' I just think that he's a really, really special writer, and complex and deep, and a really smart dude.": "Jaime",
  "My first project was to build an ionization gauge control circuit for Professor Edgar Everhart's Cockcroft-Walton accelerator.

  "There's nothing less funny than someone who looks cool. There's nothing more unappealing.": "Eric",

  "'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' is just one of those movies that's like a page of history. You can't really go wrong. It's a prequel. It's not like number three. Which is really cool, to be the before as opposed to the after.": "Diora",
  "There was a period in my life when I would say no, and I didn't know why I was saying no. In most cases, it was out of fear, just trying to be safe. Because 'no' will keep you safe. 'No' won't draw attention to you. But all the cool things are on the other side of 'Yes, And.'": "Ali",
  "Now that we are cool, he said, and regret that we hurt each other, I am not sorry that it happened.": "William",
  "I like the way Quentin Tarantino creates a scene using a series of close-ups or showing very cool images of a person or people walking on some ordinary street in slow motion. I wish I could achieve that kind of slow-motion effect in manga, but it's rather difficult to draw; the only things we can play with are tones of black and white.": "Masashi",

  "Communication - the human connection - is the key to personal and career success.": "Paul",
  "In my deepest, darkest moments, what really got me through was a prayer. Sometimes my prayer was 'Help me.' Sometimes a prayer was 'Thank you.'

  "I think for any relationship to be successful, there needs to be loving communication, appreciation, and understanding.": "Miranda",
  "It's about communication. It's about honesty. It's about treating people in the organization as deserving to know the facts. You don't try to give them half the story.

  "I think honest communication, no matter where it comes from, is positive for a relationship.": "Ron",
  "Technology is at the forefront of everything these days - communication, work. It's amazing and scary at the same time how robots have evolved, but I find it hard to believe that robots will completely rule the world. Not in my lifetime anyway.": "Graham",
  "In the graver and more sentimental communication of man and man, the head still bears the superior sway; in the unreserved intimacies of man and woman, the heart is ever uppermost. Feeling is the main thing, and judgment passes for little.": "William",
  "Trade is a communication of cultures and values.": "Jack",
  "I think humans are just hard-wired to process people's faces and understand meaning and expression at such a more granular level than other types of communication.": "Mark",
  "People often cover their mouths when lying. A hand on the mouth or even a touch of the lips shows you that they are lying because this unconscious body language represents a closing off of communication.": "Travis",
  "Starting a new business will take its toll on your time and energy, and this can place strain on family and social relationships, depending on their expectations and how open you are in your communication with them.": "Fabrizio",

  "I'm interested in the theater because I'm interested in communication with audiences. Otherwise I would be in concert music.": "Stephen",
  "Seeing other people is incredibly engaging, and that's one of the drivers that made us partner with Facebook - social communication. Not social newsfeeds, but actual face-to-face, seeing multiple avatars in a play experience, that's going to be a very big part of the future in VR.": "Brendan",
  "I do a little fact checking now and then. Other than that its impact is simply that email has revolutionized communication for me, and my website has built up a community of readers, which is a lot of fun.": "Lee",

  "If the real radical finds that having long hair sets up psychological barriers to communication and organization, he cuts his hair. If I were organizing in an orthodox Jewish community, I would not walk in there eating a ham sandwich unless I wanted to be rejected so I could have an excuse to cop out.": "Saul",
  "If you're a politician, you might want to learn the Buddhist way of negotiation. Restoring communication and bringing back reconciliation is clear and concrete in Buddhism.": "Thich",

  "As a company grows, communication becomes its biggest challenge.": "Ben",
  "I think a guitar solo is how my emotion is most freely released, because verbal articulation isn't my strongest communication strength. My wife thinks that I should do interviews by listening to the questions and playing the answer on guitar.": "David",
  "In the past, before phones and the Internet, all communication was face-to-face. Now, most of it is digital, via emails and messaging services. If people were to start using virtual reality, it would almost come full circle.": "Palmer",

  "I can't be a hypocrite as a coach because as a player that's what I wanted. I wanted feedback, I wanted communication from the boss. I showed up for work, you can yell at me if you want, but I want input. So that's the kind of coach I want to be.": "Adam",
  "Who would know but ten years ago that kids would be texting each other all the time, that that would be one of their main forms of communication.

  "Be still when you have nothing to say; when genuine passion moves you, say what you've got to say, and say it hot.": "D.",
  "Any film that exists that is thorough, you can't give it to an audience of one and have that be effective communication. Communication involves an audience of many that have a conversation, put it through the ringer, filter it and then a sense of it coalesces.": "Shane",
  "With Jackson there was quiet solitude. Just to sit and look at the landscape. An inner quietness. After dinner, to sit on the back porch and look at the light. No need for talking. For any kind of communication.": "Lee",
  "I won't compare ants and people, but ants give us a useful model of how single members of a community can become so organized that they end up resembling, in effect, one big collective brain. Our own exploding population and communication technology are leading us that way.": "Lewis",

  "Corporate communications will become a high-tech art, just as political communication is for Obama.": "Tina",
  "If you're looking for ways of getting quick communication, maybe texting is the way to go. People can't walk these days without having one hand balancing a smart phone. If that's the way people are going to live, it is the case that something that vibrates in their hand is going to get their attention more quickly than an email.": "Ray",
  "The use of encrypted communication and data storage to shield terrorist coordination from intelligence and law-enforcement authorities is known as 'going dark.'": "Tom",
  "I don't want costumes and makeup between me and the audience - I want more direct communication. There's something for me about being honest on stage, and I'm at my most honest when I'm behind a piano. So I prefer my concert performances.": "Jason",
  "Having to go through an intervention and family counseling is a wonderful experience. I would almost recommend it to anybody. It opens a lot of communication, and it opens old sores, but once it is opened and hashed out, the rewards are far greater.": "Susan",

  "The speed of communication, the speed of information transfer, the cheapness of communication, the ease of moving things around the world are a difference in kind as well as degree.": "Paul",
  "This communication alone, by the comparison of the antagonisms, rivalries, movements which give birth to decisive moments, permits the evolution of the soul, whereby a man realizes himself on earth. It is impossible to be concerned with anything else in art.": "Robert",
  "As everyone in Louisiana knows, there was often no communication or coordination between the state and federal government in the aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.": "Bobby",

  "I find that communication as an actor and person is an important part of who I am. And I'm really drawn into the psychology of those dynamics.": "Zachary",
  "The major advances in speed of communication and ability to interact took place more than a century ago. The shift from sailing ships to telegraph was far more radical than that from telephone to email!": "Noam",
  "The first reason for the preponderant influence of those Evangelicals who define themselves as advocates of Religious Right theological and political ideologies is that they have both the financial means and technological know-how to make widespread use of modern electronic forms of communication.": "Tony",
  "My two daughters live on Facebook, and social media is their mode of communication.": "Tony",
  "No one who set out to design a form of communication would ever end up with anything like English, Mandarin, or any of the more than six thousand languages spoken today.": "Joshua",
  "Even in developing markets, we're seeing the growth of digital communication is proceeding at a very rapid pace.": "Irene",
  "The important thing to remember with the Internet is that there are large companies that have an interest in controlling how information flows in it. They're very effective at lobbying Congress, and that pattern has locked down other communication media in the past. And it will happen again unless we do something about it.": "Eli",
  "A common language is a first step towards communication across cultural boundaries.": "Ethan",
  "The idea that the Internet favors the oppressed rather than the oppressor is marred by what I call cyber-utopianism: a naive belief in the emancipatory nature of online communication that rests on a stubborn refusal to admit its downside.": "Evgeny",
  "However revolutionary it may be, the Internet still hasn't altered the basic law of human communication: Being nice to your interlocutors is a good way to start any negotiations, particularly, when being hostile is an open invitation for a cyber-fight.": "Evgeny",
  "Very often, organizations are inflexible because there is too little communication between functions; they are too segregated.": "Ken",
  "I don't like talking unnecessarily, and my communication skills are zilch. I just can't converse with people. Maybe it's because of my stuttering or stammering, but I'm not confident of talking with people. I only talk to very close friends and family.": "Pritam",

  "I understood that synergistic dance between photographer and object - 'muse,' if you will, 'model,' whatever you call us. It's that silent language of communication, like being psychic with each other.": "Carmen",
  "Very few people use landline phones for much of anything. So when you talk about things like online chat and social media messages and emails, what you're really talking about is the full extent of human communication.": "Glenn",
  "Religion unites man with God, or forms a communication between them; yet do they not say, 'God is infinite?' If God be infinite, no finite being can have communication or relation with him.": "Baron",
  "The key to high-quality communication is trust, and it's hard to trust somebody that you don't know.": "Ben",
  "I think the written word is probably the best medium of communication because you have time to reflect, you have time to choose your words, to get your sentences exactly right. Whereas when you're being interviewed, say, you have to talk on the fly, you have to improvise, you can change sentences around, and they're not exactly right.": "Richard",
  "In high school, sometimes you just can't help who you have a crush on and who you fall for! If you fall for one of your friend's exes, for example, it's really all about communication and telling your friend. Hiding it is never a good thing.": "Jillian",
  "I think there's a fear of disconnect sometimes; communication is a huge issue for all of us, from adults to kids, as far as our face-to-face time and our ability to interact with each other without isolating itself to a phone. I think that has to be something that's very challenging.": "Jim",
  "If we do away with semi-colons, parentheses and much else, we will lose all music, nuance and subtlety in communication - and end up shouting at one another in block capitals.": "Pico",
  "The way communication works is changing.": "Hubert",
  "Copywriting cuts the communication cord between word and feeling. By offering instant gratification, it atrophies more subtle emotions.": "Clive",
  "A great deal has been learned about cell communication. The universal nature of cellular structure and organization in bacteria, plant and animal cells has been discovered.": "Gunter",
  "Throughout my scientific career, my wife has been my most constant collaborator. Her experimental skill made major contributions to the work; she has eased for me beyond measure the difficulties of communication that accompany deafness; her encouragement and fortitude have been my strongest supports.": "John",
  "There are lots of reasons email persists, even as faster and simpler forms of communication proliferate and your personal communications likely have mostly migrated elsewhere. But one big one is that new types of media channels rarely totally kill off old ones, even though everyone predicts they will.": "Walt",
  "One of the most extraordinary and all-encompassing forms of communication is music. It reaches places that all kinds of other things cannot reach. I'll put my cards on the table: I think it is our greatest language.": "Simon",
  "Investing in management means building communication systems, business processes, feedback, and routines that let you scale the business and team as efficiently as possible.": "Fred",
  "You're talking about a younger generation, Generation Y, whose interpersonal communication skills are different from Generation X. The younger generation is more comfortable saying something through a digital mechanism than even face to face.": "Erik",
  "The world is a complex place, and the influence of the media in its representation and its power of communication and interpretation is a remarkable amplifier of emotions, and of illusions.": "Tariq",
  "It's populated by people who, by and large, have terrific communication skills. Every day is an extraordinary day. For me, it was just a great area for storytelling.": "Aaron",

  "I thought my life was mapped out. Research, living in the forest, teaching and writing. But in '86 I went to a conference and realised the chimpanzees were disappearing. I had worldwide recognition and a gift of communication. I had to use them.": "Jane",
  "It's so important for those living with chronic pain to establish good communication with both their healthcare professionals and caregivers. Clear communication about pain is vital to receiving proper diagnosis and effective treatment.": "Naomi",

  "A drawing is essentially a private work, related only to the artist's own needs; a 'finished' statue or canvas is essentially a public, presented work - related far more directly to the demands of communication.": "John",
  "My hectic work schedule does not often permit me time to visit temples, but my conversations with God don't depend on idol worship. Inside my heart, I have developed and sustained a direct communication with Him.": "Emraan",
  "There are many reasons our prayers may lack power. Sometimes they become routine. Our prayers become hollow when we say similar words in similar ways over and over so often that the words become more of a recitation than a communication.": "Joseph",
  "If there's one organization in the United States that could work on its communication skills, it's the military.": "Adam",
  "What we are going to offer is not a one-way communication, but one-to-one communication.": "Douglas",
  "Propaganda requires a permanent network of communication so that it can systematically stifle reflection with emotive or utopian slogans. Its pace is usually fast.": "John",
  "Everything good and bad about technology would be magnified by implanting it deep in brains. Is the risk of brain-hacking outweighed by the societal benefits of faster, deeper communication, and the ability to augment our own intelligence?": "Ramez",
  "It still amazes me how many musicians aren't really interested in engaging with their audience at all. Alfred Brendel, a pianist for whom I have the greatest respect, has described performance as a sacred communion between the artist and the composer. But what about the audience? Music is communication, a two-way street.": "Charles",
  "There are two barriers that often prevent communication between the young and their elders. The first is middle-aged forgetfulness of the fact that they themselves are no longer young. The second is youthful ignorance of the fact that the middle aged are still alive.": "Jessamyn",
  "The way you build trust with your team is around super-clear communication in that instant when they say, 'I will be sad if you don't do X.' You have to say, 'We're not going to do X, and here's why, and believe me, you'll be much sadder later if I let you go do it and you spend a bunch of time on it and nothing ever happens.'": "Dick",
  "Your insurance broker has your telephone number, but your insurance broker doesn't have your Facebook ID. I think they are very different modes of communication. Commingling them can come with risk and peril.": "Brian",
  "Civilization grew in the beginning from the minute that we had communication - particularly communication by sea that enabled people to get inspiration and ideas from each other and to exchange basic raw materials.": "Thor",
  "You don't have any communication between the Israelis and the Iranians. You have all sorts of local triggers for conflict. Having countries act on a hair trigger - where they can't afford to be second to strike - the potential for a miscalculation or a nuclear war through inadvertence is simply too high.": "Dennis",
  "The communication is in the work and words are no substitute for this.": "Mary",

  "Syllables govern the world.": "George",
  "We are a unique ape. We have language. Other animals have systems of communication that fall far short of that. They don't have the same ability to communicate complicated conditionals and what-ifs and talk about things that are not present.": "Richard",
  "Perhaps because my relationship with my father went through such a long, bumpy time, it's been very important for me to work to try to keep lines of communication open between my sons and myself to try to avoid my father's mistakes. At least if you're making mistakes, make different mistakes.": "Salman",

  "The new artists coming through were very materialistic and Hollywood, not so engaged in communication.": "Patti",
  "When I'm putting some communication out on Twitter or Facebook or Instagram, I think that it's helping me, my brain, you know, because it's always somehow stimulated by people who are sending things to me. And it works both ways. It's great. My brain is very happy about it.": "Yoko",
  "Clear communication is always important in central banking, but it can be especially important when economic conditions call for further policy stimulus but the policy rate is already at its effective lower bound.": "Ben",
  "My stay-married secret would probably be exercising good communication, not when you have to but all the time. I think if you do that, you kinda just cleanse the situations, so there's not build up. I think that's probably the best way to do it.": "Guy",
  "Oaths are but words, and words are but wind.": "Samuel",
  "I understand why people went nuts for 'The Artist.' We use words so much, it's nice to be able to explore a different way of communication, to be able to express silently what someone - or something - is thinking or feeling.": "Andy",

  "Be not a slave of words.": "Thomas",
  "One thing I've learned to appreciate as I've gotten a little older is direct forms of communication.": "Billy",
  "It's a fact that more people watch television and get their information that way than read books. I find new technology and new ways of communication very exciting and would like to do more in this field.": "Stephen",
  "Communications technology changes possibilities for communication, but that doesn't mean it changes the inherited structure of the brain. So you may think that you're addicted to online reading, but as soon as it isn't available anymore, your brain will pretty immediately adjust to other forms of reading. It's a habit like all habits.": "Margaret",
  "The idea of an animated film is you always kind of get a little bit daunted by it as a filmmaker because it feels like a lot of your communication is going to be with computer artists, and you're going to have to kind of channel the movie through extra pairs of hands.": "Peter",
  "A lasting relationship isn't about marriage. It's about compatibility and communication. And you both need to want it to work.": "Goldie",
  "It's all about communication and a dialogue between individuals - get rid of the labels, get rid of the shame, get rid of the stigmas and just be your most authentic self.": "Matt",

  "Man takes root at his feet, and at best, he is no more than a potted plant in his house or carriage till he has established communication with the soil by the loving and magnetic touch of his soles to it.": "John",
  "Corporate America is drowning in meetings. To make one thing clear, I am not against communication. Quick one-on-ones can be extremely effective. I am talking about those hour-long recurring meetings, devoid of a clear agenda, and attended by many. I dread them.": "Sebastian",
  "The Global Financial Crisis and Great Recession posed daunting new challenges for central banks around the world and spurred innovations in the design, implementation, and communication of monetary policy.": "Janet",

  "Art is essentially communication. It doesn't exist in a vacuum. That's why people make art, so other people can relate to it.": "Conor",
  "Ever since Newton, we've done science by taking things apart to see how they work. What the computer enables us to do is to put things together to see how they work: we're now synthesized rather than analysed. I find one of the most enthralling aspects of computers is limitless communication.": "Douglas",
  "Without question, we need to be informed of the happenings in the world. But modern communication brings into our homes a drowning cascade of the violence and misery of the worldwide human race. There comes a time when we need to find some peaceful spiritual renewal.": "James",
  "What I think works for Fox News is we have a very direct form of communication.": "Roger",
  "Communication is so key.": "Ashley",

  "We try to keep a good line of communication open with our children. It's not always about trying to just teach them every moment, but it's about listening to them and trying to understand them and gain that sense of communication so when they need to talk to someone, they know that we're there.": "Victoria",
  "Books are such a great way to spend time with your children, open lines of communication with your children, and just build that strong foundation.": "Victoria",
  "It is my desire to break the destructive generational cycle of illiteracy in the home by focusing on the children. Reading to your child has so much value as a parent because it opens the lines of communication.": "Victoria",
  "I grew up in an atmosphere where words were an integral part of culture.": "Wole",
  "But theater, because of its nature, both text, images, multimedia effects, has a wider base of communication with an audience. That's why I call it the most social of the various art forms.": "Wole",
  "And once you get instantaneous communication with everybody, you have economic activity that's far more advanced, far more liquid, far more distributed than ever before.": "Marc",
  "If you don't know each other you spend time doing research together, having dinner, and talking about your lives. You try to find common ground. Once you're shooting, the pressures are so intense; you really want to have a channel of communication open to you already.": "Edward",
  "The Pavlovian view of women voters - 'plug the words in, and they will respond' - sends a chill down my spine because it sounds like an adaptation of something I have written about communication between the sexes: When a woman tells a man about a problem, she doesn't want him to fix it; she just wants him to listen and let her know he understands.": "Deborah",
  "I've heard stories of people, even celebrities that have gone online, pretended to be someone they weren't, and conducted a 5-year friendship via e-mail. Then, they got married because they really love each other from all that communication.": "Diane",
  "Before language, cavemen simply grunted, and then they used the club. Communication changed that. It's the mechanism that created civilization and prevents its own destruction.": "Greg",
  "I think our biggest problem is lack of real, honest communication between black men and black women. A lot of men talk amongst men, and a lot of women speak amongst women.": "Hill",
  "'The Conversation' will hopefully touch on issues that will move people to want to strengthen communication and look to each other for solutions.": "Hill",
  "If we ever established contact with intelligent life on another world, there would be barriers to communication. First, they would be many light years away, so signals would take many years to reach them: there would be no scope for quick repartee. There might be an IQ gap.": "Martin",
  "I don't know any member of Congress who ever said, 'I'm satisfied with the communication that we have from the White House.'": "Nancy",
  "Maintaining a positive working relationship with Mexico's leadership will also be crucial to increasing communication and trade. I plan to personally maintain those relationships.": "Doug",
  "It's a difficult undertaking. I've been married for four years and I see this movie as a cautionary tale about people who've gone deeply out of communication.": "Mark",
  "For me, becoming a man had a lot to do with learning communication, and I learned about that by acting.": "Adam",
  "Throughout the European Middle Ages and Renaissance, Latin was the language of learning and international communication. But in the early modern period, it was gradually displaced by French. By the eighteenth century, all the world - or at least all of Europe - aspired to be Parisian.": "Michael",
  "Communication services need interoperability to succeed - and Loopt is the first such service since SMS that is available across all major U.S. wireless carriers.": "Sam",
  "The great work must inevitably be obscure, except to the very few, to those who like the author himself are initiated into the mysteries. Communication then is secondary: it is perpetuation which is important. For this only one good reader is necessary.": "Henry",
  "People just want to dig; they want to dance. They don't want to work all through the night, and neither do I. I like getting 'out there,' but communication should be occurring on more levels than heavy-laden philosophical.": "Kurt",
  "The late 20th century had just enough communication abilities to allow superstar-ness and communality to happen. It was a musical renaissance that rivals the visual one that happened in the 1400s.": "Daryl",
  "In many companies, the person who talks the best usually gets the job. I got snowed by a few of those people over the years. I still think communication is important, but I don't think there's always a correlation between being a great communicator and other virtues that make for a great leader.": "John",
  "CBS's Major Garrett writes in 'National Journal' about a new version of the 'stray voltage' theory of communication in which the president purposefully overstates his case knowing that it will create controversy.": "John",
  "I am worried about development in the field of information technology, communication, etc. So you cannot say that I have become inactive.": "Sharad",
  "We have to realize only in communication, in real knowledge, in real reaching out, can there be an understanding that there's humanity everywhere, and that's what I'm trying to do.": "Mira",
  "In the years preceding my imprisonment, I worked as a software programmer, designing and developing web interfaces, secure databases, and communication software; later, I was employed as an intelligence analyst for the U.S. Army. Throughout each of these jobs, we used different kinds of encryption to keep prying eyes out of information we handled.": "Chelsea",
  "Shiv Nadar University has five schools with 16 departments offering 14 undergraduate, 10 master's and 13 doctoral programmes. The demand for engineering courses - computer science, engineering, electronics, communication engineering, mechanical engineering - is slightly on the higher side compared to other engineering courses.": "Shiv",
  "Honest communication is a rare thing.": "Taylor",
  "'Instagram' is a media company. I think we're about visual media. I explain ourselves as a disruptive entertainment platform that enables communication through visual media. I don't think it's just photos.": "Kevin",
  "Just so everyone knows, we're not a photo-sharing company. I don't see photos on 'Instagram' as art. They're much more about communication.": "Kevin",
  "I feel like communication is the same whether you're cooking for someone or singing or writing a song or writing a play or ordering from McDonald's.": "Tituss",
  "Although social media is a relatively new form of communication, it has become the primary way retailers and customers are interfacing.": "Ryan",
  "It's extraordinary that revolutions taking place around the world were sparked by communication on the Internet.": "Robbie",
  "Reclassification is the best way to for us to preserve the Internet as an unfettered tool for communication and the sharing of ideas.": "Chuck",
  "I think, increasingly, despite what we are being told is an ever more open world of communication, there is a terrible alienation in the ordinary man between what he is being told and what he secretly believes.": "John",
  "Communication is important.": "Douglas",
  "Contractions, 'U' for 'you' and the like are wonderful to make communication brief and efficient - but we wouldn't want all our talk to be only brief and efficient. Taking pauses out of language would be like taking the net away from a tennis game. Where would all the fun go?": "Pico",
  "On 'Check Your Head' and 'Ill Communication,' most of the lyrics are much more, 'OK, you take that, and I'll say that' - they're split up.": "Mike",
  "I spent a lot of years on the road, and what happens is you find out who your real friends are and you find out where your strengths and weaknesses lie in communication. I've had the same friends for 20 years now and I can count them on one hand.": "Sarah",
  "Revelation is communication from God to His children on the earth and one of the great blessings associated with the gift and constant companionship of the Holy Ghost.": "David",
  "In elementary school, we should teach nonviolent conflict resolution and healthy communication skills, which will help children cope with issues like rejection and sexuality later in life.": "Jane",
  "I don't think there's such a thing as a selfish prayer. Prayer puts you in communication so you can talk about whatever you want to talk about.": "Iyanla",
  "I always find that there is a real communication between voice and violin.": "Itzhak",
  "I believe that no matter what you do in life, if you learn the basics through theater, it will help you in everything else - problem solving, communication, discipline, all of that stuff.": "Laura",
  "With communication technology in general, there's a kind of certain critical mass of people. Once you get to 15% of the world's entire population using one communication technology, that's a big deal. It's beyond the theoretical at this point. The people who think it's a fad have probably not been paying that much attention.": "Ben",
  "It is very helpful to me, in my job, for people to know me better. A lot of that is, it's a communication job.": "Ben",
  "As I've gotten to know myself over the years, I realised I'm kind of a sweet, sensitive guy, a shy guy, and communication is not something I'm so good at.": "Christian",
  "With clearly defined roles and a focus on communication, it's much easier to make your company come across as well-organized and on top of things - because it actually is.": "Kathryn",
  "I hate the amount of communication, the obligation that you have just by owning a phone.": "Lucas",
  "Scientology helps me in acting to focus on communication.": "Erika",
  "I can be a binger when it comes to information, but most of the time, I'm pretty good, and I try to focus on my own life and personal communication.": "Erika",
  "Vocal rest is awesome. It is like any kind of fast. Firstly, it is a purification of speech. It made me realize how not careful I am with the things I say. It also makes you find new ways of communication and new methods to connect with people.": "Matisyahu",
  "There are many deaf people who couldn't imagine living in a marriage without someone who doesn't speak their language. For me, I believe that hearing or deaf is fine as long as both parties are willing to communicate in each other's language. But if there's no communication, then the marriage, I believe, will be difficult if not doomed.": "Marlee",
  "The Internet is a clear example of how our lives have changed in ways we couldn't have imagined: a distributed information source, which is invisible to everyone, where you can access anything, and it's distributed throughout the whole world. Basically, communication is instantaneous.": "Lawrence",
  "Language as a communication tool is the primary element from which literature is created. Even in pre-literate societies, it exists as songs, riddles, or epics that are chanted.": "F.",
  "'Arrival' talks very little about language and how to precisely dissect a foreign language. It's more a film on intuition and communication by intuition, the language of intuition.": "Denis",
  "I am still cautiously hopeful about the potential of the Internet. But it seems that the greatest revolution in communication has been hijacked by commercial values.": "Beeban",
  "There's been nobody who stays in more communication and listens to veterans more than I do.": "Rodney",
  "I think everyone has shame about something, whether it's a lack of a relationship with a child or maybe their weight or a lack of communication within their marriage. Everyone can relate to that because we all have something that we're like, 'God, I can work on that,' or, 'I wish I was better at doing this.'": "Chrissy",
  "Obama better understood community organisation and peer-to-peer communication than any recent candidate, and we are applying that lesson.": "Douglas",
  "I enjoy very much communication. I think that scientists need to communicate.": "Anthony",
  "There must be a reason why photographers are not very good at verbal communication. I think we get lazy.": "Annie",
  "What does music mean to me? I don't think I would really be much without it, without it coming through me. It's my means of communication, my means of growth, my means of transportation from one point in my life to another.": "Erykah",
  "Coach Pederson, for me, the communication we have is clear, and it's an open line. He really respects my opinion on plays. If I'm feeling something... he instills a lot of confidence in me. That is huge.": "Carson",
  "I have a very open line of communication with both my children.": "Gloria",
  "My wife and I have built trust with our children and have always had open communication.": "Rick",
  "He that communicates his secret to another makes himself that other's slave.": "Baltasar",
  "What I try to get beyond is playing music at people and, instead, to play music with people because audience members are constantly part of the experience. What they say in their body language, what they say in their eyes, what they sing with me... it's an 'us,' and there's a communication that's like... it's like church, man.": "Al",
  "It is true that the Internet can be used to disseminate falsehoods quickly, but it just as quickly roots them out and exposes them in a way that the traditional model of journalism and its closed, insular, one-way form of communication could never do.": "Glenn",
  "In a way song writing can almost be detrimental, because suddenly you find an outlet that is a kind of cheating. You don't need to have direct communication. You can say, 'I can't describe it to you, but I will record it and send it to you.'": "James",
  "Pure truth cannot be assimilated by the crowd it must be communicated by contagion. ": "Henri",
  "For me, good service is efficient and discreet; it's that critical balance. As soon as the client sits down, the communication flow has to start. Customers need to feel that the waiters are supervised - that there's a system in place.": "Daniel",
  "I believe in communication books communicate ideas and make bridges between people. ": "Jeanette",
  "I don't think there has been enough communication between the players and the tournaments. In one sense it's just as much the players' fault. Players talk between each other and in the locker room about things that can be improved and then when the time comes to talk and really do something about it they stop.": "Novak",
  "I like television. I still believe that television is the most powerful form of communication on Earth - I just hate what is being done with it.": "Alton",
  "The Internet has given us 10 or 15 new styles of communication: long messages like blogging, and then short messages like texting and tweeting. I see it all as part of an expanding array of linguistic possibilities.": "David",
  "A word carries far, very far, deals destruction through time as the bullets go flying through space.": "Joseph",
  "I speak onstage to try to establish some method of communication. The songs are supposed to be a way of communicating. But speech and drinks and sometimes chocolates are also a way of communicating.": "Jarvis",
  "Suspense films are often based on communication problems, and that affects all of the plot points. It almost gives it kind of a fable feeling.": "Ira",
  "We are not advertising ourselves as a secure platform. It's a communication platform. It's not our job to police the world or Snapchat of jerks.": "Evan",
  "Loyalty and communication are always rewarded in sports.": "Cheech",
  "Instantaneous and mass communication is the mother of mass naivety. Should we then lose hope? Is there any hope? But to lose hope is as dangerous as to nurture false hope. Where then can we find hope that is responsible?": "Tariq",
  "The thing that I've always been slightly frustrated with, was that the idea of a CD is kind of confined to a material possession that you can put on a shelf. And the idea of music, for me, is always about both the communication and the sharing of content. And so the interactive part is missing.": "Yo-Yo",
  "A monopoly on the means of communication may define a ruling elite more precisely than the celebrated Marxian formula of monopoly in the means of production.": "Robert",
  "My theory on an existing crisis is that you have to be very strategic about each case's unique elements. If a crisis involves a legal component, you need a communication strategy that complements the company's legal objective. A strategy for a plea deal is different than a case going to trial.": "Judy",
  "Up until the 1960s, women would meet designers in their private ateliers, and together they would build a relationship and a wardrobe. Then, all of a sudden, designers disappeared into their own private bubble, and there was no communication.": "Edgardo",
  "Communication isn't just directing a guy on what to do: it's passing the information along to the guy that's next to you, and that's where we make the calls come to life.": "Dan",
  "The thing I've come to learn is that what's great about small independent films is the intimacy and the communication that occurs when you're making them.": "Guy",
  "The level of communication you can achieve with an infant is really profound.": "Mayim",
  "'The Haunted Man' is about communication barriers between men and women, and in that song it's a woman's wait for her husband to come back from war. The vision for me was of a group of men and women on the opposite sides of two cliffs, trying to move or sing to each other and communicate, but they're kind of misfiring.": "Bat",
  "No ideas and the ability to express them - that's a journalist.": "Karl",
  "Nonverbal communication forms a social language that is in many ways richer and more fundamental than our words.": "Leonard",
  "Scientists attach great importance to the human capacity for spoken language. But we also have a parallel track of nonverbal communication, which may reveal more than our carefully chosen words, and sometimes be at odds with them.": "Leonard",
  "One of the most surprising forms of nonverbal communication is the way we automatically adjust the amount of time we spend looking into another's eyes as a function of our relative social position.": "Leonard",
  "Touch is our most highly developed sense when we are born, and it remains a fundamental mode of communication throughout a baby's first year and an important influence throughout a person's life.": "Leonard",
  "There's a high level of communication between all of us at Marvel, and between Marvel and Lucasfilm.": "Jason",
  "We need men and women to sit down and talk to each other about sex honestly and openly. That would help us fight Aids so immediately. But our lack of communication is hugely problematic.": "Emma",
  "And it's absolutely true that male sexual behaviour and female responses to male demands change a lot when they start communicating - and the levels of the communication that I've seen on the ground in very, very poor areas are so high and I think why don't we have that here?": "Emma",
  "All the people who run agencies, all the important people in agencies have taken communication courses, marketing courses, advertising courses, and courses basically teach advertising as a science, and advertising is so far from a science it isn't even funny. Advertising is an art.": "George",
  "The 1960s was a heroic age in the history of the art of communication - the audacious movers and shakers of those times bear no resemblance to the cast of characters in 'Mad Men.'": "George",
  "Communication between band-mates is imperative. Communication is the key to any healthy relationship. If I need to be checked, I expect to hear it put in plain words what my faults are, and give my band-mates the ultimate consideration by shutting up and listening, then acting on the advice given. Same goes for anyone else in any band.": "Phil",
  "Anonymous blog comments, vapid video pranks and lightweight mash-ups may seem trivial and harmless, but as a whole, this widespread practice of fragmentary, impersonal communication has demeaned personal interaction.": "Jaron",
  "Being a good Hans Haacke student, part of his influence on me is that there's no difference between a gallery show and a film - or even an ad and a T-shirt-in terms of cultural legitimacy. They're just different contexts in which to have some sort of communication.": "Mike",
  "I really think that music itself, being one of the greatest possible vehicles for mass communication, should be probed to its extremes, to see how effective it can actually become, which is one of the reasons why I became also interested in presenting political points of view.": "Ruben",
  "I find that I have about six bloggable ideas a day. I also find that writing twice as long a post doesn't increase communication, it usually decreases it. And finally, I found that people get antsy if there are unread posts in their queue.": "Seth",
  "The waste basket is the writer's best friend.": "Isaac",
  "What I like in a good author is not what he says but what he whispers.": "Logan",
  "The disturbing truth about science communication is that we have theories and ways of delivering messages that really are like putting a candle to the dark, as Carl Sagan would say. We aren't sure what will work, when, or how much. But for all that uncertainty, that doesn't mean we shouldn't try.": "Kyle",
  "With 'The Sixth Sense,' my dad and I discussed how this was not so much a horror story as a story about communication. I understudied with my dad, in a sense. It made a huge difference.": "Haley",
  "For there to be communication within a couple, it is enough for there to be only one person who communicates or who really wants to communicate. Even though a couple consists of two people, if one of the people in a couple puts all their effort into moving a couple along they will move along.": "Pedro",
  "Music is about communication... it isn't just something that maybe physically sounds good or orally sounds interesting; it's something far, far deeper than that.": "Evelyn",
  "There are a lot of things that Slack gives you that email doesn't when you think about internal use. Switching to Slack from email for internal communication gives you a lot more transparency.": "Stewart",
  "To conclude: good journalism is one of the models of good conversation and communication in the wider social context.": "Rowan",
  "Sometimes words are not needed, and the simplicity of expressing yourself through an art form is one of the best ways of communication.": "Emmanuel",
  "I always felt it was necessary to keep up some kind of communication with other people.": "Norman",
  "Communication is an issue where we can improve, and if I can do anything to help, I am happy to.": "Ellen",
  "I slept for four years. I didn't study much of anything. I majored in something called communication arts.": "Don",
  "Every major communication tool on the Internet has spam and abuse problems. All email services, blogging services and social networks have to dedicate a significant amount of resources and time to fighting abuse and protecting their users.": "Evan",
  "I would admit that poetry is something more than mere communication and that if that 'something more' could be abstracted from the whole, it might well prove to be that which makes the whole a poem.": "Louis",
  "What is music anyway? It's a form of communication, and that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.": "Kenny",
  "I mean, what is music anyway? It's a form of communication - at least for me it is. And that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.": "Kenny",
  "Sure, I love people, and I want to communicate with people. I mean, what is music anyway? It's a form of communication - at least for me it is. And that's why I play the kind of music that I think - that I hope - can communicate with people.": "Kenny",
  "Around the time I began starving, in the early eighties, the visual image had begun to supplant text as culture's primary mode of communication, a radical change because images work so differently than words: They're immediate, they hit you at levels way beneath intellect, they come fast and furious.": "Caroline",
  "My personal view about how people should use Twitter is less relevant than our goal to provide the infrastructure for a new kind of communication and then support the creativity that emerges.": "Biz",
  "I never even wanted to be an actress. I studied mass communication and wanted to study law in Newcastle, for which I even got a scholarship. But by then, I had started modelling. So, I took a year off to decide what to do. But once you are used to working, it's difficult to get back to studies.": "Esha",
  "Music is about communication, and the chemistry between an audience and the orchestra is absolutely essential; the performance does not exist in a bubble.": "Charles",
  "We are more and more into technology. Everything is texting, and everything is instant. Flowers are completely impractical as a method of communication when you could just send a text.": "Vanessa",
  "The National Surveillance State doesn't want anyone to be able to communicate without the authorities being able to monitor that communication.": "Barry",
  "Writing has nothing to do with communication between person and person, only with communication between different parts of a person's mind.": "Rebecca",
  "Democracy is interactive... It's a constant job of information, education, explanation, listening, and interactive communication.": "Dick",
  "You should have mechanisms of communication, like faxes, which are obviously getting removed from offices because nobody uses them anymore. Faxes are great when e-mail doesn't work. I wouldn't be throwing them away.": "Mikko",
  "It has to be able to play at the maximum expression and communication in every style, and the only way you can do that is - like Verdi said - working with a file, every day, little by little, until the orchestra's collective qualities emerge.": "James",
  "The way you communicate an idea is different than the way you communicate a product.": "Frank",
  "I don't understand why people whose entire lives or their corporate success depends on communication, and yet they are led on occasion by CEOs who cannot talk their way out of a paper bag and don't care to.": "Frank",
  "There are people still in the Republican Party that I believe practice the communication of anger, of disappointment, of regret, of pain, of sorrow, of suffering. That's not what the American people want to hear.": "Frank",
  "Republicans use think tanks to come up with a lot of their messages. The think tanks are the single worst, most undisciplined example of communication I've ever seen.": "Frank",
  "Ideology and communication more often than not run into each other rather than complement each other. Principle and communication work together. Ideology and communication often work apart.": "Frank",
  "I love the rehearsal process in the theatre, and the visceral sense of contact and communication with a live audience.": "Judd",
  "Language cares.": "Howard",
  "I didn't know folk music growing up, no. It's something I've come to study, really, because I think there's so much to learn from traditional music in the sense of the way music began as a way of communication, the traveling storyteller, the bard, the minstrels.": "P.",
  "Politics is a matter of human transaction. I consider absolutely everything political, because all fiction involves relationships between people, and relationships between people always include matters of power, of equity, of communication.": "Deborah",
  "Fashion shows are really my way of communication.": "Dries",
  "As much as I encourage communication with my readers, I don't want reviews from them, simply because I don't need to be hamstrung in the middle of working on something.": "Christopher",
  "I'm talking to you and it's basically a direct communication, whereas if I'm writing a letter to you and you read the letter, there are like 12 extra deconstruction and reconstruction steps in the communication.": "Kevin",
  "My father had a big brick cell phone, before anyone had a cell phone, because he was really just into that kind of thing - communication devices. I grew up between my father's laboratory and my mother's library.": "Rashid",
  "Most people that derail as leaders in the corporate world, it's not because they couldn't do the math and calculate return on investment properly. The issues are communication and understanding. All of what typically would've been called the 'soft stuff.' You have to be authentic. You have to be dialed into the soft stuff.": "Douglas",
  "The filmmaking process is a very personal one to me, I mean it really is a personal kind of communication. It's not as though its a study of fear or any of that stuff.": "David",
  "I started on the use of the Internet for scientific communication. Our research group was one of the very first to make really systematic use of it as a way of managing research projects.": "Joshua",
  "The waste of capital, in proportion to the total capital, in this country between 1800 and 1850, in the attempts which were made to establish means of communication and transportation, was enormous.": "William",
  "All my life, I've been working with male directors, which I've really enjoyed. And I'm lucky in that I've worked with men who have a lot of respect for women. But working with a woman is a different experience. It feels like the communication is different.": "Gal",
  "Quite frankly, the Urban brand organization became too siloed, with too little communication across functional areas. The great creativity that has been the hallmark of our success became stifled.": "Richard",
  "I don't think that VR is going to lead to humanity being enslaved in the matrix or letting the world crumble around us. I think it's going to end up being a great technology that brings closer people together, that allows for better communication, that reduces a lot of environmental waste that we're currently doing in the real world.": "Palmer",
  "I'm a huge fan of online communities. I think that asynchronous internet-based communication forums such as Reddit and other discussion forums are one of the best things that could possibly have happened to collaborative invention. The Rift certainly would not exist without forums.": "Palmer",
  "The decisions we make about communication security today will determine the kind of society we live in tomorrow.": "Whitfield",
  "We're moving into an era when things are dematerialised and much more holographic. Floating above the physical world and the geographic map, there's another landscape that's constantly changing - something like a cloud - of communication, information, exchange and commerce.": "Doug",
  "Communication is paramount, and what medium or what format you utilize should be a non-issue. In some respects, that has created a barrier for new media, especially web new media, because often times maybe the media itself comes before the concept, before the ideas, and ends up navigating or dictating the outcome.": "Doug",
  "Walt put everything he knew about communication with images into the park, so it was very familiar.": "John",
  "A painting has a lot of advantages over other forms of communication. Unlike a movie, you don't have to put it into a machine and turn it on. It's just there every day. It's not limited by the element of time. It's a constant part of the home.": "Thomas",
  "Without a possibility of change in meanings human communication could not perform its present functions.": "Kenneth",
  "I am in favor of complete freedom of information and of free access to the new communication tools, in particular the Internet.": "Omar",
  "I try to just communicate what I want done as clearly and simply as possible.": "Dick",
  "People recognize certain things, like 'D' means 'this dialogue stinks.' We're dealing with shows that are written here, shot in New York and posted back here. Accurate communication is a necessity.": "Dick",
  "I am no technophobe. I like being able to calibrate communication, depending on the situation - texting for the simple and immediate; email for business or when I want to put some lag time into the exchange; Twitter to promote something; Facebook to draw a crowd.": "David",
  "Who would know but ten years ago that kids would be texting each other all the time, that that would be one of their main forms of communication.": "Amy",
  "Music is a very personal and emotional form of communication.": "Trevor",
  "When first starting to work with someone you try to get them in the same mindset that you were in when you were successful, and I realized the best thing you can ever do is realize that they are not you. They have a different persona and mindset, and you have to figure out what works best within your communication with that athlete.": "Dan",
  "Whether we're conscious of it or not, our work and personal lives are made up of daily rituals, including when we eat our meals, how we shower or groom, or how we approach our daily descent into the digital world of email communication.": "Chip",
  "Anybody who thinks that getting a communication from a voter in your district is spam - that guy is pork. Roast pork unless he changes his point of view.": "Dick",
  "Thinking of Internet chat rooms or AIM as a kind - there's such an intimacy and honesty to tapping on your phone, despite how quick people are to damn digital means of communication as emotionless or too abstract.": "Liv",
  "With my natural communication abilities, I could probably gather a crowd even without the Spirit.": "Francis",
  "I follow my conscience - and this is upsetting to some people, but I maintain the conscience is going to be the only thing between us and communication in the future.": "Matt",
  "To pray is to have a conversation with Deity. This sacred and supernal communication with Heavenly Father is a divine and delicate process. This crucial communication should be conducted with great care and in compliance with sacred counsel.": "L.",
  "May we treasure the divine gift of communication, and may we use it wisely to build and to assist others on this marvelous journey through mortality.": "L.",
  "You know, Quincy Jones was a great mentor, but he was a man in a man's world. Fortunately he's a very sensitive man and a beautiful human being, and even though he was 14 or 15 years older than me, he's a capable human being and has great communication skills.": "Lesley",
  "What I'm primarily responsible for is products. Everything is developed with my personal involvement. Second is client communication. Everything to do with product and consumer is my primary focus. I also deal with everything which relates to investment and partnership. Distribution, finance, administration, I don't do.": "Roustam",
  "As a whole, the managers today are different in temperament. Most have very good communication skills and are more understanding of the umpire's job. That doesn't mean they are better managers. It just means that I perceive today's managers a bit differently.": "Jim",
  "It seems a long time since the morning mail could be called correspondence.": "Jacques",
  "Language is an inadequate form of communication. If you've picked up an instrument, it's because you don't feel you are communicating sufficiently.": "Stephen",
  "Unlike then, the mail stream of today has diminished by such things as e-mails and faxes and cell phones and text messages, largely electronic means of communication that replace mail.": "John",
  "A more consistent and sustainable relationship with China will be a core goal of my administration. That requires open channels of communication, both with China's leadership and the Taiwanese people.": "Tsai",
  "Yet, in spite of this world-wide system of linkages, there is, at this very moment, a general feeling that communication is breaking down everywhere, on an unparalleled scale.": "David",
  "Twitter was around communication and visualizing what was happening in the world in real-time. Square was allowing everyone to accept the form of payment people have in their pocket today, which is a credit card.": "Jack",
  "A good catchword can obscure analysis for fifty years.": "Wendell",
  "We don't communicate in full sentences anyway. We don't need all those words.": "Shepard",
  "There's all these ways to instantly communicate - cars, computers, telephone and transportation - and even with all that, it's so hard to find people and have an honest communication with them.": "Jason",
  "On the other hand, the American public possesses a great resilience and strength, and good risk communication strategies can tap into and even amplify those assets.": "Patrick",
  "Without form, communication stops... without form, you have everybody burbling on to themselves, whenever and however, things that no one else can understand and - rightly - no one else is interested in.": "Gerhard",
  "These sites have torn down the geographical divide that once prevented long distance social relationships from forming, allowing instant communication and connections to take place and a virtual second life to take hold for its users.": "Mike",
  "The Internet has brought communities across the globe closer together through instant communication.": "Mike",
  "People aren't going to talk about it except me and that is communication and the visits I have personally had in our meetings with our store managers saying if you do these things you will be terminated, period.": "Lee",
  "One of the things that amazes me about Twitter is the way it utterly eradicates artificial barriers to communication. Things like status, geopolitics and so on keep people from talking to one another. Those go away in Twitter. You see exchanges that would never happen anywhere else.": "Dick",
  "There are certain words which are nearer and dearer to a man than any others.": "Nikolai",
  "Measured in time of transport and communication, the whole round globe is now smaller than a small European country was a hundred years ago.": "John",
  "Wikipedia was a big help for science, especially science communication, and it shows no sign of diminishing in importance.": "Aubrey",
  "In communications, familiarity breeds apathy.": "William",
  "Language commonly stresses only one side of any interaction.": "Gregory",
  "But I'm acutely aware that the possibility of fraud is even more prevalent in today's world because of the Internet and cell phones and the opportunity for instant communication with strangers.": "Armistead",
  "The thing I do, really, is a communication with audiences more than any achievement through records.": "Richard",
  "Music is the major form of communication. It's the commonest vibration, the people's news broadcast, especially for kids.": "Richie",
  "Many times, people have come up to me after singing some songs, and they'd say, 'Richie, do you know what you did?' And I'd say, 'What?' And they'd go, 'I wrote these songs down for you to sing, and you sang them all in a row.' But that's the kind of communication that happens, you know.": "Richie",
  "The inventions and the great discoveries have opened up whole continents to reciprocal communication and interchange, provided we are willing.": "Alva",
  "Eventually, it is found out but it takes time especially in the conditions when communication is difficult, when the enemy is making it extremely awkward for information to come out, to go.": "Joe",
  "In this great age of communication, there a lot of people you can't actually understand. I know everyone tweets, and twits and texts and all that, but actually we've all got voices, and it is awfully nice to hear them and if you can understand what people are saying.": "Penelope",
  "When ministers in this government talk about investing in education and skills, about making the planning system work; about employment law reform and delivering transport and power generation and broadband communication infrastructure, we are talking about raising Britain's productivity.": "Philip",
  "I think there's a worry that an excessive use or an almost exclusive use of text and emails means that as a society we're losing some of the ability to build interpersonal communication that's necessary for living together and building a community.": "Vincent",
  "As a graduate student at Oxford in 1963, I began writing about books in revolutionary France, helping to found the discipline of book history. I was in my academic corner writing about Enlightenment ideals when the Internet exploded the world of academic communication in the 1990s.": "Robert",
  "I'm a child of the sixties. I grew up with a president who was a crook, who put us into the most unpopular war in history, who had no communication with people under thirty. I had seen the Symbionese Liberation Army and the Panthers and the Diggers; I understood what they were about.": "Jerry",
  "In my teaching, I enjoyed creating models to clearly communicate my thoughts.": "Erno",
  "Nurses serve their patients in the most important capacities. We know that they serve as our first lines of communication when something goes wrong or when we are concerned about health.": "Lois",
  "Mothers tend to be more direct. Fathers talk to other fathers about their kids more metaphorically. It's a different way of communication.": "Richard",
  "But if I can be convinced and then through the work that we do together, the orchestra can really be convinced of the big sweep of that communication that the piece suggests, then the audience will get it and it will be a good experience for all of us.": "Michael",
  "States are looking for low-cost solutions that will enable better communication, while avoiding the danger in which the chain of command breaks down in emergencies. We do not want everyone talking to everyone else all the time.": "John",
  "Every single means of communication amongst the public, the government has antennae into, to find out who is liable to be sympathetic and who is not liable to be sympathetic, and I think this has probably been going on since all channels of communication began.": "David",
  "It's so important in marriage to let the little things go and let the pride go. Forgiveness is so important, and communication. Don't major on the minors.": "Kimberly",
  "I wasn't rebellious. Other friends had far stricter parents and where there wasn't a relationship of respect and communication, they were usually the opposite; kids go to the other extreme.": "Randa",
  "If I'm doing a show on Sunday at 7 P.M., that wouldn't be the same show that I'd do at 11 P.M. on a Saturday - it's a different room at a different time of day with different sensibilities. That doesn't mean you have to compromise your art, but it is communication: you have to know how to talk to people.": "Michael",
  "From my time at Nokia, I've seen the 99% positive and occasionally negative impact that communication tools can have on people.": "Jan",
  "It is vital that the United States maintains open lines of communication with our allies. We must assure them of our commitment to eradicating global terrorism wherever it may reside or wherever it's given haven.": "George",
  "Texting is a supremely secretive medium of communication - it's like passing a note - and this means we should be very careful what we use it for.": "Lynne",
  "That was when I realised that music is the most profound, magical form of communication there is.": "Lesley",
  "I'm glad you asked that question, because of any musical situation I've been in, the communication feels great here with Russell. He really pays close attention to what I'm doing because he cares.": "Benny",
  "There is no roles. No one is keeping any roles. The drummer is also answering everybody and everything. So it is a constant conversation and communication between musicians on an extremely high level with extremely valuable material, motifs, and melodies.": "Miroslav",
  "History has demonstrated that efforts to censure and control communication will not succeed.": "Ricardo",
  "I'm not the first person to say this, but communication at 'SNL' - I don't want to say it's not good, but unless you ask questions, you will not know what's going on.": "Pete",
  "Trust is the most important part of a relationship, closely followed by communication. I think that if you have those two things, everything else falls into place - your affection, your emotional connection.": "Vanessa",
  "Product investment, quality management, and all the things that are key for a car company - great, there has been no compromise in those aspects. But I feel there's a lot we could do on communication, particularly from a Chinese perspective.": "Li",
  "So as I look at transitioning to the communication platforms of the future, I see that the beauty of Internet protocols is you get the separation of the layers between service and technology.": "Michael",
  "I use a Blackberry. I'm so behind on mobile communication technology, I think a smartwatch may be too far a leap.": "Derek",
  "The process of communication with the afterlife - more of an exchange than a conversation - has always fascinated me.": "Rory",
  "Why did God give me two ears and one mouth? So that I will hear more and talk less.": "Leo",
  "Being a good television screenwriter requires an understanding of the way film accelerates the communication of words.": "Steven",
  "The church acknowledges some Scientologists choose to sever communications with family members who leave. The church says it is a fundamental human right to cease communication with someone. It adds disconnection is used against expelled members and those who attack the church.": "John",
  "Sometimes I worry that science communication is just preaching to the choir, speaking to the converted. Social media gives us an amazing opportunity to reach new people.": "Elise",
  "By and large, the critics and readers gave me an affirmed sense of my identity as a writer. You might know this within yourself, but to have it affirmed by others is of utmost importance. Writing is, after all, a form of communication.": "Ralph",
  "I think the greatest challenge between child and parent is communication.": "Sean",
  "We emphasize that such a form of communication is not absent in man, however evanescent a naturally given object may be for him, split as it is in its submission to symbols.": "Jacques",
  "The need to write comes from the need to make sense of one's life and discover one's usefulness.": "John",
  "People seem to see no difference between an intimate conversation and a conversation at the water cooler.": "Mike",
  "But despite the universality of URLs, we often forget that they're not just a handy way to address network resources. They're also valuable communication tools.": "Jesse",
  "If you look at the history of communication, new technologies like the phone and e-mail didn't just let people do things faster; it fundamentally changed the scope of the kinds of projects people dared to take on.": "Justin",
  "I learned mime back when I was in college, at Ball State University, Indiana. That woke up my body from the neck down and made me realize that acting and communication - portraying a story, event, or emotion - is a full-body experience.": "Doug",
  "The break down for kids is communication. Music helps bring that bond.": "Sheila",
  "Poetry is the communication through words of certain experiences that can be communicated in no other way.": "John",
  "Know when to email vs. when to meet. Logistics are best handled over a non-immediate communication channel like email or Asana tasks. Detailed status meetings will suck the life out of your day.": "Justin",
  "Missions is not about sending missionaries, and missions is not about doing missions. Missions is about the communication of truth to men.": "Paul",
  "If we ever start communicating with living creatures from other planets, the number one priority is, how are you going to communicate information? Even between different cultures here on Earth, you get into communication problems.": "Story",
  "Their spirituality was in nature, even though Emerson was a preacher on the pulpit, he ended up going out into nature for direct, face-to-face communication with God, if you want to call all of this creation part of God.": "Story",
  "For me, the perfect film has no dialogue at all. It's purely a visual, emotional, visceral kind of experience. And I think one can create wonderful depth and meaning and communication without using words. I started out as an illustrator and a cartoonist and caricature artist, so for me the visual is primary.": "Bill",
  "My daughter Stacia was born when I was 31, after I was divorced from David, and she was my gift to myself. She was just a joy because I didn't have the stress of a male irritating me, and I vowed that I would make absolutely certain that between her and me there would be a clear line of communication at all times.": "Angela",
  "Now it is evident that a little insight into the customs of every people is necessary to insure a kindly communication; this, joined with patience and kindness, will seldom fail with the natives of the interior.": "Charles",
  "I've taken a philosophical position on e-mail. Although I think it's a wonderful communication technology, and it has a lot of good uses, it is abused quite a lot.": "Alan",
  "I think each film I do has less and less dialogue. It really helps a lot for foreign sales, because when I go to Europe, there's very little problem with communication. All the gags are visual. The music they can understand, and it helps communicate a lot better.": "Bill",
  "I don't think that TV on the Radio is some dark mysterious band that no one can know about. We write music because it's an immediate form of communication. We're able to put on record what's happening in our times, and we want that message to be heard by the most amount of people.": "Dave",
  "Canada's a huge country, so to be able to unite the country through communication satellite technology or to be able to observe it through remote sensing technology from space is a natural fit for a country like Canada.": "Marc",
  "The eventual place the American army should take on the western front was to a large extent influenced by the vital question of communication and supply.": "Kelly",
  "I shall suggest, on the contrary, that all communication relies, to a noticeable extent on evoking knowledge that we cannot tell, and that all our knowledge of mental processes, like feelings or conscious intellectual activities, is based on a knowledge which we cannot tell.": "Michael",
  "America is a noisy culture, unlike, say, Finland, which values silence. Individualism, dominant in the U.S. and Germany, promotes the direct, fast-paced style of communication associated with extraversion. Collectivistic societies, such as those in East Asia, value privacy and restraint, qualities more characteristic of introverts.": "Laurie",
  "Yes, it must be something that goes very well with my voice, let's say something that I understand that this would be good communication with the others, and I don't pretend for instance, to look for music that would be something that doesn't go with my personality.": "Victoria",
  "People could live very happily without the Turner Prize, but they could not live without real communication and emotion.": "Billy",
  "A communication highway without content is inconceivable.": "Hubert",
  "We've been trying to open the gates of communication between Havana and Miami through art, which is apolitical most of the time: It doesn't have anything to do with politics and is only an exchange of ideas.": "Jorge",
  "Significant officials at publicly traded companies are casually and cavalierly engaged in insider trading. Because insider trading has as one of its elements communication, it doesn't take rocket science to realize it's nice to have the communication on tape.": "Preet",
  "I do not pretend to know precisely what is on foot there; but I think it pretty evident that there is a very free communication between that country and this body, and unless I am greatly mistaken, I see the dwarfish medium by which that communication is kept up.": "Benjamin",
  "Gradually I became aware of details: a company of French soldiers was marching through the streets of the town. They broke formation, and went in single file along the communication trench leading to the front line. Another group followed them.": "Ernst",
  "Today, comics is one of the very few forms of mass communication in which individual voices still have a chance to be heard.": "Scott",
  "I don't start with a design objective, I start with a communication objective. I feel my project is successful if it communicates what it is supposed to communicate.": "Mike",
  "I didn't have a lot of communication with Elvis. You had to go through a barricade to get to Elvis. It was people hanging on every word, and I felt very uncomfortable a lot of times.": "Mac",
  "Texting is a lot like an answering machine. If you don't want to talk to somebody, it's like screening your calls. To me, it's a way of communication, but not one that I favor.": "Pat",
  "I'm a very physical person. I'm very tactile. I wrestled in college, so a lot of my communication with the world comes through physicality - what I take in and what I put out there.": "Gbenga",
  "In the numerous observations made in my laboratory upon this object, we have only once seen a combination of vessels in which there might be a direct communication between a small artery and a vein, though the two observers could not come to a final conclusion on the point.": "August",
  "In a way, architecture is about communication. That's an aspect of the discipline that is somewhat lacking, and there's definitely room for more progression into that area. I suppose that gives me a bit of a different edge. I'm also very, very used to doing a lot of exhaustive research and finding interesting information from different sources.": "Magnus",
  "On the other hand, in a society whose communication component is becoming more prominent day by day, both as a reality and as an issue, it is clear that language assumes a new importance.": "Jean-Francois",
  "The limits of sensory evolution in fish are defined very largely by their habitat. Water is physically supportive, carries some kinds of odour well, and is kind to sound - letting it travel several times faster than air will allow, but it inhibits other more personal kinds of communication.": "Lyall",
  "It is not enough to show people how to live better: there is a mandate for any group with enormous powers of communication to show people how to be better.": "Marya",
  "It's never what you say, but how you make it sound sincere.": "Marya",
  "Writing is communication, and you don't know how you're doing until you put it in front of someone else's eyes. You also learn from critiquing other writers' work.": "Carol",
  "The Internet has changed everything. We expect to know everything instantly. If you don't understand digital communication, you're at a disadvantage.": "Bob",
  "A world community can exist only with world communication, which means something more than extensive short-wave facilities scattered; about the globe. It means common understanding, a common tradition, common ideas, and common ideals.": "Robert",
  "Cove is essentially a collaboration, coordination and communication tool for the administration of organizations and communities, from the Stanford Graduate School of Business Entrepreneurship Club to church groups and schools.": "Ruchi",
  "Wise people say nothing in dangerous times.": "John",
  "People break down after a couple of hours. All the defenses go down, and there's a kind of communication that if I spent 20 years in a living room with one of these people, I would never, never know as much about them as I do in that one day.": "Lee",
  "We know that communication must be hampered, and its form largely determined, by the unconscious but inevitable influence of a transmitting mechanism, whether that be of a merely mechanical or of a physiological character.": "Oliver",
  "The other thing about FEMA, my understanding is that it was supposed to move into the Department of Homeland Security... and be what it was, but also having a lot of lateral communication with all those others involved in that issue of homeland security.": "Warren",
  "My mother and I always had full adult communication.": "Erin",
  "By supporting all the links in the building chain and giving them an easy, intuitive tool for sharing model-based project information, GTeam enhances workflows and improves communication from design through to fabrication and assembly.": "Greg",
  "My mother was a very talented artist. When she was in jail, we'd write letters back and forth; that was pretty much the only form of communication we had.": "Jarrett",
  "It sounds so trite but in relationships, you have to communicate.": "Peter",
  "With docs, there's often a very direct communication between the filmmaker and the audience. With narrative movies, we leave it a little bit more open.": "Tom",
  "I never told a victim story about my imprisonment. Instead, I told a transformation story - about how prison changed my outlook, about how I saw that communication, truth, and trust are at the heart of power.": "Fernando",
  "A lot of the music editing job is communication and working out what a director really wants the music to be.": "Steven",
  "I don't think I set out to have a career in female groups, but it's just kind of happened, and by nature of having worked with my sister - growing up with a sister who also plays, and being in communication with other female musicians.": "Emily",
  "The dynamic drives of modern economic growth, in the countries that entered the process ahead of others, meant a reaching out geographically; and the sequential spread of the process, facilitated by major changes in transport and communication, meant a continuous expansion to the less developed areas.": "Simon",
  "My grandmother died in 1991 and I was born in '86. We only met once, but I didn't speak English and she didn't speak Spanish - so we had a communication problem.": "Oona",
  "Continuing on my theme of backing inclusive innovations, I am optimistic of the success of Uniphore. Man-machine communication is one of the more complex problems to solve. Uniphore's vision lends possibility of finding a solution to this very difficult problem, and the company has already made substantial progress.": "Kris",
  "The knowledge we have of communication among cells does not permit my giving you a sophisticated understanding.": "Paul",
  "I try not to put messages in my songs. My only message is man's communication with his fellow man. I want to narrow the gap of strangeness and alienation.": "Rod",
  "Illiteracy is rampant. People are out of communication.": "Karen",
  "Strange about parents. We have such easy access to them and such daunting problems of communication.": "James",
  "If you judge everything by how photographically real it looks, then you're missing out on a lot of what art is about and what communication is. There are ambiguities in life, and that should be reflected in art, cinema, and storytelling, I think.": "Ben",
  "Normally, in the presence of radiation, communication links fail. But with autonomous robots, you don't need communications.": "Vijay",
  "I like to read, especially nonfiction. I love learning, so I study languages, cook, learn basic HTML, and enjoy other activities that stimulate communication and the dark recesses of my musician's brain.": "Joshua",
  "GPS is expensive because it is a very slow communication channel - you need to communicate with three or four satellites for an extended duration at 50 bits per second.": "Robert",
  "Why do only the Latin script when Nokia has a billion consumers? Typography is the bedrock of communication it can really connect people. ": "Bruno",
  "Humans are a social species more than any other, and in order to build a community, which for some reason humans have to do in order to live, we have to solve the communication problem. Language is the tool that was invented to solve that problem.": "Daniel",
  "Every month I do a webcast for 55,000 people, and it's a great tool, great communication vehicle.": "Terry",
  "The education process is moving beyond the traditional classroom/lecture setting. More and more teachers are seeking tools and techniques to engage their classes and enrich their lessons. Video calling is one of these tools, as it removes barriers to communication and lets students move beyond the boundaries of their classrooms.": "Tony",
  "Microsoft is committed to the ubiquity of the Skype experience - communication across every device and every platform will remain a primary focus.": "Tony",
  "Facebook is massive in scale and scope. Twitter is a public communication forum, but if I'm following you, you're not necessarily following me. LinkedIn is, simply, a professional network.": "Jeff",
  "It is difficult to imagine how any behavior in the presence of another person can avoid being a communication of one's own view of the nature of one's relationship with that person and how it can fail to influence that person.": "Paul",
  "The interest in the supernatural in a very generic sense and in the spiritual is not in itself a factor that helps the communication of the Christian faith.": "Karl",
  "It's like there are all these languages available, especially in terms of image. Why confine yourself to only English? There's all these languages and possibilities and concepts to speak or communicate with.": "William",
  "As soon as you judge communication a little more rigorously, there is a possibility that the message will not be democratized. I have to say what I believe to be right. I have to spread out the statement among all the means of expression available to us at present.": "Alexander",
  "On occasion, I like to reread my grandfather's letters. While leafing through them, I'm saddened by what is being lost in modern communication. Soul-baring sentimentality isn't typically poured into text messages, tweets and emails. All too often, personal connections are brushed aside for the sake of convenience in a fast-paced world.": "Kristina",
  "We intend to keep the lines of communication open with the Defense Department so we can help our border law enforcement agencies navigate the equipment application process.": "Henry",
  "I don't tweet. I prefer face-to-face communication and sometimes Instagram.": "Elizabeth",
  "It's near impossible to always be right when you're innovating. It's easy to get emotionally invested in it, but you need to monitor its impact like a hawk and react if you don't like what you see. And if/when you pull it back, you want to do that communication with transparency and humility.": "Jeff",
  "I have always been attracted to apostrophe, perhaps because of its resemblance to prayer. A voice reaches out to something beyond itself that cannot answer it. I find that moving in part because it enacts what is true of all address and communication on some level - it cannot fully be heard, understood, or answered.": "Mary",
  "You know, my dad wasn't a photographer or filmmaker by profession, but on Sundays, he would take pictures of me and my family or his pals horseback riding, and it was a means of communication and affection, a means of not being so dysfunctional with each other.": "Bruce",
  "You used to be able to just call people. You didn't have to be on someone's calendar to have a phone conversation. The telephone was an important and valuable domain of communication, both for casual, friendly chats and for professional exchanges of ideas and information. But no more.": "Dan",
  "It has been said that love is a function of communication. I believe that to be true. I believe, by extension, that human understanding is a function of communication. And the better human beings understand one another, the higher the level of functioning.": "Dan",
  "Even though I was manically overachieving and involved in everything, I still never felt like I belonged. That's definitely affected my whole life and why I wanted to become an actor and tell people stories, because communication and feeling like you belong is such an integral part of our social fabric.": "Penelope",
  "Politics have been changed forever because of people. The Internet is one of the tools that has helped. And it isn't just politics. The new networked dynamics that are now possible with these new forms of communication are also changing the way people engage as consumers that demand more social value from corporations.": "Jeremy",
  "My drawing, like that of most cartoonists, is intended first of all to be functional: to create believable space and communicate information. My strongest point in drawing has always been my ability to show characters' nonverbal communication through facial expression and posture.": "Jessica",
  "Language is memory and metaphor.": "Storm",
  "Words are also seeds, and when dropped into the invisible spiritual substance, they grow and bring forth after their kind.": "Charles",
  "If listeners aren't carried away to Heaven, I'm failing.": "La",
  "Without television and mass communication, that knowledge wouldn't exist. So I think it actually has the possibility of turning people into more understanding and more empathetic people.": "John",
  "I have seen that technology has contributed to improved communication, that it's contributed to better health care, that it's contributed to better food supplies, that it has contributed to all the basic human needs.": "John",
  "The biggest lesson I've learned by living abroad for the last four years is the importance of communication.": "Hidetoshi",
  "My approach is so simple; every song I sing, every story I tell, every move I make, must move the audience to laughter, tears, or inspiration. Otherwise, why do it? It's the communication.": "John",
  "Just open, honest communication is the best thing in the world.": "Brett",
  "I am fourth-generation deaf, which means everyone in my immediate family is deaf. So I grew up always having 100 percent accessibility to language and communication, which was wonderful and something so many deaf people don't have.": "Shoshannah",
  "Mental communication without verbalization... all space is made up of waves and we are constantly sending and receiving messages from our brain.": "Tina",
  "All poetry has to do is to make a strong communication. All the poet has to do is listen. The poet is not an important fellow. There will also be another poet.": "Stevie",
  "I work on OpenBSD fulltime, as the project leader. I set some directions, increase communication between the developers, and try to be involved in nearly every aspect of the base system.": "Theo",
  "I am oblique; I think that has to do with my own nature. I like trying to do things which work on many levels, because I think it is terribly important to give an audience a lot of things they might not get as well as those they will, so that finally the film does take on a texture and is not just simplistic communication.": "Alan",
  "Through basic science literacy, people can understand the policy choices we need to be making. Scientists are not necessarily the greatest communicators, but science and communication is one of the fundamentals we need to address. People are interested.": "James",
  "Sometimes there is a greater lack of communication in facile talking than in silence.": "Faith",
  "The first legislation that I produced relating to the Internet was a bill to overturn a restriction inside of the law that prohibited the Internet backbone from being used for anything other than research and scientific and educational communication.": "Rick",
  "Communication is very important. And the arts do that, whether it's film or theater.": "Anne",
  "I'm interested in the murky areas where there are no clear answers - or sometimes multiple answers. It's here that I try to imagine patterns or codes to make sense of the unknowns that keep us up at night. I'm also interested in the invisible space between people in communication the space guided by translation and misinterpretation. ": "Taryn",
  "To devise an information processing system capable of getting along on its own - it must handle its own problems of programming, bookkeeping, communication and coordination with its users. It must appear to its users as a single, integrated personality.": "Cliff",
  "Tim and Fritz Lang I loved working with. Not Hitchcock so much. There was no communication.": "Sylvia",
  "When you stop talking, you've lost your customer. When you turn your back, you've lost her.": "Estee",
  "But communication is two-sided - vital and profound communication makes demands also on those who are to receive it... demands in the sense of concentration, of genuine effort to receive what is being communicated.": "Roger",
  "In 1984, I turned to theater in the hopes of finding a more direct form of communication between me and my people.": "Cherrie",
  "I've always thought of writing as sort of active communication.": "Lily",
  "I'm in the role of helping these apes negotiate the human role. I'm just a temporary intermediary in what I think will be eventual communication between the two species.": "Sue",
  "But picketing - picketing for or against something, and handing out literature - these are conspicuously formal actions. They have to be understood as indirect communication.": "Tony",
  "Art must unquestionably have a social value; that is, as a potential means of communication it must be addressed, and in comprehensible terms, to the understanding of mankind.": "Rockwell",
  "Success is where preparation and opportunity meet.": "Bobby",
  "Football is football and talent is talent. But the mindset of your team makes all the difference.": "Robert",
  "Every day is a new opportunity. You can build on yesterday's success or put its failures behind and start over again. That's the way life is, with a new game every day, and that's the way baseball is.": "Bob",
  "Just play. Have fun. Enjoy the game.": "Michael",
  "Winners never quit and quitters never win.": "Vince",
  "Sports teaches you character, it teaches you to play by the rules, it teaches you to know what it feels like to win and lose-it teaches you about life.": "Billie",
  "You can't put a limit on anything. The more you dream, the farther you get.": "Michael",
  "The way a team plays as a whole determines its success. You may have the greatest bunch of individual stars in the world, but if they don't play together, the club won't be worth a dime.": "Babe",
  "There's three things men always talk about - women, sports, and cars.": "Mario",
  "You can't win unless you learn how to lose.": "Kareem",
  "Finding good players is easy. Getting them to play as a team is another story.": "Casey",
  "A good vacation for me is going to warm weather. Being able to go outside, in the sun, hit the beach, play outside sports. Being active outside. Going swimming, hanging by the pool, having a couple drinks, having a couple of your close buddies around, and just having a blast.": "Rob",
  "Adversity causes some men to break others to break records. ": "William",
  "Winning is habit. Unfortunately, so is losing.": "Vince",
  "It's just a job. Grass grows, birds fly, waves pound the sand. I beat people up.": "Muhammad",
  "Sports teaches you to understand the meaning of a team. You need to be able to work with everybody you don't have to be their best friend. You can experience the fun of competition and driving toward a common goal without pushing to bond in some major way with each individual on a project. ": "Kathleen",
  "It is not up to me whether I win or lose. Ultimately, this might not be my day. And it is that philosophy towards sports, something that I really truly live by. I am emotional. I want to win. I am hungry. I am a competitor. I have that fire. But deep down, I truly enjoy the art of competing so much more than the result.": "Apolo",
  "Baseball was, is and always will be to me the best game in the world.": "Babe",
  "Band members have a special bond. A great band is more than just some people working together. It's like a highly specialized army unit, or a winning sports team. A unique combination of elements that becomes stronger together than apart.": "Steven",
  "When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.": "Hunter",
  "Sports are such a great teacher. I think of everything they've taught me: camaraderie, humility, how to resolve differences.": "Kobe",
  "That's one thing you learn in sports. You don't give up you fight to the finish. ": "Louis",
  "Do you know what my favorite part of the game is? The opportunity to play.": "Mike",
  "Just be patient. Let the game come to you. Don't rush. Be quick, but don't hurry.": "Earl",
  "The best kids are going to become the best. But the best thing about it is that you're going to learn lessons in playing those sports about winning and losing and teamwork and teammates and arguments and everything else that are going to affect you positively for the rest of your life.": "Carl",
  "Sports is the common denominator in the world that brings everyone together. If there's any one place in the world where there is equality, it is probably sports. That was something that didn't always exist. We've come a long way in sports. Why can't society use sports as a way to bring people together and create change?": "Stephen",
  "At school I pretended I had a normal life, but I felt lonely all the time and different from everyone else. I never felt like I fit in, and I wasn't allowed to participate in after-school activities, go to sports events or parties or date boys. Many times I had to make up stories about why I couldn't do anything with my classmates.": "Joyce",
  "I am in the fighting game. I don't care about anything else. I don't watch the news, I don't care about politics, I don't care about other sports. I don't care about anything I don't need to care about. This is my sport: it is my life. I study it; I think about it all the time. Nothing else matters.": "Conor",
  "To find a man's true character, play golf with him.": "P.",
  "One man practicing sportsmanship is far better than a hundred teaching it.": "Knute",
  "The world of sports knows no religious, racial or political differences. Athletes, from whatever land they come, speak the same language. The lessons of competition are lessons for life.": "Robert",
  "Fishing is much more than fish. It is the great occasion when we may return to the fine simplicity of our forefathers.": "Herbert",
  "Show me a good loser, and I'll show you a loser.": "Vince",
  "People ask me what I do in winter when there's no baseball. I'll tell you what I do. I stare out the window and wait for spring.": "Rogers",
  "I think what endurance sports teach you is to stay dedicated, stay focused, and also to understand you're going to have ups and downs, but you need to keep running right through them.": "Kyrsten",
  "We didn't lose the game we just ran out of time. ": "Vince",
  "You don't play against opponents, you play against the game of basketball.": "Bobby",
  "You wouldn't have won if we'd beaten you.": "Yogi",
  "It's good sportsmanship to not pick up lost golf balls while they are still rolling.": "Mark",
  "Skiing combines outdoor fun with knocking down trees with your face.": "Dave",
  "My motto was always to keep swinging. Whether I was in a slump or feeling badly or having trouble off the field, the only thing to do was keep swinging.": "Hank",
  "Sports is a metaphor for overcoming obstacles and achieving against great odds. Athletes, in times of difficulty, can be important role models.": "Bill",
  "I see great things in baseball. It's our game - the American game.": "Walt",
  "Thanks to the competence, love of God, our country's security and stability, endowed wealth, integrated infrastructure and quality services, the U.A.E. turned into the world's renowned destination for tourism, investment and business management: the interface of choice for hosting major cultural events, artistic and sports, in the world.": "Khalifa",
  "To me, it doesn't matter how good you are. Sport is all about playing and competing. Whatever you do in cricket and in sport, enjoy it, be positive and try to win.": "Ian",
  "The two most important things in life are good friends and a strong bullpen.": "Bob",
  "There are only two seasons - winter and Baseball.": "Bill",
  "Baseball is the only field of endeavor where a man can succeed three times out of ten and be considered a good performer.": "Ted",
  "All of the sports have a safety net, but boxing is the only sport that has none. So when the fighter is through, he is through. While he was fighting his management was very excited for him, but now that he is done, that management team is moving on.": "Gerry",
  "Reverse every natural instinct and do the opposite of what you are inclined to do, and you will probably come very close to having a perfect golf swing.": "Ben",
  "Gray skies are just clouds passing over.": "Frank",
  "Tennis is a perfect combination of violent action taking place in an atmosphere of total tranquillity.": "Billie",
  "I want to rip out his heart and feed it to Lennox Lewis. I want to kill people. I want to rip their stomachs out and eat their children.": "Mike",
  "Good ideas are like Nike sports shoes. They may facilitate success for an athlete who possesses them, but on their own they are nothing but an overpriced pair of sneakers. Sports shoes don't win races. Athletes do.": "Felix",
  "Being nerdy just means being passionate about something, including everyone - the coolest people on Earth are passionate and therefore nerdy about something whatever it is, whether it's sports, or gaming, or technology, or fashion, or beauty, or food, or whatever.": "Zachary",
  "I never really paid attention to sports, which, coming from the mecca of football in Texas, is kind of odd. I played sports, but I was nerdy. Having a single mother, the pressure was on me to get good grades and a scholarship and go to college.": "Sarah",
  "I live by 'Go big or go home.' That's with everything. It's like either commit and go for it or don't do it at all. I apply that to everything. I apply that to relationships, I apply that to like sports, I apply that to everything. That's what I live by. That's how I like it.": "Paul",
  "I think exercise tests us in so many ways, our skills, our hearts, our ability to bounce back after setbacks. This is the inner beauty of sports and competition, and it can serve us all well as adult athletes.": "Peggy",
  "I'm one of these people that likes adrenaline and new things, like extreme sports. It makes me feel alive.": "Gisele",
  "Sailing a boat calls for quick action, a blending of feeling with the wind and water as well as with the very heart and soul of the boat itself. Sailing teaches alertness and courage, and gives in return a joyousness and peace that but few sports afford.": "George",
  "I won't predict anything historic. But nothing is impossible.": "Michael",
  "You'll be dedicated and that's what you should want to be in anything in life - whether it's sports or academics or your relationship. It all stems from finding that fun, that thrill, that excitement.": "Brandi",
  "I learned early in sports that to be effective - for a player to play the best he can play - is a matter of concentration and being unaware of distractions, positive or negative.": "Tom",
  "Pro wrestling is not fake; it's sports entertainment. We go out there and we perform, and a lot of what we do out there is real, but we're not going to insult anyone's intelligence - there is a predetermined winner. It's just the fans don't know who it is, and that's what makes it so intriguing.": "Kurt",
  "If it doesn't matter who wins or loses, then why do they keep score?": "Vince",
  "Sports play a very important role in consolidating the national strength, adding lustre to the country's prestige and honour, inspiring people with national dignity and pride, and imbuing the whole society with revolutionary mettle.": "Kim",
  "I've never met anybody who says they don't like the World Cup. If you're a soccer fan or not, everybody loves watching it, and I think it could be the same for other sports.": "Landon",
  "Sports should not become routine. It should be about passion.": "Kapil",
  "If you watch a game, it's fun. If you play it, it's recreation. If you work at it, it's golf.": "Bob",
  "I wish I had played team sports. I think every kid should. Teamwork builds character - teaches people about leadership and cooperation.": "Mo",
  "But sports carried me away from being in a gang, or being associated with drugs. Sports was my way out.": "LeBron",
  "Life wasn't easy growing up; it was frustrating. If I had been a better reader, then that would have come easily, sports would have come easily, everything would have come easily, and I never would have realized that the way you get ahead in life is hard work.": "Caitlyn",
  "Life is about timing.": "Carl",
  "In sports, you simply aren't considered a real champion until you have defended your title successfully. Winning it once can be a fluke; winning it twice proves you are the best.": "Althea",
  "Don't force your kids into sports. I never was. To this day, my dad has never asked me to go play golf. I ask him. It's the child's desire to play that matters, not the parent's desire to have the child play. Fun. Keep it fun.": "Tiger",
  "I love eating it - grilled chicken, pasta, rice, and other foods that give me long term energy. Every once in a while, my sweet tooth gets the best of me and I have to snack on some candy. Beverage wise, I stick to sports drinks, water, milk, and juice.": "Derrick",
  "I think that from the time you start playing sports as a child you see that your responsibility to your team is to play the best that you can play as an individual... and yet, not take anything away from being part of a team.": "Wayne",
  "The game of golf would lose a great deal if croquet mallets and billiard cues were allowed on the putting green.": "Ernest",
  "Video games offer violent messages, and even the sports video games include taunting and teasing.": "Geoffrey",
  "For many sports fans, the onset of fall only means one thing: It's football season!": "Marcus",
  "When launching a product called an Energy Drink and named Red Bull, a product that stimulates body and mind, it is a short step to the roots where Red Bull came from. We have been doing this for 20 years - now it's called adventure sports, extreme sports, and outdoor sports.": "Dietrich",
  "All of my free time is made up of motor sports endeavors, be them motorcycles or off-road racing or track days. I just love anything with an engine. That is one of my main loves. Obviously, my other well-known love is Kristen Bell.": "Dax",
  "You always get a special kick on opening day, no matter how many you go through. You look forward to it like a birthday party when you're a kid. You think something wonderful is going to happen.": "Joe",
  "Contrary to the royal and uptight image of polo, I want to bring it to a younger generation. This is a great sport that can have a larger audience and appeal to more people. Sportsmanship is lacking in many other sports that I don't want to name.": "Randeep",
  "Apart from education, you need good health, and for that, you need to play sports.": "Kapil",
  "I'm a football fan, a sports fan, a fan of competition.": "Matthew",
  "These are my new shoes. They're good shoes. They won't make you rich like me, they won't make you rebound like me, they definitely won't make you handsome like me. They'll only make you have shoes like me. That's it.": "Charles",
  "Sports are a microcosm of society.": "Billie",
  "The team has come along slow but fast.": "Casey",
  "We are raising today's children in sterile, risk-averse and highly structured environments. In so doing, we are failing to cultivate artists, pioneers and entrepreneurs, and instead cultivating a generation of children who can follow the rules in organized sports games, sit for hours in front of screens and mark bubbles on standardized tests.": "Darell",
  "I want to explore the world properly, to be able to write about and take pictures of all kinds of different cultures. Just be an explorer or adventurer. I also love extreme sports.": "Cara",
  "There are two things that come very easily to me: rooting for New York sports teams and making mistakes.": "Harvey",
  "Some people are born on third base and go through life thinking they hit a triple.": "Barry",
  "Wrestling is ballet with violence.": "Jesse",
  "You spend a good piece of your life gripping a baseball and in the end it turns out that it was the other way around all the time.": "Jim",
  "Bulls do not win bull fights. People do.": "Norman",
  "Golf is a game in which you yell 'fore,' shoot six, and write down five.": "Paul",
  "I don't want to play golf. When I hit a ball, I want someone else to go chase it.": "Rogers",
  "I guess there is nothing that will get your mind off everything like golf. I have never been depressed enough to take up the game, but they say you get so sore at yourself you forget to hate your enemies.": "Will",
  "People love video games because they do things they obviously can't do in real life. That's especially true with sports games because fans love to step into the shoes of their favorite athletes.": "Ralph",
  "Regardless of the obstacles or hurdles that are ahead of you, regardless of the opponent, regardless of the odds, your goal and objective always is to win. I think that's part of sports.": "Grant",
  "I grew up on the East Coast, and we always used to say, 'Go get your hustle on,' whether it was playing sports or making money. You do what you have to do to do what you want to do.": "Antoine",
  "I'm a visual thinker, really bad at algebra. There's others that are a pattern thinker. These are the music and math minds. They think in patterns instead of pictures. Then there's another type that's not a visual thinker at all, and they're the ones that memorize all of the sports statistics, all of the weather statistics.": "Temple",
  "One afternoon when I was 9, my dad told me I'd be skipping school the next day. Then we drove 12 hours from Melbourne to Sydney for the Centenary Test, a once-in-a-lifetime commemorative cricket match. It was great fun - especially for a kid who was a massive sports fan.": "Hugh",
  "Bowling is all physics and energy distribution. It's F = ma. So it is actually one of the most science-y sports, because it literally is just a ball and a surface and objects to knock down.": "Chris",
  "Trip Hawkins - and this was the early 1980s - was saying there's going to be a day when everyone has a computer and they're going to want to do more on it, including playing games. So he started up a company, EA Sports, and he was going to have three games, football, basketball and baseball. So I was the football game.": "John",
  "It's a crazy world, so sports and athletics and music can be a form of escapism.": "Eddie",
  "I've gotten to know a lot of great people here in all the different sports. It's fun. It's fun to get involved where you live. And this is where I live. I'm a registered voter here. I have my Wisconsin driver's license.": "Aaron",
  "I'm 19 now, and I go to The New School in New York, where I study Criminal Psychology. My first week of second semester was during Fashion Week when my first editorials in 'CR Fashion Book' and 'Sports Illustrated' came out. It was crazy!": "Gigi",
  "The ban on sports betting does exactly what Prohibition did. It makes criminals rich.": "James",
  "I'm a girl, but that doesn't mean I don't appreciate greatness and the struggle of sports. My situation - and I've always said this, even in politics - is may the best man win. I'm not team-bound.": "Diane",
  "If I wasn't dyslexic, I probably wouldn't have won the Games. If I had been a better reader, then that would have come easily, sports would have come easily... and I never would have realized that the way you get ahead in life is hard work.": "Caitlyn",
  "If you look at things that really affect people's lives - sport, the arts, charities - they were always at the back of the queue for government money - health, social security, defence, pensions were all way ahead. And each of those areas - sports, the arts, the lottery - got relatively petty cash from the government.": "John",
  "How does one control weight? By not overeating. How does one stay in shape? One plays sports. There are no magic pills here.": "Vladimir",
  "Since childhood, sports has been one of the most important influences in my life.": "Lindsey",
  "I'm a pretty agile guy, especially being taller and having done martial arts from about the age of 13, but parkour is one of those sports that I wish I'd discovered sooner. When my nephew first showed me, I thought, 'Damn - I'm too old for this.'": "Paul",
  "Though teenagers are generally very interested in sports, they must realise that education is the most important thing in their lives. They must find the right balance.": "Kapil",
  "The great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, putting forward the development of sports as a matter that has an important bearing on the prosperity of the country and nation, indicated the road ahead of the Juche-based sports and wrote a new chapter in the history of building a sports power by dint of outstanding ideas and leadership.": "Kim",
  "I'm a big sports fan. Football. Cricket.": "Danny",
  "Pro football is like nuclear warfare. There are no winners, only survivors.": "Frank",
  "Trying to sneak a fastball past Hank Aaron is like trying to sneak the sunrise past a rooster.": "Joe",
  "I used to play sports. Then I realized you can buy trophies. Now I am good at everything.": "Demetri",
  "Sports is like rock 'n' roll. Both are dominant cultural forces, both speak an international language, and both are all about emotions.": "Phil",
  "Honestly, I don't listen to nobody else's music but my own. It's kind of like sports to me. You don't see Kobe Bryant at a LeBron James game - he just works on his own game. And that's what I do. I only listen to me, so I can criticize and analyze and all those things.": "Lil",
  "If you're a sports fan you realize that when you meet somebody, like a girlfriend, they kind of have to root for your team. They don't have a choice.": "Jimmy",
  "In the seventies we had to make it acceptable for people to accept girls and women as athletes. We had to make it okay for them to be active. Those were much scarier times for females in sports.": "Billie",
  "I grew up with six brothers, and I'm from Chicago, so princesses and Barbie dolls were not around the house. It was more like sports and comic books, so getting to work for Marvel is like my version of being able to be a princess.": "Chloe",
  "Sports, entertainment and aviation are three of the most exciting professions in the world; you are dealing with the same magnitude.": "John",
  "If I was invincible, maybe I would take up some extreme sports.": "Tom",
  "Relax? How can anybody relax and play golf? You have to grip the club, don't you?": "Ben",
  "The only time my prayers are never answered is on the golf course.": "Billy",
  "You win some, lose some, and wreck some.": "Dale",
  "Baseball is a game where a curve is an optical illusion, a screwball can be a pitch or a person, stealing is legal and you can spit anywhere you like except in the umpire's eye or on the ball.": "James",
  "As athletes, we're used to reacting quickly. Here, it's 'come, stop, come, stop.' There's a lot of downtime. That's the toughest part of the day.": "Michael",
  "I'm tired of hearing about money, money, money, money, money. I just want to play the game, drink Pepsi, wear Reebok.": "Shaquille",
  "Play is the only way the highest intelligence of humankind can unfold.": "Joseph",
  "You don't suffer, kill yourself and take the risks I take just for money. I love bike racing.": "Greg",
  "Any time Detroit scores more than 100 points and holds the other team below 100 points they almost always win.": "Doug",
  "Football is a simple game. Twenty-two men chase a ball for 90 minutes and at the end, the Germans always win.": "Gary",
  "You know how sports teach kids teamwork and how to be strong and brave and confident? Improv was my sport. I learned how to not waffle and how to hold a conversation, how to take risks and actually be excited to fail.": "Emma",
  "I have long recognized a link between fitness and mental health and I think we need to encourage young people to take part in sports and team activities because we know it has such positive results.": "Tipper",
  "Sports have always been a really important part of how I energize myself, as well as how I relax. I spend a lot of my spare time with my family playing tennis, biking and rollerblading.": "Irene",
  "I used to practice at the hockey ground on synthetic surface while I was in the sports hostel, so Test cricket is certainly going to be a challenge for me.": "Suresh",
  "Every child should have time for arts, music, sports, drama, robotics, school newspapers and the like, not to mention recess and play.": "Chris",
  "We wanted Nike to be the world's best sports and fitness company. Once you say that, you have a focus. You don't end up making wing tips or sponsoring the next Rolling Stones world tour.": "Phil",
  "I love extreme sports, I like snowboarding and motorcross and rollerblading and hockey.": "Jeremy",
  "Tiger Woods is the only sports star who's worth every penny he makes.": "Mark",
  "It's kind of ironic that the two sports with the greatest characters, boxing and horse racing, have both been on the decline. In both cases it's for the lack of a suitable hero.": "Dick",
  "The Games are just a nice, positive way to build friendships, camaraderie and, of course, self-esteem. Plus, the Games are a great opportunity for people to participate in sports who normally wouldn't.": "Greg",
  "The word 'geek' today does not mean what it used to mean. A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.": "Olivia",
  "The most important thing you learn as a sports photographer is anticipation - not where the action is taking place, but where it's going to take place. Not where the subject is now, but where they're going to be.": "Lawrence",
  "Meeting sports athletes that are the best in the world is a thrill to this day.": "Phil",
  "I like sports, and swimming is my favorite. Doing physical exercises keeps one fit and healthy and helps one work more efficiently. I think we all need to strike a balance between work and relaxation. This can keep us energetic and help us do our job better.": "Xi",
  "In the United States, we spend millions of dollars on sports because it promotes teamwork, discipline, and the experience of learning to make great progress in small increments. Learning to play music does all this and more.": "Linda",
  "As a father, I believe that involving children in sports at a young age is generally, a wise proposition. I believe that healthy competition is... well... healthy; that sporting events foster a spirit of teamwork that far surpasses the events themselves; and that active participation keeps children moving and is good for their self-esteem.": "Naveen",
  "Bin Laden wasn't all that central to the terrorist network any more, but taking him down created a kind of national catharsis. It's been a really, really long time since we had something to celebrate that didn't involve a sports team. I'd rather it had been a non-death-related occasion, but we'll take what we can get.": "Gail",
  "I'm a golfer, and what are the two sports you can do till you drop? Golf and surfing. They're great for you limber-wise, they're great for you health-wise, and they put you in sweet locations.": "Matthew",
  "When I get into a bad mood, I do sports and then everything's OK. And then I go and make decisions, however painful they may be.": "Dmitry",
  "Psychology is much bigger than just medicine, or fixing unhealthy things. It's about education, work, marriage - it's even about sports. What I want to do is see psychologists working to help people build strengths in all these domains.": "Martin",
  "Nobody wants to buy a $60,000 electric Civic. But people will pay $90,000 for an electric sports car.": "Elon",
  "I like sports. I'm a big football fan. When I was a kid, I was a... I don't even know how to describe it... I was an obsessed Brooklyn Dodgers fan. And I think when they left Brooklyn, which was simultaneous with me starting college, everything changed, and I haven't had the same passion for sports.": "Brian",
  "I was all-state in four sports in New Jersey, but sometimes I couldn't get served at a restaurant two blocks from my high school. There were no job opportunities then... the only thing a black youth could aspire to be was a bellboy or a pullman or an elevator operator, or, maybe, a teacher. There was a time when all we had was black baseball.": "Monte",
  "I think my appeal is that I've always tried to stay very grounded to my fans and to be accessible - not being this unattainable thing. I think doing sports and riding motorcycles has made me more approachable and more real and down to earth.": "Marisa",
  "Bringing more large sporting events to Africa would help the continent develop sports policies and at the same time optimize its peoples' chances of achieving competitive success.": "Richard",
  "Science has taught us, against all intuition, that apparently solid things like crystals and rocks are really almost entirely composed of empty space. And the familiar illustration is the nucleus of an atom is a fly in the middle of a sports stadium, and the next atom is in the next sports stadium.": "Richard",
  "I am just enjoying what cricket has given me. In sports, it's obviously really important for all of us to remain fit - and health is wealth, so health comes with the sport.": "Harbhajan",
  "Lake Pend Oreille is definitely my favorite place to be while in Sandpoint. I love to get out on a boat to enjoy water sports, camping, fishing, or just to relax and catch a sunset.": "Nate",
  "In sports, every day you can be the hero or the goat.": "Geoff",
  "For watching sports, I tend to drink Guinness; early evenings always begin well with a Grey Goose and tonic with plenty of lime; and on a cold winter's night, there's nothing quite like a glass of Black Maple Hill... an absolute peach of a bourbon.": "Martin",
  "Like great teams in sports and business endeavors, if there's a chemistry among the participants, and they truly enjoy fellowship together, everybody wants to be there, stay involved, and just have fun together.": "Ed",
  "Sports gives us the grandest opportunity of all to talk about reaching down and helping up or getting on somebody else's shoulders.": "Jerry",
  "I paid more for the Dallas Cowboys than anyone prior than that had ever paid to get involved in sports. But I wanted to be a part of the future of the Dallas Cowboys.": "Jerry",
  "Equality for men and women, across the world, not only in sports, is the goal. We obviously have a long way to go, but every little bit helps.": "Venus",
  "Sports are a great place to show that equality can happen.": "Venus",
  "I know that some of the finest writing I've ever read has been sports writing, whatever the topic was, whatever the sport they were writing about. It seems to be an area where people are allowed a little more leeway than when they're reporting on traffic jams and city-council meetings.": "Katherine",
  "Sports uplift us. It's celebratory, gives us optimism and joy.": "Travis",
  "I think it's huge, especially in team sports, for players to be able to rely on each other and to really trust in each other.": "Alex",
  "I've told Billy if I ever caught him cheating, I wouldn't kill him because I love his children and they need a dad. But I would beat him up. I know where all of his sports injuries are.": "Angelina",
  "We're not doing outrageous fashion; I make sports clothes that are relatively conservative, clothes that everyone wears.": "Calvin",
  "I wasn't really a work-conscious type of person. I was a player. I loved to play sports.": "Michael",
  "There are kids who get on a BMX bike when they're eight years old and they go, 'Whoa, this is incredible,' and grow up to do extreme sports. It's the same for me with acting.": "Joaquin",
  "I think the Cowboys are one of only two teams in all of sports that engender love and hate to that extreme. The other is the Yankees. You love the Yankees or you hate the Yankees.": "Al",
  "I'm excited to join my brother-in-law Ken Thomson every Tuesday night on SiriusXM to recap all of the awesome NFL action, and to find out what in the Wylde world of sports is going on.": "Zakk",
  "Eventually you won't think of 'the Internet business.' You'll think of it more like news, weather, sports, but even that taxonomy isn't clear.": "Bill",
  "Some of the companies we helped start are names you know. An office supply company called Staples - where I'm pleased to see the Obama campaign has been shopping; The Sports Authority, which became a favorite of my sons. We started an early childhood learning center called Bright Horizons that First Lady Michelle Obama rightly praised.": "Mitt",
  "I used to play a lot of racket sports, tennis and squash.": "Jason",
  "I come from a family that has always emphasized and enjoyed sports - golf, tennis, football, baseball and the rest.": "Robert",
  "I don't know anything that builds the will to win better than competitive sports.": "Richard",
  "You cannot mix sports with politics.": "Jackie",
  "I was brought up to believe that it's family first. Of all the people my parents knew, the family was most important. You always turn to your family, and the family supports you. We do what we can to support our young and go and see the grandchildren if they're doing plays at school and their sports events.": "Mary",
  "Some people go off to an ashram or they, you know, have a midlife crisis and buy a sports car. For me, I do 'Hedwig,' and I see it's a midlife crisis maybe, and I see what's next. And it's a good trampoline, maybe, into the next part of my life.": "John",
  "All the minor sports injuries you acquire over the years begin to multiply like flies when you get over 70.": "Peter",
  "Great performers - in sports, the arts, business, or whatever field - have undertaken massive amounts of training. And when that training is complete... they train some more, and harder than they expect to perform. Why? Training builds confidence and ensures peak performance.": "Brandon",
  "I'm not into extreme sports or something. I just live a quiet life.": "Charlie",
  "I've been playing sports since I was five. For me, there's no happier moment than when I'm out in the woods on a bike or a run. I feel on top of the world, and nothing else makes me feel that way.": "Daniel",
  "Discrimination and prejudice of any kind have no place in sports or in our society.": "Jerry",
  "Golf is a day spent in a round of strenuous idleness.": "William",
  "In sports and in business, the greatest leaders are those who make the best decisions in the most crucial of situations. They are the ones who focus their energy on turning tough decisions into winning decisions.": "Don",
  "Everyone thought I was going to die like a year later, they didn't know. So I helped educate sports, and then the world, that a man living with HIV can play basketball. He's not going to give it to anybody by playing basketball.": "Magic",
  "I was socially isolated as a kid. I had friends, but I wasn't very good at sports and that sort of thing so I became quite comfortable being by myself, exploring. The world was my private playground, and in it, I was supreme. Darwin, Faraday, Huxley and other great scientists were my companions.": "Vilayanur",
  "I have never cared especially for outdoor sports and have no desire to excel at tennis, swimming, or golf. I'll leave those things to the men.": "Marilyn",
  "I did everything when I started. In Miami I did news, I did weather, I did sports, I did disk-jockeying. And I did a sports talk show every week - every Saturday night.": "Larry",
  "My favorite was always whichever sport was in season. I think these days it's almost saddening to see kids who are 10 or 11 and are forced to choose one sport and specialize in that sport and play that sport year-round. By playing different sports... you become a better all-around athlete.": "Sam",
  "I know when I have kids, when I'm older, I'm going to encourage them to play sports because I think it teaches you a lot. It teaches you discipline, teamwork, and that there's really no 'I' in team.": "Gregg",
  "I believe God created sports for a good reason. It's recreation. It's something that we enjoy. It teaches us a lot as well... I believe God is a sports fan.": "Luke",
  "In Boston, they love their sports celebrities. And it's great.": "Tom",
  "Every boy learns more in his hours of play than in his hours of labor. In school, he lays in the materials of thinking, but in his sports, he actually thinks: he whets his faculties, and he opens his eyes.": "William",
  "You know it's going to hell when the best rapper out there is white and the best golfer is black.": "Charles",
  "If you think it's hard to meet new people, try picking up the wrong golf ball.": "Jack",
  "Growing up in Huntington Beach, you were either a traditional sports athlete, a skateboarder, or a surfer. I got my first skateboard when I was five and skated off and on over the years, did a little BMX racing as a kid, and then in my freshman or sophomore year I started getting a little bit more into skateboarding.": "Jason",
  "I grew up thinking that I would become a fighter pilot and was fascinated by aircrafts as I had grown up around that. But my father encouraged me to not become an Air Force person, given the varied interests I had, be it books, movies, sports or fighter flying.": "Kapil",
  "A geek isn't the skinny kid with a pocket protector and acne. There can be computer geeks, video game geeks, car geeks, military geeks, and sports geeks. Being a geek just means that you're passionate about something.": "Olivia",
  "Ethnic prejudice has no place in sports, and baseball must recognize that truth if it is to maintain stature as a national game.": "Branch",
  "I think sports are extremely beneficial for our youth. They parallel life in so many ways.": "Kerri",
  "The best thing about the Kentucky Derby is that it is only two minutes long. It is the quickest event in sports, except for Sumo-wrestling & Mike Tyson fights. Maybe Drag-racing is quicker, but I have never been attracted to it.": "Hunter",
  "Sport is a wonderful metaphor for life. Of all the sports that I played - skiing, baseball, fishing - there is no greater example than golf, because you're playing against yourself and nature.": "Robert",
  "Sports is the only entertainment where, no matter how many times you go back, you never know the ending.": "Neil",
  "Baseball is almost the only orderly thing in a very unorderly world. If you get three strikes, even the best lawyer in the world can't get you off.": "Bill",
  "If a lot of people gripped a knife and fork the way they do a golf club, they'd starve to death.": "Sam",
  "I love outdoor sports, like volleyball, and I play them whenever I can.": "Gisele",
  "We live in a world where sports have the potential to bridge the gap between racism, sexism and discrimination. The 2012 Olympic Games was a great start but hopefully what these games taught us is that if women are given an opportunity on an equal playing field the possibilities for women are endless.": "Jackie",
  "Jamaica is more than just the 'brand' the world recognizes so well; it's a place of pride for the people who live here, its educational institutions, its sports achievements, its science and technology growth.": "Portia",
  "Many high school students are under so much competitive pressure. They are sometimes taught that if they don't have a 4.0 GPA, score in the 99th percentile on admissions tests, and demonstrate leadership in sports and participate in clubs, they won't get into college anywhere. Even highly credentialed professionals get caught up in this.": "Elizabeth",
  "The tradition in Serbia has always been team sports - football, basketball, handball, volleyball and water polo, individual sports are not supported.": "Novak",

  "I think extreme sports are really good for relieving stress.": "Dave",
  "In a world as competitive as ours, the child who does not get a decent education is condemned to the fringes of society. I think all Australians agree that this is intolerable. So we must demand as much of our schools as we do of our sports teams - and ensure that they keep the Australian dream alive for every child.": "Rupert",
  "Sports is the toy department of human life.": "Howard",
  "Where there is peace, there is sports; where there is sports, there is peace. Peace is what allows us, especially young people, to dream, go after one's goals and prepare you for the next challenge in life.": "Kim",
  "Boxing is a celebration of the lost religion of masculinity all the more trenchant for its being lost.": "Joyce",
  "Golf is a game in which one endeavors to control a ball with implements ill adapted for the purpose.": "Woodrow",
  "Baseball life is a tough life on the family.": "Nolan",
  "You've got to enjoy time with your family and friends, and if you're involved in sports franchises, those peak moments in playoff games. You have to enjoy life.": "Paul",
  "I just got hooked on the radio, the voice of it all. It was my connection to metropolitan America, if you will. Sports, in particularly baseball then 'cause of its rich sediment of numbers, was one of the first things a young person could peg up with adults on - that is, you could know as much about Jimmy Fox as your father did.": "George",
  "Black people dominate sports in the United States. 20% of the population and 90% of the final four.": "Chris",
  "Talk radio has almost ruined the sports fan.": "Phil",
  "Sports betting is all about money management, so the most money won on one event is not the most important thing.": "Bruce",
  "As a result of Title IX, and a new generation of parents who want their daughters to have the opportunities they never had, women's sports have arrived.": "Sheryl",
  "The things that people do now in sports, you can't even believe. These are complete total athletes. To see what human beings can do in the highest level is amazing.": "Billie",
  "There's a whole lot more to the African-American community than entertainment and sports.": "J.",
  "I learned early on, stay away from politics, stay away from religion and don't talk about sports. Those three right there will get you in trouble.": "Gabriel",
  "Growing up, I looked up to major league baseball players, and now these young women have amazing, incredible women all across the board, from swimming to gymnastics to softball to basketball. It is incredible how far women have come and women in sports have come.": "Jennie",
  "When we talk about reviews, what we are really talking about is just a market report - it's like reading about the new Lexus. You have to know what the guy writing the review cares about to understand his take. Does he like sports cars, or does he like Bentleys?": "Mike",
  "I still feel that in India we look upon sports as a recreational activity - which it is - but people have to understand that there is a career in sports. It's not just necessary to be a doctor or a lawyer or an engineer, as most of us Indians appear to think that our children should grow up to be.": "Abhishek",
  "When I was little, I guess I was just an ordinary kid. But then things changed when I was in junior high. You know, kids that become geeks become one because of something. Like, they aren't good at sports, or girls don't like them. I, too, for some reason, got into things like science fiction and, well, especially science fiction as an escape.": "Takashi",
  "Leadership is one of sports' intangibles. Guys can score, guys can fight, guys can skate faster than anybody else. But not everybody can say, 'Follow me.'": "Paul",
  "I grew up in a very 'Friday Night Lights,' sports-focused town. I did not play the sports. I was never bullied physically, but I was called names. I was also an overweight kid. I knew what it's like to feel like the other, to feel written off for things that were not in my control - my appearance, my interests.": "Robin",
  "The political hero is not like the sports champion or matinee idol or daring inventor; like the war hero, he is born only of tragedy.": "David",
  "To be honest, I'm shocked the University of Washington's sports teams are called the Huskies. Why haven't the Leftists that run this entire state demanded they be renamed the 'Athletes of Size' so as to not fat shame anyone?": "Milo",
  "The diet for climbing all the time isn't really different from the diet for living. It's not like cardio sports where you're burning a bajillion calories every day.": "Alex",
  "Thus so wretched is man that he would weary even without any cause for weariness... and so frivolous is he that, though full of a thousand reasons for weariness, the least thing, such as playing billiards or hitting a ball, is sufficient enough to amuse him.": "Blaise",
  "A lifetime of training for just ten seconds.": "Jesse",
  "Football is violence and cold weather and sex and college rye.": "Roger",
  "I grew up in New York City, where we played highly unorganized sports: stick ball, stoop ball, and the occasional game of baseball with no adult supervision.": "Jeff",
  "It's hard to create new friendships outside sports.": "Tim",
  "It is hard to compete with other sports. Badminton is a sport which, when compared with football and tennis, still needs promotion.": "Lin",
  "After one Olympics, if we invest in sports and say we will get a gold medal in the next Olympic, it doesn't work like that in sports. How it works is that you provide the infrastructure, provide education about nutrition and health.": "Mahendra",
  "There's food and supplements that you can take legally that will better your body and help you stay healthy. Shortcuts are something that's always been around all sports, but as a union, we're trying to do the best we can to weed those guys out of the game.": "Jake",
  "What other people may find in poetry or art museums, I find in the flight of a good drive.": "Arnold",

  "If you drink don't drive. Don't even putt.": "Dean",
  "The only way to prove that you're a good sport is to lose.": "Ernie",
  "He's got an overall flair for the game. It looks to me like he really loves what he does and he can't wait to get up in the morning, go hit some balls and go play.": "Gary",
  "I had pro offers from the Detroit Lions and Green Bay Packers, who were pretty hard up for linemen in those days. If I had gone into professional football the name Jerry Ford might have been a household word today.": "Gerald",
  "I regard golf as an expensive way of playing marbles.": "Gilbert",
  "Eighteen holes of match play will teach you more about your foe than 18 years of dealing with him across a desk.": "Grantland",
  "The triple is the most exciting play in baseball. Home runs win a lot of games, but I never understood why fans are so obsessed with them.": "Hank",
  "Baseball players are smarter than football players. How often do you see a baseball team penalized for too many men on the field?": "Jim",
  "Golf appeals to the idiot in us and the child. Just how childlike golf players become is proven by their frequent inability to count past five.": "John",
  "He hits it long. His shoulders are impressively quick through the ball. That's where he's getting his power from. He's young and has great elasticity.": "Nick",
  "Fans don't boo nobodies.": "Reggie",
  "The difference between the old ballplayer and the new ballplayer is the jersey. The old ballplayer cared about the name on the front. The new ballplayer cares about the name on the back.": "Steve",
  "If a tie is like kissing your sister, losing is like kissing you grandmother with her teeth out.": "George",
  "Many baseball fans look upon an umpire as a sort of necessary evil to the luxury of baseball, like the odor that follows an automobile.": "Christy",
  "All sports for all people.": "Pierre",
  "I'm a competitive person and I love the challenge of mastering new things.": "Sasha",
  "The Olympic Games must not be an end in itself, they must be a means of creating a vast programme of physical education and sports competitions for all young people.": "Avery",
  "I enjoyed being involved in team sports and making close friendships.": "Brian",
  "The American people are sheep. They're comfortable, rich, working. It's like the Romans, they're happy with bread and their spectator sports. The Super Bowl means more to them than any right.": "Jack",
  "The importance that our society attaches to sport is incredible. After all, is football a game or a religion? The people of this country have allowed sports to get completely out of hand.": "Howard",
  "My priority is to turn people - especially kids - on to sports and being active so they don't even have to think about it being good for their health. If people participate for the fun of it, and believe me - it is fun, then fitness programs will be much more successful.": "Alan",
  "I was very fortunate to play sports. All the anger in me went out. I had to do what I had to do. If you stay angry all the time, then you really don't have a good life.": "Willie",
  "The addiction to sports, therefore, in a peculiar degree marks an arrested development in man's moral nature.": "Thorstein",
  "Sports without music, it's nothing but a game. Music adds the emotion.": "Ice",
  "Amateurism is the strongest form of discrimination in sports. Because it discriminates against the underprivileged, it discriminates against the poor. If we want sports to go back to the wealthy, let's make it amateur again.": "Carl",
  "I did all the right things in so many tournaments. But like I said, sometimes in sports it just goes the other way. Maybe you've already won so much that it evens it out a bit sometimes. I don't know.": "Roger",
  "I'm not good at anything except writing jokes. I wasn't good at sports, I wasn't good at anything artsy, ever. I think there was a real worry for a while about what I would be good at. I was just this chubby little Indian kid who looked like a nerd.": "Mindy",
  "That's the biggest gap in sports, the difference between the winner and the loser of the Super Bowl.": "John",
  "Sports and entertainment are the only places where inner-city kids see themselves being able to succeed. Their intellectual development is something they don't relate to.": "Kareem",
  "I've always been really active. I grew up playing sports, so I'm always shooting hoops or throwing the football with my friends. I'm super-active in that sense.": "Taylor",
  "I was focused on athletics, outdoors, sports.": "Joe",
  "I also have a soft spot for spicy chicken wings. They are always best eaten at dives and sports bars, like Wogie's in the West Village, New York City, near my house.": "Gail",
  "I worked at my high school newspaper at Andover, which came out weekly, unusual for a high school paper. Then my first day at Penn I went right to the 'Daily Pennsylvanian' and pretty much spent most of my college career working both as the sports editor and then editor of the editorial page.": "H.",
  "When a sports movie really works, it gets you on all levels, because the stakes are high. It's black and white. It's win or lose.": "Carla",
  "If architecture is, as is sometimes said, music set in concrete, then football and basketball may be said to be creativity embodied in team sports.": "Michael",
  "The BBC sports department when I was there was seriously to the right of Ghengis Khan, and if people think I am strange, they should have met some of the production staff I worked with. Margaret Thatcher and the Queen were the pin up girls for many of them.": "David",
  "Sports fans have been mistreated for a long time. They have overpaid for inferior food and they have had poor service.": "Dave",
  "You know, I never really paid attention to sports, which, coming from the mecca of football in Texas, is kind of odd. I played sports, but I was nerdy. Having a single mother, the pressure was on me to get good grades and a scholarship and go to college.": "Sarah",
  "American sports are quite masculine. And football - although it's still played by men all over the world - football compared to American football is quite feminine in its artistry. And there's no padding. It's America's loss, though.": "Noel",
  "My love for sports will never die. I love martial arts and I want to promote it in whichever way I can. I am a fighter first, then an actor.": "Akshay",
  "Compared to politics, I think sports is funnier, because it's inconsequential. And politics can be real important and all that. The more pointless something is, the funnier it is, you know?": "Norm",
  "Political columnists and sports pundits are rewarded for being overconfident.": "Daniel",
  "My son has taken liking for sports and is most of the time playing cricket and football. It is so much fun being with them, as I'm enjoying every phase of motherhood.": "Karisma",
  "In 1964, when Lee Iacocca said, 'Shelby, I want you to make a sports car out of the Mustang,' the first thing I said was, 'Lee, you can't make a race horse out of a mule. I don't want to do it.' He said, 'I didn't ask you to make it; you work for me.'": "Carroll",
  "I have always maintained that if you work hard, it won't go waste, as recognition will come to you at some stage, whether in studies or sports. You need to have good intentions and intent to move ahead in life as well as in sports.": "Suresh",
  "You always hear that tragedies put sports in perspective, that they prove we shouldn't care this much about the successes and failures of a bunch of wealthy strangers. I'm going the other way - sometimes, sports put everything else in perspective.": "Bill",
  "When I was a little kid growing up in Iceland, I always dreamed about creating something that could have an impact on the whole world, and even as a young boy I was passionate about fitness and sports.": "Magnus",
  "Compared to politics, I think sports is funnier, because it's inconsequential. And politics can be real important and all that. The more pointless something is, the funnier it is, you know? And the more grave or important things are... You know, some comedians can get this disease where they get serious all the time.": "Norm",
  "I've always liked speed. I own a car that I shouldn't be talking about because I'm an environmentalist, but the 1955 Porsche Spyder 550 RS is the finest sports car ever made.": "Robert",
  "I have learned, in my life and work as a sportswriter, that big-time Sports and big-time Politics are not so far apart in America. They are both a means to the same end, which is victory... And why not? Victory is good for you, and don't let anybody tell you different.": "Hunter",
  "Politics should not interfere with sports. And sports should impact politics.": "Vladimir",
  "Everyone thinks I'm this jock of a woman, but I didn't play any sports. I didn't even let my kids play baseball because I was afraid they were going to get hit by balls.": "Patti",
  "Global sports tournaments have a range of benefits that go far beyond the games themselves. They can transform the image of a country or a region. They bring people together and reveal new possibilities to a nation's youth.": "Richard",
  "'Potato-chip news' is news that's repetitive, requires little effort to absorb, and is consumable in massive quantities: true crime, natural disasters, political punditry, celebrity gossip, sports gossip, or endless photographs of beautiful houses, food, or clothes.": "Gretchen",
  "I won't have any competitive instincts in any sports, other than golf. I can't see being competitive in sports any more.": "Michael",
  "J.J. Watt is larger than life and Houston's newest sports hero, in every sense of the word. He is a guy who spends NFL Fridays at high school football games and actively seeks out those in need of his kindness.": "Hannah",
  "Drama is played at the pace of chess... or billiards... or poker. Engrossing? Sure. But comedy is played at the jubilant, high-octane speed of sports like basketball or hockey.": "Mark",
  "Team sports are very important for shaping personalities. It's important that kids understand the mentality behind playing team sports and playing for one another and playing with friends.": "Brian",
  "I grew up a Michael Jordan fan; that was my first idol. But my true sports idol was Deion Sanders: he was the person I always wanted to be. I wanted to play two sports professionally, which would never happen, but to me, that was every kid's dream.": "Tim",
  "Our philosophy is you need to give nonprofit money for health, nutrition, education, culture, and sports.": "Carlos",
  "It's great to listen to men talk about sports or fights or war or even hunting sometimes, but the presence of the other, the presence of art and beauty, which crude masculinity seems to discount, is essential. Real civilization and real manhood seem to me to include those.": "James",
  "I always liked to write and had fun writing, but I didn't have any pretensions about being a writer. I liked to read and liked to putz around and write little stories or poems, but my thing was sports.": "John",
  "When I was younger, I used to bite my nails so bad. I used to play sports; I played, like, every sport. I would be playing soccer, and I'd be in the middle of the field just zoned out, biting my nails, and I'd, like, miss the ball going past me.": "Kendall",
  "For me to be with someone, he's got to be fit. Or at least doing something he loves. Following your passion - whether it's hiking or sports or whatever - is super sexy.": "Kaley",
  "My becoming a film actor was more a twist of tale than a chosen course because I dared not to think I could ever become an actor. I couldn't even walk up on a stage and say 'Thank you' when we were to receive trophies at our sports meets at college.": "Dilip",
  "I never use the word 'hero' in sports. Hero is way above 'star.' I save 'star' for sports. Sports is entertainment that's all it is. ": "Bud",
  "We knew sports was important to us and our family, but there are priorities in life.Obviously, faith is foremost; how we did in school is important. If we didn't handle that business then there were no privileges.": "Stephen",
  "Whatever free time I get, I love to catch news and sports shows.": "Amitabh",
  "I get a lot of letters that say, 'I'm a normal, down-to-earth girl. I love to cook, and I love sports.' What I also get are letters from a whole bunch of moms saying, 'My daughter is awesome,' and, 'My daughter is a great daughter.'": "J.",
  "Cleveland's a great city. I love the city. The people here are awesome. They're loyal and hard-working, and they're loyal to our sports scene, and things are changing here.": "Stipe",
  "Unless you enjoy life passionately, you cannot be a good artiste. Practise what you like, be it sports or dancing.": "Sarita",
  "The idea of growing up in the South and being a man is an interesting thing; there's a lot masculinity involved, with hunting, fishing, and playing sports that rural people take pride in, but at the same time, I grew up really not wanting to hate anybody.": "Jason",
  "I wanted to really ingrain myself in the culture and the people. And I apologize about having an allergy to dairy products that gives me some irritable bowels, but other than that, I mean, I've embraced just about everything else Wisconsin - especially when it comes to sports, but also the people and the interactions with our fans.": "Aaron",
  "The problem with winter sports is that - follow me closely here - they generally take place in winter.": "Dave",
  "Sports is human life in microcosm.": "Howard",
  "In the field of sports you are more or less accepted for what you do rather than what you are.": "Althea",
  "I sort of try to write everything for me. I'm a huge sports fan but have no interest in minutiae. I don't remember who won Super Bowls five years ago or listen to sports talk radio. I'm trying to make sure the jokes are self-contained so they're accessible to everyone.": "Norm",
  "It sounds like a cliche, but it... you do sing about what you know about. And I grew up in a small town, and I grew up in a place where your whole world revolved around friends, family, school, and church, and sports.": "Kenny",
  "Actually, I always dreamed about getting a gold medal in the 100-meter freestyle in Olympic swimming. I always thought that would be the epic award in sports to get.": "Chris",
  "It's not just the kid who's spent every penny from his job to upgrade his car to tell the world he cares about sports cars, it's also the person driving around in a fuel-conscious hybrid electric car, because it's more a message to the world than an effective means of saving fuel, to be quite honest.": "Richard",
  "I wasn't into sports when I was younger. I was one of those kids who always tried to get a note from the doctor to say I had a cold so I didn't have to go play hockey in bad weather and be miserable.": "Eliza",
  "I like a few vintage Rolexes, and Panerais are good. I'm not into sports watches - I like chronometers.": "Jason",
  "I'm a great sports fan, you know. I love to watch tennis and basketball and baseball and so on.": "Itzhak",
  "When I played sports, if you lose the game, and then you complain, that makes you a sore loser. That doesn't make you protester - that just makes you a whiner.": "D.",
  "When I was a kid, I did many sports. Judo, like my dad, but also volleyball, handball, and gymnastics. We never played much football.": "Robert",
  "As far as oligarchs who acquire sports team abroad, and invest money abroad, I wouldn't treat this phenomenon as something bad.": "Vladimir",
  "As an athlete and as a woman, I get my confidence from playing sports because it shifts your focus from what your body looks like to what your body can do for you. That's what we all should be doing. It shouldn't be about looking perfect.": "Venus",
  "My dad is the reason I actually started watching wrestling. My dad was never big into sports; we were all big into sports as kids, and he'd go to our Little League games or whatever and not really know what was going on, because he didn't know about sports, but he knew about wrestling.": "John",
  "My son is trying to be a sports writer, and my daughter is a college student. She wants to be a comedy writer, and she's at film school. I discouraged both of them early on from getting involved in Starbucks. I didn't think it would be fair; plus, they didn't have any interest anyway.": "Howard",
  "If you're a dope like me, you get every sports channel you can get. I'm watching, you know, Netherlands soccer.": "Michael",
  "What separates sports from entrepreneurism, however, is that in business we constantly have to overcome undefined and unpredictable challenges. Athletes train for specific events and conditions, whereas entrepreneurs generally have little idea what they will encounter along the way.": "Naveen",
  "Sports without music is just a game. Music makes it entertaining.": "Ice",
  "I would never tell anybody to give up hockey - the great sports we have here - basketball, lacrosse - rugby coming into its own - we've got so many great team sports, and I say hold on to them.": "George",
  "I have been president of the Indian Kabbadi Association, and likewise, I have been associated with various other sports as well.": "Sharad",
  "I've always been a reserved cat. When I play sports, there's people used to get mad at me because I didn't hang out and things like that. I've never been that kind of person. Nothing has changed in that regard. I've never been posse, and all that. I'm a quiet storm.": "Bernie",
  "You never know what's going to happen with this crazy world of sports entertainment, so I would never rule out the fact that Rock wants to come home.": "Roman",
  "One of the biggest gaps in sports is the difference between the winning and losing teams of the Super Bowl. They don't invite the losing team to the White House. They don't have parades for them. They don't throw confetti on them.": "John",
  "I have never seen a wrestling match or a prize fight, and I don't want to. When I find out a man is interested in these sports, I drop him.": "Hedy",
  "My becoming an actor wasn't planned. My interest always lied in sports such as football, martial arts, gymnastics and dance.": "Tiger",
  "When I grew up, my father taught us the value of hard work. He wanted us to enjoy ourselves, but he also wanted to know what it took to be successful. He coached a lot of our sports teams growing up. We weren't very good, but we learned about hard work and enjoying life and your teammates.": "Andrew",
  "I drink a lot of Body Armor - it's a sports drink. It offers great hydration, and it's the best before/after drink for workouts. Orange mango is my favorite. Strawberry banana is a close second.": "Andrew",
  "If I ever have downtime, I'm usually sitting in my place playing video games. Or eating sandwiches somewhere, or watching sports some place.": "Hannibal",
  "There are a few things that people all around the world need to admit to themselves. Trade restraints slow economic growth, the euro is not a reserve currency, and scoreless sports ties are boring.": "P.",
  "When I was fifteen, I dreamed of living in the big city, as many a young person does if he is artistic and sensitive. By 'artistic and sensitive' I mean short, skinny, unkissed, bad at sports, and carrying a C average in high school.": "P.",
  "The purpose of sports - even foreign sports - is not to bore people.": "P.",
  "If your man is a sports enthusiast, you may have to resign yourself to his spouting off in a monotone on a prize fight, football game or pennant race.": "Marilyn",
  "Baseball has the great advantage over cricket of being sooner ended.": "George",
  "I was always the youngest person in class, skinny, scrawny, no good at sports. I asserted myself by being smart. But then I got to college and started to get C's and D's. That was fantastic. I no longer had to be the smartest person in the room.": "Douglas",
  "To have a healthy culture, you have to have stable health care financing and stable arts financing and stable sports financing, and if you don't have that, your culture becomes a parking lot.": "Douglas",
  "Selling an electric sports car creates an opportunity to fundamentally change the way America drives.": "Elon",
  "I can't say this enough - the food that you put into your bodies can actually help you get better grades. And it can also affect your performance in sports and other activities too. You see, when you give your body the best possible fuel, you have more energy, you're stronger, you think more quickly.": "Michelle",
  "I like sports, and I enjoy playing basketball and lifting weights.": "Joel",
  "When I used to play sports, I'd be the one cheering the team on, 'Come on, we can beat these guys!' That's just in me.": "Joel",
  "We don't see a lot of models for male social interaction. There's sports and barn raisings.": "Chuck",
  "It was easy being healthy when I was young. I was full of energy, so sports and physical challenges were fun. But as I got older and the spring left my step, exercise became harder, and eating, drinking and watching TV became easier. By the time I was 50, I'd put on 50 pounds.": "Robert",
  "Well, I'm not a big sports fan.": "Jeff",
  "Sports are basically our way of feeling sorry for ourselves. Most men can't become athletes. We're watching guys who actually made it. We see them dunking and making touchdowns. Then we think about ourselves when we were younger.": "Kevin",
  "February is always a bad month for TV sports. Football is gone, basketball is plodding along in the annual midseason doldrums, and baseball is not even mentioned.": "Hunter",
  "I'm always fascinated by the use of the first-person plural talking about sports.": "Penn",
  "My whole family is missing that sports gene. I hope I didn't screw that up by marrying a great golfer.": "Penn",
  "I wouldn't dream of watching motor racing, cycling, or golf - which aren't truly sports anyway.": "Howard",
  "I spend a little time every day to play sports.": "Vladimir",
  "Above all, such sports as judo, in my view, teach people to relate to each other. They teach us to respect a partner, teach us to understand that an externally weak partner can not only put up worthy resistance, but, if you relax and take too much for granted, may even win.": "Vladimir",
  "I watch movies and sports. I can count on the fingers of my hand the number of times I have watched an hour show. I never watch a half-hour show, and I never watch myself.": "William",
  "Most people think the character I do onstage is the way I am offstage, but I'm just a regular guy who spends time with his family and who turns on the television and watches a lot of sports.": "Don",
  "When you look at golf films before us they're all - garbage or satire. A lot of sports films tend to vilify the opposition. Where the opposition becomes this big angry monster, so big you can't beat him.": "Shia",
  "Unfortunately the world is what it is now. People don't get along for whatever reason. As professional athletes, in a way we're almost ambassadors for peace, because sports brings everyone together.": "Venus",
  "In the sports arena I would say there is nothing like training and preparation. You have to train your mind as much as your body.": "Venus",
  "I think women athletes who have been successful need to help other sports, those sports that are just emerging. That's what I've been thinking about and looking forward to.": "Venus",
  "Tennis has been around for so long - women have been playing the majors since the 1800s. Other sports have not had professional leagues for women for as long.": "Venus",
  "Tennis is definitely a star for women in sports.": "Venus",
  "I spent my whole life playing sports and training and pushing myself to the limits.": "Venus",
  "My deep dark secret is that I was a nerd in school. I liked the theater. I liked to study. I wasn't very good at sports.": "Rob",
  "At home I have a copy of the April 21, 1986, issue of 'Sports Illustrated.' I'm on the cover with the blurb, 'Can Lou Do It?' I'd just arrived at Notre Dame, and with spring football underway, I was the focal point of that week's coverage.": "Lou",
  "I look at athletes in all sports and try to picture what kind of football player they'd be, what position they'd play and so on.": "Lou",
  "Pittsburgh felt like the perfect size of a city to me. There's enough to do, but it's not like living in a circus. I also really loved how sports-enthusiastic Pittsburgh people are: how proud of their sports they are.": "Joel",
  "There aren't a lot of opportunities for that rite of passage that makes you a man. War is one of them, and violent sports are another.": "Sylvester",
  "I like a deep sports massage - a casual beating up. I try to get them whenever I can, usually more if I'm getting in shape for a role.": "Chris",
  "I wasn't good in school. I didn't do sports. I sat in the bedroom and listened to records. Because the Beatles did whatever they wanted to, I took that as a kid and said, 'That's what rock is.'": "Chris",
  "I'm sort of like a lame, single guy in a red sports car.": "Billy",
  "I'm actually a fan of all of the EA Sports titles like 'Tiger Woods,' 'Madden,' and I'm really looking forward to buying 'NBA Street V3.'": "John",
  "My dad is not a sports guy but was drawn to the theatrics of wrestling.": "John",
  "The ESPYS are about appreciating moments in sports and not looking down on it because it's maybe not your favorite athlete or your favorite team.": "John",
  "Unlike other sports, which are largely determined by individual athletic ability or team strength, NASCAR requires its competitors to cooperate in order to win.": "Charles",
  "On the court, Jason Collins is not a huge basketball star, but he has already claimed his place in civil rights history as the first openly gay athlete to play in one of the four major U.S. sports leagues.": "Nancy",
  "It certainly is dangerous that there are only a few clubs left in Europe that can afford to pay millions. At the end of the day however, the spectators decide the rates of pay - by watching the games and consuming the goods and services advertised on sports TV programmes.": "Angela",
  "Good spectator sports share certain fundamentals. Their competitors battle head-to-head. Their winners are determined objectively: fastest runner, most points. They are refereed, not judged.": "Alex",
  "Downhill track sports like luge are technology battles, as exciting as a NASCAR qualifying day.": "Alex",
  "Both sexes like the exercise and challenge of sports, but for men it's also a basic display behavior for impressing and winning a mate.": "Helen",
  "My brothers were funny, and there was a lot of shtick and comedy and nastiness and violence and fighting and sports.": "Alec",
  "Not many countries establish a prize for peace. The Seoul Peace Prize has its roots in the 1988 Summer Olympics when this country opened its doors to people and athletes from more than 160 countries. Korea did so in part because it believes in the power of sports for peace and development.": "Ban",
  "If there was a template for success in sports, everyone would follow it. You do the best you can and trust the people you trust.": "Mark",
  "Owning a popular sports team is very different than any other type of business. They don't throw parades when Apple has the biggest quarter in corporate history. People don't call and email asking for anyone from the team to come visit their sick child. They don't cry as they request a jersey of their child's favorite player to be buried with them.": "Mark",
  "Boxing has become America's tragic theater.": "Joyce",
  "I'm girlie in the sense that I like makeup, but I also love sports and man food.": "Carrie",
  "We should reach out to people to try to go after the fans the way other sports do. Because we can't just depend on the fact that it is a great game.": "John",
  "Tennis was a white, upper-class sport, and I wanted it to be treated like other sports were.": "John",
  "I played a ton of team sports growing up, and team wins are just incredibly gratifying.": "Jason",
  "A sports writer is a stylist of some kind. He is trying to convey mood and character and emotion.": "David",
  "Sports passion is deeply, infamously territorial: our city-state is better than your city-state because our city-state's team beat your city-state's team. My attachment to the Sonics is approximately the reverse of this.": "David",
  "I'm a sucker for sports movies.": "David",
  "The movie - any sports movie - becomes a praise song to life here on earth, to physical existence itself, beyond striving, beyond economic necessity.": "David",
  "Sports movies are often very good at dramatizing the intersection of public and private realms: the body politic.": "David",
  "When I was studying at the Iowa Writers School, I read a sports writer, Ron Maly, from the Des Moines Register. He was a good sports writer. I became real interested in the contrast between Lute Olson, who was the coach of Iowa at the time, and Ron Maly.": "David",
  "I think of sports writers as mediating between two worlds. Athletes probably think of sports writers as not macho enough. And people in high culture probably think of sports writers as jocks or something. They are in an interestingly complex position in which they have to mediate the world of body and the world of words.": "David",
  "Sports - especially the NBA - function as a place where American society pretends to discuss and pretends to solve questions and historical agonies that can't possibly be solved within the realm of sports.": "David",
  "What Olympians eat can vary tremendously depending not only on the events they're competing in, but also their body type and lifestyle outside the Olympic arena. Their diets are affected not only by the demands of their sports, but by everything else in their lives, things that are almost impossible to accurately measure and factor in.": "Chuck",
  "Nike used to be known as Blue Ribbon Sports. What's now Sara Lee used to be Consolidated Foods. And Exxon was once Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. These were name changes that worked. But for all the ones that do, there are 10 or 20 that don't.": "James",
  "In Tulsa, it was sports or nothing.": "Bill",
  "When somebody asks about the greatest players in history, I start with Bill Russell. More than the best player is the MVP, and the MVP in the history of team sports is Bill Russell.": "Bobby",
  "At the end of the day, everything is God's plan, and he cares about what we do. He cares about our hearts, how we play the game, and how we treat people. He's definitely involved with how we handle sports and not just the outcome of it. I'm proud when athletes mention God in any way.": "Tim",
  "I want to support kids that not a lot of people believe in. Give them an opportunity to do good in school, play sports and get scholarships.": "Tim",
  "I was a sports kid.": "Mahershala",
  "In a small town, it's either sports or a band with your buddies. I was always athletic. But in college, I was exposed to all this new music, and I was drawn to hip-hop and R&B.": "Sam",
  "I've always craved winning. It's just easier in sports because there's a scoreboard.": "Sam",
  "I was totally dominated and revered my father. I admired everything he did. He was a great sports person. He loved me. I was his only boy at that time, before my brother Billy came along.": "Jimmy",
  "I don't watch too much TV when it comes to sports or news or things like that.": "Colin",
  "I played a lot of sports when I was a kid so I get in that ballgame mindset of being really, really respectful, but at same time saying to yourself, 'Don't back down a single inch, hang with these guys if you can.' If they throw it high and tight you have to stand in there, you can't take yourself out of that moment.": "Michael",
  "I'm getting more and more bored with professional sports, but I still watch.": "Michael",
  "Even from their infancy we frame them to the sports of love: their instruction, behavior, attire, grace, learning and all their words azimuth only at love, respects only affection. Their nurses and their keepers imprint no other thing in them.": "Michel",
  "For truly it is to be noted, that children's plays are not sports, and should be deemed as their most serious actions.": "Michel",
  "Mayweather Promotions - we are the past, the present, and the future of sports and entertainment, and everybody knows Mayweather's pay is better.": "Floyd",
  "I come from a very athletic family. But I didn't have the typical Jewish sports heroes. I mean, like lots of Jewish kids I admired Sandy Koufax. But I didn't look up to him as the one person who gave me the desire to push on and succeed. My brothers did that for me.": "Bill",
  "What passes for sports coverage is terribly sycophantic.": "Billy",
  "Don't let anyone turn you into a slave. You're a slave if you let the media tell you that sports and entertainment are more important than developing your brain.": "Ben",
  "In order to develop the country's sports in line with the great leaders' ideas and plan of developing Juche-based sports, our Party directs great efforts to the work of the sports sector.": "Kim",
  "Building a sports power is a patriotic undertaking aimed at translating into reality the plan and wish of the great leaders, who devoted their efforts to building ours into a country that prospers and grows stronger on the strength of sports.": "Kim",
  "I'm a mad lover of sport. You cannot say a bad word to me about sports. So I know business is involved and I know it can be cynical, and, of course, I watch it, but for me it's pure.": "Hugh",
  "Most people never run far enough on their first wind to find out they've got a second.": "William",
  "It's always been such a big part of my life to be fit and healthy and be outside and run and play sports. It gives me energy. Sometimes, I have these days where I don't do anything because I have the days off, and I just need to relax, and I actually get more tired.": "Caroline",
  "I think they need to get a more reliable way of watching television on the laptop. Because I travel so much, if I want to watch my favorite sports team it might not be showing in that place, so I want a reliable way to watch whatever I want to watch on my laptop.": "John",
  "Fantasy sports went a long way toward developing the sabermetrics formulas used not only by oddsmakers but general managers in hiring players. So the amateur fantasists ended up creating some of the algorithms that Oakland GM Billy Bean's statisticians used to win games with less salary money available for star players.": "Douglas",
  "Breaking records is not something you expect to be doing. That's like a sports thing, it's not usually a comedy and writing thing.": "Louis",
  "ABC wouldn't be a player in the news major leagues until the 1970s, when Roone Arledge brought to ABC News the energy and programming approach he had applied to ABC Sports.": "Tom",
  "I've got some great stuff in my sports memorabilia collection. But my favorite thing by far is the robe. I actually have a Ric Flair robe with 'the Nature Boy' on the back. That's awesome. When I look at it, it brings back so many memories of my childhood and my teen years.": "Darius",
  "Sports are sports. Its all about how we carry ourselves out of the ring.": "George",
  "I'd have to say losing the title to Ali in '74 was the lowest moment in sports for me. It was the most devastating thing in my boxing career, and it still hurts to this day.": "George",
  "My sister is totally my dad's daughter because she loves sports.": "Ashley",
  "Oh God, I'm awful at sports. In gym I just try and avoid getting hit in the face.": "Tavi",
  "I made the cover of 'Sports Illustrated,' 'Newsweek' and 'Time' all in one week, and I didn't even know what that meant.": "Nadia",
  "I started my career as a swimsuit model. My first big break in America was 2007, 'Sports Illustrated' Swimsuit Issue.": "Irina",
  "No one pretends anymore that the Olympics are just about sports. It's routine to talk about what effect holding the Games in this or that capital will have on the host country's international reputation, how a nation's prestige can be raised by its medal count.": "George",
  "The Olympics are never just about sports.": "George",
  "If the presidential nominating process were an international sports competition, one would assume that top officials of both parties were taking envelopes of cash from town chairs in Durham and precinct captains in Waterloo.": "George",
  "Of course the first version of an all-electric sports car is going to be expensive.": "Jason",
  "I don't do sports, really.": "Stellan",
  "In various fields, such as science, technology, sports, business and the arts, immigrants enrich our culture every single day.": "Charles",
  "I did play other sports growing up. I played cricket and all those other things, but I was just so much more talented in golf, and that's all I wanted to do.": "Jason",
  "I'm into outdoor sports like hiking, windsurfing, water-skiing.": "Nikki",
  "I read a lot growing up. It was kind of my comfort, you know; I loved it. I love story. I love narrative. I was academic. I wasn't particularly athletic. I didn't make the drill team. I didn't go out for sports.": "Julianne",
  "If you want experiences to make you a better person, then you play two or three sports.": "Jim",
  "Museums are like sports stadiums, hotels and hospitals: they are in the category of captive-audience dining.": "Danny",
  "Restaurants and chefs have become followed by such a broad swath of the public, in a way that used to be reserved for sports stars, movie stars, and theater actors. Restaurants are in the firmament of today's common culture.": "Danny",
  "I know I could be the host of 'SportsCenter' in two years if I changed my show today to sports.": "Gary",
  "The main thing is healthy eating, exercise, which I do for special events, like if it's Sports Illustrated, or the swim suit catalogue for Victoria's Secret, or my own calendar that I did for the year 2000.": "Heidi",
  "I grew up reading the newspapers, mostly the sports section. I was a wrestler and would check to see if I was ranked.": "Michael",
  "It's so important for kids to get involved with sports in general at a young age.": "Lindsey",
  "I get very into my sports.": "Margot",
  "I was not good at team sports, I have to say. I'm quite good at individual sports, but I was not good at team sports, so I wasn't good at baseball and football.": "Tom",
  "I grew up in a two-parent household. We all played sports, all sports, which cost a lot of money. My pops was an attorney; he went to College of the Holy Cross with Clarence Thomas. My mom worked a bit, then gradually came home and took care of us full time.": "Omari",
  "I'm a black Catholic raised in Decatur, Georgia, which was very gang-infested. Then, I went to an all-white private high school and excelled in sports and wrote poetry, then played football at the University of Georgia, minoring in drama.": "Omari",
  "I always loved the way music made me feel. I did sports at school and all, but when I got home, it was just music. Everybody in my neighborhood loved music. I could jump the back fence and be in the park where there were ghetto blasters everywhere.": "Dr.",
  "When did I know I had talent? I think it started when I first started playing sports, organized sports.": "LeBron",
  "I remember growing up, having sports to go to, having recess, those were the things I looked forward to. Yes, I'm an athlete, but I had buddies who weren't, and they looked forward to it, too.": "Ashton",
  "If somebody wants me to do something I've never done, I can do it more easily because of all of the years of sports I've played.": "Ashton",
  "I went to a football school, which meant that I went to a university that served up education and was simultaneously operating a sports franchise.": "Susan",
  "I have long been one of those tedious people who rails against the coronation of 'student-athletes.' I have heard the argument that big-time athletics bring in loads of money to universities. I don't believe the money goes anywhere other than back into the sports teams, but that's another story.": "Susan",
  "I'm not good at a lot of things. I am not good at keeping my room clean. I am not good at eating healthy. I am not good at sports anymore. I used to be! Not so much anymore.": "Zendaya",
  "The 2006 federal Internet gaming statute is not ambiguous. It does not prohibit gambling on fantasy sports.": "Eric",
  "Our investigation has found that, unlike traditional fantasy sports, daily fantasy sports companies are engaged in illegal gambling under New York law, causing the same kinds of social and economic harms as other forms of illegal gambling and misleading New York consumers.": "Eric",
  "Daily fantasy sports is neither victimless nor harmless, and it is clear that DraftKings and FanDuel are the leaders of a massive, multi-billion-dollar scheme intended to evade the law and fleece sports fans across the country.": "Eric",
  "Daily fantasy sports is much closer to online poker than it is to traditional fantasy sports.": "Eric",
  "Unlike most traditional, season-long fantasy sports sites, which make most of their money from administrative fees and advertising, FanDuel and DraftKings take a cut of every bet. That is what bookies do, and it is illegal in New York.": "Eric",
  "Predominantly I'm an Adidas guy who walks around in sports gear all the time because there's always a ball right next to me somewhere. I do a lot of sports, but I do enjoy wearing a lot of suits.": "Mads",
  "I haven't watched that much TV, to be honest. To be honest, I don't watch that many films anymore - partly because I don't have time; secondly, because I watch a lot of sports, and I love watching sports.": "Mads",
  "I go to the pub, hang out with my family - that's pretty much it. I also do a lot of sports when I get the chance. I'm actually a pretty mellow guy.": "Mads",
  "I was into sports and swimming as a kid and didn't spend a whole lot of time sitting down. I was a gymnast.": "Mads",
  "Where is women's sports prominently displayed with the men? Tennis is the only thing I can think of.": "Ronda",
  "Judo was one of those sports where they give you guidelines but then try to tell you to develop your own style.": "Ronda",
  "If I had not been dyslexic, I wouldn't have needed sports. I would have been like every other kid. Instead, I found my one thing, and I was never going to let go of it. That little dyslexic kid is always in the back of your head.": "Caitlyn",
  "I got into sports because that was a way to prove your masculinity. I was good at it.": "Caitlyn",
  "Sports saved my life.": "Caitlyn",
  "My greatest gift in life was being dyslexic. It made me special. It made me different. If I had not been dyslexic, I wouldn't have needed sports.": "Caitlyn",
  "It's so great to watch sports live. I think everyone should watch it up close once, if possible. I would like to see every sport live at least once to fully appreciate what's happening on the court or on the field or on the ice or whatever the playing surface may be.": "Diane",
  "I like to follow my favorite team and talk sports with my band or fans. You won't believe how many musicians are sports fans. We have so much time on tour that we need these outlets for relaxation.": "Garth",
  "I think, without question, the way someone plays sports shows something about inherently who they are, you know?": "Hill",
  "I started modeling when I was about 2 or 3 years old; I started with Baby Guess, and I did Guess Kids, and that was the extent of my modeling career as a kid. I took all of my elementary, middle and high school years off to focus on school and sports.": "Gigi",
  "I love sports - I used to play volleyball really competitively...I went to Junior Olympic qualifiers, and I've ridden horses my whole life.": "Gigi",
  "I come from a very sporting family and played many sports as a lad.": "Martin",
  "I'm not a girly girl. I go to the bar. I like to get dirty. I love sports. I'm like the son my dad never had.": "Kaley",
  "Music has done a lot to enhance the emotions of sports. It's played in arenas. Whenever there is footage cut together they're always using music. And it goes together, you know.": "Ice",
  "When you think about the NASCAR brand, it resonates everywhere. They have the No. 1 sports brand.": "Magic",
  "I have a fond place in my heart for Seattle, so I hope that an NBA team comes back to this great city, this great sports city.": "Magic",
  "My work ethic is from sports.": "Magic",
  "Seven has always been my lucky number. It's on my guitar pick; in sports, that was always the number I was, and 'Riser' is my seventh album. With this album kind of coming to an end and having seven nominations at the ACMs, it feels like a bigger story in play for me, and it's the perfect number. I wouldn't have wanted eight!": "Dierks",
  "I talk to people of different ages, and a guy who's 38 who says, 'I could've played Major League Baseball, but I had this knee injury...' Yeah, probably not. It's a big thing with men and sports, where they think they could have touched that thing.": "Christopher",
  "When you play sports like tennis, you're alone, and that's a good school for life, but it's also a good school for life to bring your best and make those around you better, too - helping others in difficult moments.": "Jurgen",
  "Foreign policy simply cannot be judged by today's headlines that chalk up victories and defeats like so many box scores in the sports sections.": "Condoleezza",
  "Growing up, all I did was play sports. I always loved music, but I never even thought I'd be on stage one day.": "Cole",
  "After I went to college, I realized that no matter how much I loved sports, I was ready to have fun, and that was right when I started to sing.": "Cole",
  "For a kid, self-esteem can be as close at hand as a sports victory or a sense of belonging in a peer group. It's a much more complicated and elusive proposition for adults, subject to the responsibilities and vicissitudes of grown-up life.": "Meghan",
  "I always tell writers that it's good to have an area of expertise. It's a really practical answer, I know, but know about science or about sports or about medicine, so you can work as a science writer or a sports writer. Don't just know about yourself.": "Meghan",
  "Every successful sports season I had included detailed daily itineraries. We received one in the morning and one before practice, and they set us up to win.": "Lewis",
  "I never played sports or got into the whole guy camaraderie of, like, 'I love you, man! Seniors forever!' So suddenly being in the military with these guys who were under these very heightened circumstances, isolated from their families, living this very kind of Greek lifestyle, it changed my life in a really big way.": "Adam",
  "Let's face it: in advertising, you are paid more, but you die younger. It's not very forgiving. Like sports stars, you're in it during your better years, and then you're out looking for work.": "Jerry",
  "I don't follow sports that much now, but I was a Phoenix Suns fanatic in the early '90s.": "Jesse",
  "I'm not much involved in sports, and I don't play, either.": "Kriti",
  "Sports can't be run by governments.": "Kapil",
  "Governments getting involved in sports activities would ultimately damage sports.": "Kapil",
  "If there are malpractices in sports, part of the solution lies in the organisations themselves taking a very strong view and cleaning up the mess from within.": "Kapil",
  "When I was really young, I can remember being into fashion, but I was really into horses and sports.": "Kendall",
  "Sometimes emotions can win fights. Sometimes letting your feelings out in a fight can win you the fight. When it means the world to you, it's not just a sports contest - a boxing match for money or belts.": "Tyson",
  "I've always been a guy who wants to play sports, not watch them.": "Shaun",
  "I always tell people that our sports aren't that dangerous.": "Shaun",
  "What drives me now is the fact that I feel like I still have so many tricks that I want to learn and so many things that I can still do. And so many cool things outside of sports that I have been doing.": "Shaun",
  "My exercise regime is a mix of gymming, marital arts, sports, etc.": "Sushant",
  "What's been missing from regions outside of Silicon Valley is a 'playbook.' In American football, a playbook contains a sports team's strategies and plays. It struck me that every region needs its own industry playbook on how to compete globally.": "Steve",
  "Immigrants use debt intelligently. They understand the difference between active debt: creating a business, or something to make business better, and dead debt: buying that new sports car or the 60 inch television. Those things don't lead to the good life. They delay getting it.": "Fabrizio",
  "Pfizer's actually teamed up with my nonprofit organization, which is called Adaptive Action Sports. I cofounded this organization in 2005 to help people with physical disabilities get involved in action sports, go snowboarding, skateboarding.": "Amy",
  "I was into basketball, but then once I found contact sports, it was over. I never played basketball again in my life.": "Daniel",
  "I've never been in the top three of Sports Personality. And I won't be in the top three again. You have just got to accept what it is.": "Mo",
  "Boxing should focus on pitting champion versus champion - those are the fights that everyone wants to see. The sports also needs to work on developing new heroes and personalities. I'd like to see more vignettes on fighters, focusing on their lives, goals and stories. Boxers need to be larger than life.": "Sugar",
  "I'm honoured and delighted to be named the 'Irish Times'/Irish Sports Council Sportswoman of the Year 2014. This has been an amazing year for me and for Irish women in sport, and I would like to congratulate all the finalists in their respective fields who have excelled at major sporting events.": "Katie",
  "If you look at all aspects of all sports, everything comes down to basics and fundamentals.": "Robbie",
  "Adidas is one of the biggest companies in the world. To have a company like that, a mainstream company, a major sports company, to say they want me, it's awesome.": "Robbie",
  "That's really what drew me into wrestling. To see my own uncle put on the mask every Friday to go into the ring, and me putting on his masks to play wrestle with him. It was a whole different world when it came down to sports.": "Rey",
  "I am excited to join Combate Americas on NBC UNIVERSO, and look forward to building this incredible MMA sports brand and supporting the extremely talented athletes on its growing roster.": "Rey",
  "I photographed all kinds of sports - Formula 1, Formula Atlantic. And anybody who knows me knows that, from the day they invented video cameras, I used to lug them around when you had to carry the pack here and the big camera here, plus the diaper bag and a baby and the purse or whatever.": "Christie",
  "I remember my first 'Sports Illustrated' shoot was with the photographer Walter Iooss, and Julie Campbell was the editor, and we were at the president of Mexico's private house in Cancun - this was before anything else that's now in Cancun even existed. And they told me to get a tan, so I spent all morning in the sun, and I was burnt.": "Christie",
  "When doing sports... on the water, it's crucial to stop aging by protecting your skin.": "Christie",
  "Colleges produce more sports therapists than engineers. Perhaps because America is a sporty country: a lot of outdoors.": "Azim",
  "Believe it or not, I worked four summers in college as a sports writer covering baseball for a parks and rec department in Bayonne, N.J.": "George",
  "The sports apparel industry was dominated by the big shoe companies. But there was a void in apparel and I decided to fill it.": "Kevin",
  "As the National Football League and other pro sports increasingly reckon with the early dementia, mental health issues, suicides and even criminal behavior of former players, the risk of what's known as chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), is becoming clear.": "Jeffrey",
  "The families of many athletes - incensed at the sports leagues and hoping to make games safer overall - are increasingly making the brains of players who die prematurely and suspiciously available for study. Some athletes are even making the bequest themselves.": "Jeffrey",
  "Most of us have had that experience - at around puberty - of realising that, despite whatever efforts we put into our chosen sports, we will become at best competent.": "Will",
  "If the government announced that it was going to allocate a vast tranche of education funding purely to the pupils at the best public schools, there would be a national outcry - and yet this is precisely what the Olympics represents in terms of sports funding.": "Will",
  "I hit my knees and I went to him with that and I said God I want to do what you want. I don't want sports to be an idol in my life.": "Ben",
  "Outside the Olympics, there are massive discrepancies within all sports. But the positive side for me is that the Olympics are the biggest platform there is, and there's total equality across all sports.": "Lizzie",
  "Being a celebrity you always get really good seats to sporting events but you never get as good seats as the photographers get. And I really love sports. So one of the scams I have going now is I want to learn sports photography so I can get better seats at a sporting event.": "Drew",
  "Being a celebrity, you always get really good seats to sporting events, but you never get as good seats as the photographers get. And I really love sports.": "Drew",
  "But sports photography isn't something you just pick up overnight. You can't do it once a year for fun and expect to do a good job. And I take pride in what I do.": "Drew",
  "International soccer has been a big part of my love for the sport. I love the Men's National Team. I can say that they're my favorite sports team.": "Drew",
  "Sports has kept me on the straight and narrow path.": "Tommy",
  "The paradox of endurance sports is that an athlete can never work as hard as he wants, because if he pushes himself too far, his hematocrit will fall.": "Malcolm",
  "When you write about sports, you're allowed to engage in mischief. Nothing is at stake.": "Malcolm",
  "In tennis, you can have a bad set and still win. The part of track cycling that is difficult to find in other sports is that it's so final; there's no second chance if you make a mistake.": "Victoria",
  "It would be great to be recognised for my achievements, but Sports Personality isn't about that.": "Victoria",
  "When we do 'Sports Illustrated,' it starts the night before. You do a St. Tropez tan that night, then baby oil gel, then body color.": "Chrissy",
  "When I was a kid, the idea of gettin' paid to paint your face... listen, I grew up in Ossining, New York, a nice little town by the Hudson, and nothin' ever interested me except being your usual high school big shot, which I was an' loved it, played all the sports and goofed around, always out on the street with the guys, everything was funny t'me.": "Peter",
  "I love sports. I love animals. I love kids. I want to save the world. So how do I combine all those things? I don't know.": "Joan",
  "I remember running at school sports day, and I would win everything, but I wasn't a super athlete or a superstar at high school.": "Shelly-Ann",
  "I have a great deal of respect for any women that will enter the world of little boys of sports.": "Jennifer",
  "Some anthems are great for sports. You've got the Russian national anthem... 'O Canada,' how wonderful is that for hockey... but I chose the Italian national song because at my first World Cup, I saw the Italians play four times, and they won all four times - they won the championship.": "George",
  "When I was a kid, my father brought home the autobiography of Sid Luckman, the great Chicago Bears quarterback - probably an extra copy from the sports department where he worked. It was the first sports biography I ever read.": "George",
  "Television is making sports universal; for the same reason, big-time soccer is growing more popular in the United States.": "George",
  "There may not be much future for the kind of sports column I did.": "George",
  "I know, I know - men have that extra hero gene in their foolish makeup; it's part of our charm. But I happen to know some women who have their inner sports hero, too.": "George",
  "This occasional sports columnist, who has been to his share of Super Bowls, had been glad to be home on Super Bowl Sunday, but the scary commercials made me want to be in the melee of the arena, where you are not aware of commercials.": "George",
  "I will always treasure the privilege of writing the 'Sports of The Times' column.": "George",
  "In recent generations, women's sports have been a blessing. Some of us can remember the bad old days in the '50s, when we would discover in casual schoolyard play that a girl could outrun most of us or hold her own in basketball or hit a softball - but there were no teams, no coaches, for girls.": "George",
  "Some religious guys in sports give the impression, 'I've got something you don't have.'": "George",
  "Some of the most inspiring moments in sports have come from players with physical defects. Tom Dempsey, born without toes on his right foot, kicked a 63-yard field goal in 1970, using a straighter, wider shoe.": "George",
  "Youth sports could not exist without millions of volunteers and modestly paid coaches who teach our children how to skate and catch and dribble and also how to get along with others.": "George",
  "Hockey suffers from being compared to itself in ways that other sports are not. Every four years, some of us fawn over Olympic hockey, a great event with bigger rinks, minimal goonishness and national pride in addition to the heightened skills of veritable all-star squads.": "George",
  "I will openly admit that I've never really followed hockey. Given my New England upbringing, I have always adhered to the Celtics, Patriots, Red Sox, Bruins mantra of professional sports fandom, but hockey was definitely the lowest sport on the totem pole - even when the Bruins won the Stanley Cup.": "Rachel",
  "Michael Phelps is a sporting god among men. It is hard to say if anyone will ever match his accomplishments, but it has been an honor to see him become a legend. He makes me proud of the American sports institution and proud of the sports that get mass attention only every four years.": "Johnny",
  "Even as a little kid, I was fascinated by newspapers and magazines. They were my TV. I'd be the first one up to grab the morning paper, mainly to look at the sports pictures, the war pictures.": "Dan",
  "The first thing they gave me at 'Sports Illustrated' was a first-class air card. 'And oh, by the way, there's the petty cash drawer,' they told me. 'Take a few thousand dollars for expenses.'": "Dan",
  "The key to any good sports story is identifying the defining moment. In football games or a boxing match, it's usually pretty obvious. But in golf, sometimes it happens on Thursday. Usually it's Sunday, but guys who don't know the game, they can miss it.": "Dan",
  "Sally Jenkins of the 'Washington Post' is the best sports columnist in the country. Second best is Gene Wojciechowski of ESPN.com, and third is Dan Wetzel on Yahoo!": "Dan",
  "When I first started designing sportswear, I felt that women weren't represented in sports performance. I felt that men were dressed really well both technically and visually, and women were almost like an afterthought.": "Stella",
  "I'm a character and a sports entertainer and a wrestler, but I'm also a father and a husband and a provider.": "Roman",
  "I hate to let people down. I was like that in sports and I was like that in comedy. I was like that at work. When I worked General Motors and stuff like that, when I say something, I mean it.": "Bernie",
  "The fewer rules a coach has, the fewer rules there are for players to break.": "John",
  "Sports has always been a pass-through. You pay for something, and then you pass it through to television, you pass it through to advertisers, or you pass it through to season-ticket holders, luxury boxes and then the fans. Then it all adds up, and you take in more than you pass out.": "John",
  "I tried golf for a while, but I wasn't very good at it, so I didn't play a lot of golf. I enjoy all sports, not just football. I like basketball, baseball, and I got into the World Cup. So really, sports in general are my life, and football specifically.": "John",
  "I was an old tackle riding around talking to people about sports. Like I've said to a lot of people over the years, 'I only go where old tackles go, and if an old tackle does not belong there, I'm not going.'": "John",
  "Don't use your advance to buy an antique sports car, diamonds by the yard, or a bottle of wine from Thomas Jefferson's cellar instead of investing in your book.": "M.",
  "People forget that track and field is one of the hardest sports because we compete against all the world. There are many sports when you are up against only 15 or 20 countries.": "Greg",
  "I was quite lucky: although my dad worked a lot, whenever he was free, he would play sports with me and my brother, and I can't wait to do that with my child.": "Greg",
  "It will be good fun finding out what sport baby's good at; perhaps it will be something obscure. My parents were fantastic at taking me to training sessions and letting me try lots of different sports, so I want to do the same.": "Greg",
  "I'm incredibly competitive in all sports in a way that is so mystifying to my wife because she grew up playing the violin and piano. I've always been like that.": "Geoff",
  "I have always thought you could take the measure of a man by his sports manners - that is to say, the way in which he conducts himself on the playing field, or even over a game of chess or cards.": "Graydon",
  "I enjoy sports in person.": "Shania",
  "The growth of women's soccer and women's sports all around the world has been slow.": "Abby",
  "When you're a pro athlete, life is very narcissistic - everything relates back to you and how you play. When you are getting out of pro sports, you suddenly have to get a little more mindful of what's going on around you and how you affect the rest of the world.": "Abby",
  "There have been times - and not just on 'The Newsroom,' but on 'The West Wing,' 'Sports Night,' 'Studio 60'... - where it was hard to look the cast and crew in the eye, when I put a script on the table that I knew just wasn't good enough.": "Aaron",
  "I get the 'The New York Times' and 'Los Angeles Times' thrown at my door every morning. I'll read the front page of 'The New York Times,' then the op-eds, then scan the arts section and then the sports section. Then I do the same with the 'L.A. Times.'": "Aaron",
  "I was into sports and dancing. I ran track. I have a lot of stamina.": "Jennifer",
  "Team sports aren't my thing. I find it easier to pick something up if I can do it at my own speed. And you don't need a partner to go running, you don't need a particular place, like in tennis, just a pair of trainers.": "Haruki",
  "I think I was a good student, because I jumped over a school. My main interest was basically history and literature. Sports were basically basketball and swimming at a pool. I was so happy.": "Shimon",
  "It's a round ball and a round bat, and you got to hit it square.": "Pete",
  "I like Barack Obama as a person. He's articulate, he knows sports, his brother-in-law's a coach. He always has the athletes to the White House. But I don't know about some of his policies and some of these people in Congress.": "Pete",
  "I had come across a few sports psychologists, and I had no time for nearly all of them. I just don't think they work in a team environment.": "Brian",
  "I've never bought a sports car.": "Brian",
  "I have done 'Sports Illustrated,' but I don't regret it because it portrayed me in a positive way - as an athlete.": "Alex",
  "I rarely felt or noticed any real divide between girls and boys when I was growing up. Maybe it was because I was so involved in sports and competed with the boys. Maybe it was my mom and dad, who constantly instilled confidence in me and never made me feel as though there were boy activities and girl activities.": "Alex",
  "It wasn't until 1999 when my idols Mia Hamm and Kristine Lilly took home the women's World Cup trophy at the Rose Bowl in front of 40 million TV viewers that I remember thinking how rare it was to see women play sports on TV.": "Alex",
  "I started off playing sports when I was five years old. I played three or four sports all throughout the year.": "Alex",
  "I am huge water sports fan. I love to jet ski, speedboat, water ski. So I love to get away to somewhere sunny and just get on the water and have some fun with some friends.": "Douglas",
  "I don't think there's anything that is a greater area of discrimination against women today than the fact that nowhere in the world is there a female role model in team sports that more than half of a general audience would recognize.": "Warren",
  "Men's competitive team sports focus on the balance between individual achievement and team achievement with the emphasis on team achievement.": "Warren",
  "I'm a big sports fan in general.": "Luke",
  "I like a lot of sports. Especially football - it's my favourite sport. My uncle played football in Barcelona for nine years and played for Spain in three World Cups.": "Rafael",
  "Regardless of what people think of the WWE, we're great at storylines; we're great at drawing money. We're great at causing controversy, and when the other sports do it, they usually do better. It keeps it interesting and makes it fun for the fans.": "Shawn",
  "I put so much pressure on myself to be perfect. Between homework and sports and drama and being social, I slept about four hours a night through high school and college.": "Allison",
  "There isn't a flaw in his golf or his makeup. He will win more majors than Arnold Palmer and me combined. Somebody is going to dust my records. It might as well be Tiger, because he's such a great kid.": "Jack",
  "He has the finest, fundamentally sound golf swing I've ever seen.": "Jack",
  "He's going to be around a long, long time, if his body holds up. That's always a concern with a lot of players because of how much they play. A lot of guys can't handle it. But it looks like he can.": "Jack",
  "When I think about dropping team sports and picking up surfing and also then geeking out radio control planes and gadgetry and all that stuff I love, that's what really now has led me in big part to GoPro.": "Nick",
  "Americans' addiction to sports, with the NFL at the top, is based on the excitement generated by the potential for the unexpected great play which can only happen with honest competition from great athletes.": "Arlen",
  "My parents couldn't handle my energy so they enrolled me in every sport the school was offering. I didn't resent it because I loved sports and picked them up easily.": "Channing",
  "I've aways been good at picking up certain things, like sports and dancing.": "Channing",
  "My dad told us up front, 'Guys, if you want to play sports, go ahead, but it's your decision.'": "Peyton",
  "I've been a Colt for almost all of my adult life, but I guess in life, and in sports, we all know nothing lasts forever. Times change, circumstances change, and that's the reality of playing in the NFL.": "Peyton",
  "I cherished my time playing high school sports.": "Peyton",
  "I hate the cliche of 'just have fun,' but what I've seen in today's sports, especially with parents, is they put so much pressure on the kids.": "Hope",
  "I've always had a foot in everything. As a kid, I was active in sports and theater. Now, I'm learning I have to focus a bit. I'm trying to get to next projects, like writing a screenplay. Once that comes together, I could put my mind to another book - maybe a fun kids' book.": "Maz",
  "I don't do sports, and my idea of hell is being dragged around ruins/museums/famous buildings, so I guess I'm a beach bum.": "John",
  "I think it reaffirmed something that I believed in and conceptually always had faith in which was that you're most effective when you work as a team. I love that about filmmaking. I stopped playing team sports at 15-16 because of acting. I think I find a kind of new team sport in filmmaking in a way.": "Will",
  "I wasn't picked for any of the sports teams at school because I was half the size of everyone else, but now everyone assumes I must have been some sort of rugby player.": "Will",
  "'The Iliad' includes some snappy sports reporting, and writers ever since have been probing athletes for signifiers, for metaphor amped by grit under pressure.": "Katherine",
  "I sort of always had an inkling towards some kind of an art form. I grew up in a very small town, and I just figure-skated. My dad played hockey and I was surrounded by sports, but it wasn't quite doing it for me. I wasn't totally fulfilled, and I did a lot of skating.": "Rachel",
  "I got put into leadership roles very early in life from fifth grade, sixth grade. I always ended up being the quarterback or the leader of the sports teams, and it's kind of benefiting me now.": "Tony",
  "If you got the game, you got the game. That's why Tiger Woods is out there playing golf with Greg Norman.": "Shaquille",
  "I played sports growing up in high school.": "Erin",
  "Even if I did have, you know, a 'Sports Illustrated' body, I'd still wear elegant clothes.": "Adele",
  "Maybe because I am from a sports background, I don't give up easily. I am a fighter.": "Deepika",
  "In track years... track is not like other sports. You do have track athletes that stay in this sport until, like, 35, 36, but I think when you get to 28, it's really difficult.": "Usain",
  "I didn't know anybody in show business, and I never thought it was the path I'd go down. I was hoping it was sports, like so many kids.": "D.",
  "The plays and sports of children are as salutary to them as labor and work are to grown persons.": "Samuel",
  "Editorial imagery licensing includes celebrity, entertainment, sports, and news images that capture what is happening in the world around us.": "Jon",
  "I love team sports.": "Nikolaj",
  "My father is a huge horse racing fan, so I was introduced to the sport long before 'Seabiscuit.' But the role made me an even bigger fan. Horse racing is one of my favorite sports.": "Elizabeth",
  "I had a friend at college who took being poor very personally. He started showering in the sports centre next door and said he wasn't going to pay for the hot water in our flat any more because he didn't use it. He made me and my other friend pay the bills on our own.": "Robert",
  "I've always kind of had an interest in the drums but nothing else. The drums are the only thing I feel I would be good at, because I'm a very physical person. I've always played sports and stuff. Drums would give me something to do.": "Taylor",
  "I always played sports when I was young. I played football and baseball for eight years. I loved football.": "Taylor",
  "I did some sports. It was a bit frustrating. I wasn't the greatest sports person.": "Tim",
  "There's not a long track record of people leaving professional sports to become a software developer.": "Curt",
  "Some of the most racist things that I've ever heard come out of people that are on the air at ESPN. There are some of the biggest racists in sports commentating, and you take it for what it is.": "Curt",
  "The day of parochialism in sports is over. The world is too small for what people like to call 'the good old days.' Fans want the best, wherever they come from.": "Mario",
  "I love all motor sports at the top level.": "Mario",
  "I'm a big sports fan.": "David",
  "I've been a sports fan forever.": "Kygo",
  "My chief gifts are - naturally good at all sports with a raw talent for pretty much everything, which if nurtured could develop into improper talent.": "Michael",
  "I grew up being into sports and I wasn't trained to move my body in the right way for dancing. I'm the last one to get any moves correct. In rehearsals it's always, 'OK, one more take for Zac.'": "Zac",
  "It feels silly to watch endless hours of winter sports every four years, when we never watch them any other time, and we don't even understand the rules, which doesn't stop us from scoring everyone, every run, every skate, every race.": "Jill",
  "Thank you... fantasy football draft, for letting me know that even in my fantasies, I am bad at sports.": "Jimmy",
  "I'm really into extreme sports and just having fun.": "Kellan",
  "I'm not a big sports fan.": "Harlan",
  "I don't necessarily love the sports per se, I love the stories behind them. Also in a kind of perverse way I like to study what it does to us, why we care so much. It's caring about something that's utterly meaningless.": "Harlan",
  "I am so fidgety - I swear I have ADD - and I always need to be doing something or being outside, just playing sports.": "Kellan",
  "I play a lot of sports. I'm not real good at any of them. I'm above adequate.": "Kevin",
  "I only had one player in my 33 years of sports that couldn't be traded. He wore No. 23 - and 45 when he played baseball.": "Jerry",
  "I never heard of anyone saying they want to deploy their capital wisely and go buy a sports franchise. What you want to do is just not lose money. You see, I don't have to work anymore. I tell people I don't have a real job. On the other hand, I learned long ago that you can't go broke if you turn a profit.": "Jerry",
  "We strongly believe that children should not be exposed to smokeless tobacco or see such products being used by their on-field sports heroes.": "Jerry",
  "You get into sports with the idea that you want to win. If you aren't trying to win, what's the point in being involved? Once you do get involved, you realize the team draws so much from the community, and it would be nothing without the support of it. You've got to give back. It needs to be a two-way street.": "Jerry",
  "I got amazing training both with Theatre Sports... back in Edmonton, Alberta - I can't give those people enough credit - and the daytime drama I did. Incredible training, both of them.": "Nathan",
  "At Barca, players were banned from driving their sports cars to training.": "Zlatan",
  "Your body's really only meant to compete at the highest levels of combat sports for a few years.": "Joe",
  "I never in my wildest imagination dreamed that I would somehow become a sports commentator.": "Joe",
  "I was more interested in playing sports than acting. I didn't take acting too seriously until the end of my junior year.": "Ving",
  "It's great to be able to continue my career in Chicago. Playing with the best organization in sports and the best fans in the game is a blessing.": "Patrick",
  "I was always one of those people who would watch the Super Bowl as much for the sports as I did for the ads. I was always just sort of fascinated by the fact that when you turn on the TV, there was motion, there was moving pictures on it.": "Andrew",
  "I started, actually, in journalism when I was - well. I started at the 'New York Times' when I was 18 years old, actually, but really got into journalism when I was 15 years old and had started a sports magazine which was trying to become a national sports magazine.": "Andrew",
  "I have always looked at the world through the prism of money to some degree. If you could follow the money, it explains a lot of things, in all sorts of aspects of the world. You can look at politics through the prism of money. You can look at art through the prism of money. You can look at sports through the prism of money.": "Andrew",
  "I'm not a real sports guy, but I check ESPN.com just so I know what people are talking about.": "Andrew",
  "Involvement in my kids' sports teams is something I have made time for over the years. I've also been able to coach all three of them in baseball and basketball, something that has strengthened our bonds and given me indescribable joy. I wouldn't trade it for anything.": "Thomas",
  "YouTube and other sites will bring together all the diverse media which matters to you, from videos of family and friends to news, music, sports, cooking and much, much more.": "Chad",
  "I don't feel 50. I'm still ambitious, and I've only just got my licence to race sports cars. I race for an Aston Martin team called Beechdean, and it's a huge challenge.": "Paul",
  "When we grew up, we wanted to do two things: to own a sports team and a casino.": "Dan",
  "In today's world, social media, people get judged so much by the last thing that happened, I almost feel, in a way, young people get to see that not only is it OK to fail - that's the way you get to championship success, whether it's sports or business or life.": "Dan",
  "When there were first rumors of us going after LeBron, some fans wondered how we could do that after all that happened. But after the 'Sports Illustrated' letter, every fan is thrilled to have him back. That was so heartfelt.": "Dan",
  "I was a total athlete. I loved sports, but when I realized I wasn't going to be a professional athlete, I realized I wanted to be in movies.": "Seann",
  "I'm the kind of guy that if I don't work out, I will get bigger and look like one of the guys who used to play sports.": "Seann",
  "I've got to be honest and say that, growing up, I wasn't a big sports guy, but I love the camaraderie. I just love people getting together, fighting for a team and getting super-emotional about it.": "Aaron",
  "I was on the snowboard team at my school, but that was the only sports team I was on. I played soccer growing up in elementary school.": "Aaron",
  "At issue when professional sports teams take the name of Native Americans is the problem of mimicry: having appropriated the land and wealth of America's vanquished peoples, settler culture then appropriates the supposed values and spirit of the vanquished as well.": "Greg",
  "I have a Stella McCartney Adidas sports bra. I feel like I'm totally comfortable running. No problem. I have support where I need it.": "Pamela",
  "The NFL is one of the few sports where it's possible to tear things down and start again.": "Shahid",
  "You shouldn't turn on C-SPAN to get your sports update.": "Jason",
  "I think we're actually the only sport that has a mix of men and women competing together. The majority of other sports are separated by gender.": "Charlotte",
  "I think sometimes when it comes to sports, and especially relationships between players and coaches, that people lose track, lose a sense of reality.": "Ricky",
  "People in the States used to think that if girls were good at sports their sexuality would be affected.": "Martina",
  "The goal for the Laureus Sport For Good Foundation is to give kids an opportunity to be involved in sports and hopefully learn some lessons along the way. We want to put them in a safe environment, help them if they need it and maybe they will get a scholarship to a school because of the skills that they learn. Sport is just a starting point.": "Martina",
  "I've given many lessons in many sports over the years to many different people.": "Martina",
  "I can teach many sports, but obviously, tennis is the one. When you do other sports, you see things from different perspectives: different footwork drills, body positions, angles and geometry. All that stuff is helpful, and so when I do other sports, I can see things, because once you know one sport, then the other sport becomes more clear.": "Martina",
  "Most normal boys, as they're growing up, they - in order to become attractive, they might, you know, get good at sports or join a rock band or develop good social skills, and for some reason, I thought that drawing comic books might be my route.": "Adrian",
  "Sports is like a war without the killing.": "Ted",
  "I've had the good fortune to have a much more diverse life than most people would, professional sports and television and news and movies.": "Ted",
  "The Tour de France would make a great movie. Drugs, corruption, political chicanery, guys risking their lives - everything you need for a great sports drama.": "Asif",
  "I was a sports fan long before I had any interest in film-making.": "Asif",
  "I grew up in New Jersey and played sports and rode my bike around. It was a really nice time - kids didn't have cellphones then - and you knew everyone in the town.": "Aileen",
  "My grandmother is a huge Hawkeyes fan, so I, by proxy, have to be one. I'm more of a professional sports fan, and I've never been a huge college fan, but because of my grandmother, I've gotten into a lot of really good Hawkeye games. So, because I'm a good grandson, I'm a Hawkeye fan.": "Corey",
  "The ESPN complex is a 255-acre playland, as beautiful and perfect as the Magic Kingdom itself down the road - except it's sports!": "Jeanne",
  "A lot of athletes use sports psychologists.": "Andy",
  "Boxing, mixed martial arts and tennis are the hardest sports to train for.": "Andy",
  "Everyone has to try to give back as much as possible because I think in all sports it helps kids to have role models or people to look up to. Someone like Jess Ennis, I know a lot of young girls have started to get into athletics stuff because of her, because of her success.": "Andy",
  "I used a lot of sports psychologists when I was younger... sometimes it helped, sometimes it didn't.": "Andy",
  "I leave work by 6:30 P.M. so I can spend some time with the children. Inevitably, we'll end up watching basketball or football. I live in a house of boys, and they're all sports mad, so I don't stand a chance.": "Aerin",
  "Just like I find men who talk sports who don't really know sports annoying, I think men might find women who don't really have a true passion and knowledge of sports maybe not so attractive.": "Gabrielle",
  "I've always had an interest in sports across the board.": "Gabrielle",
  "I played sports year around: basketball, soccer, softball and I ran track year around, from the time I was, like, six, seven.": "Gabrielle",
  "A significant piece of the wealth that the NFL owners garner is a result of the enormous TV revenues they get - and those revenues are supported by a legislatively granted exemption from the antitrust laws that has been made applicable to sports leagues, primarily the NFL.": "Eliot",
  "I love playing sports. I'm overly eager and aggressive and not very skilled, so it leads to many small injuries.": "Rachel",
  "Boxing combines, in perfect proportion, strength, speed, and endurance. Normally, most sports are either about one of the three: either about speed or endurance or strength. Boxing combines all three of them. It's really intense.": "Edgar",
  "Comedy has sort of been my life-long obsession. I literally obsessed over comedy. I really didn't play sports - for me it was just comedy, computers and chess club; those were my big things.": "Chris",
  "While the liberal media elite depict the bowler as a chubby guy with a comb-over and polyester pants, the reality is that bowling is one of the most tech-heavy sports today. Robotic pinsetters and computerized scoring were just the beginning.": "Chris",
  "I think what's going to happen with linear television is it's going to become more linear. It's going to become more about events and more about award shows, live sports - all those things that, really, you can't replicate.": "Ted",
  "I don't think on-demand brings anything extra to sports.": "Ted",
  "I don't know that on-demand sports is remarkably better than live sports.": "Ted",
  "I'll always be into sports. Sports is part of my life forever. My TV stays on ESPN all day long, I'm one of those. I don't even listen to music in the car; all I listen to is sports talk.": "Action",
  "My mom devised a plan to get me out of the house and gave me the choice between ballet or skating. She knew both of those sports were time-consuming and would keep me busy with hours of practice.": "Ashley",
  "Skating is one of those sports you unfortunately see people get stuck in.": "Ashley",
  "I want to stay involved in sports in one way or another.": "Ashley",
  "I love hockey. That's actually one of my favorite sports.": "Ashley",
  "There were only 75 people in my graduating class at the school I attended in Hannah, S.C. It was a small school and that translated into not a lot of opportunities when it came to music. We had academic and sports programs but we never had a consistent music program. We would have a band one year, and a chorus one year, but nothing ever lasted.": "Josh",
  "I started out as a camera operator. I was doing news, and I was doing sports - baseball games and football games. And I was acutely aware of women not really being in those roles then.": "Kathleen",
  "I like to play music and sleep. But most of all, I love to work... I don't really play sports, so I like to spend my time playing guitar or piano.": "Drake",
  "I work for ABC television I have my own syndicated TV series. I've been on the cover of 'Time Magazine' and on the cover of 'Sports Illustrated' five times. ": "Reggie",
  "It was actually drumming that gave me the stamina to get into sports later. I started playing drums at 13, and when I got to the international touring level... I got interested in cross-country skiing, long-distance swimming, bicycling... things that require stamina, not finesse.": "Neil",
  "I had spindly little ankles, and growing up in Canada, I couldn't skate. I was no good at any sports so was very much a pariah through those adolescent years.": "Neil",
  "You can make a lot of money in this game. Just ask my ex-wives. Both of them are so rich that neither of their husbands work.": "Lee",
  "Making movies was more a reaction to not being chosen for sports. Other kids were out there playing at whatever; I was off making something blow up and filming it, or making a mould of my sister's head using alginating plaster.": "J.",
  "I'm a runner from sports. I've been a runner, but I wasn't a cross-country runner or anything like that. I played a lot of soccer growing up.": "Scott",
  "My kids are good athletes and runners. They run in a bunch of sports.": "Scott",
  "Since the break-up of the 1990s, Russia has not had winter sports facilities. All the winter sport venues were effectively located in countries that are no longer part of the federation. There is a strong argument for saying Sochi's legacy will be this country will have winter sports facilities it did not have before.": "Sebastian",
  "I enjoy sports. I get a real joy from playing sports but I don't look for those movies. Oliver Stone wanted to know if I would do Any Given Sunday and it just didn't appeal to me.": "Kevin",
  "We decided that sports, lifestyle and fashion were three elements that could be mixed together to a very unique formula. That's what we did: make Puma a very sports-fashion brand when, at the times, everybody talked about sports and sports performance and functionality. We said, 'Well, it's about more.'": "Jochen",
  "We always try to reinterpret sport in an innovative, fashionable way, and when we do fashion, we're always trying to bring our sports heritage into the fashion world.": "Jochen",
  "I think I'm skilful enough, but I don't consider myself a naturally talented, gifted sports person.": "Tony",
  "The Americans love Aussies, but they're actually quite afraid of us at the same time because they think we're insane. Then they see our sports - league, union, and AFL - and that makes them even more worried.": "Russell",
  "There were two very distinct voices going on in my head and I moved easily between them. One had to do with sports, street life and establishing myself as a male... The other voice, the one I had from my street friends and teammates, was increasingly dealing with the vocabulary of literature.": "Walter",
  "I never played sports. I wasn't any good at them.": "Leighton",
  "I like both athletic girls and girly girls. It depends on their personality. I like girls who can go out and play sports with me and throw the football around, but you don't want a girl who's too much tougher than you. I like brainy girls who can respond to what I'm saying.": "Josh",
  "I play sports.": "Josh",
  "I watch a lot of sport on television. I only watch certain sports, and I only watch them live - I don't think I've ever been able to watch a replay of a match or game of which the result was already decided. I feel bound to cheat and look up what can be looked up.": "A.",
  "Even though I started off being interested in news, and I spent 13 years of my career working in television sports, I always was passionate about television and movies.": "Bob",
  "People have called me Superman my whole life. In various sports, that seems to be the common theme. My favorite superhero is actually the Incredible Hulk. He's the only superhero that can't die.": "Robert",
  "I am a sports fanatic and being able to perform at halftime for the fans of the Steelers and the Jets is such a thrill for me.": "Joe",
  "That's what we need nowadays, is more children that have goals other than being a sports figure or some kind of celebrity.": "Joe",
  "To be candid with you, free agency hurts all sports. It's great for athletes making an enormous amount of money. But to say it helps the sports, I don't believe that.": "Jerry",
  "Sports movies are a genre that I really respond to, but they can be done really poorly and really fall short. The good ones are just so good and inspiring and make you feel good.": "David",
  "When it comes to matters of pro sports, politics or palate, disparate sides claim their party, team and cola to be superior.": "Jen",
  "Remember Circuit City? Bear Stearns? Lehman Brothers? Sports Authority? Once, all were billion-dollar companies - then gone in a moment. The fatal problem might be fraud or corruption, but more often, it's simply that management didn't see 'over the other side of the hill.'": "Stephen",
  "I was always a sports nut but I've lost interest now in whether one bunch of mercenaries in north London is going to beat another bunch of mercenaries from west London.": "John",
  "If they asked me, I did two shifts. I did sports, I did news, because I loved it.": "Larry",
  "Sports are my favorite. It's the first thing I turn to every day.": "Larry",
  "I thought I would be a sports announcer. All I was was a curious kid who wanted to be on the radio.": "Larry",
  "I'm naturally athletic. I've been involved in sports since I could walk. So, for me to be sedentary is just unacceptable. Not only is it great for your physical body, but it gives me more energy during the day if I've worked out. I feel better. I look better.": "Eva",
  "It's my personal opinion, and I firmly believe, that it's important that I keep sports and politics separate.": "Jeff",
  "I would love to be associated with some sports organization. I was a journalism major. That's kind of intriguing, to do something in the political-commentary arena.": "J.",
  "I am the sort of athlete who participates in a lot of winter sports - basketball, for example, is an activity that I'll spend many hours a week watching.": "W.",
  "It takes a tremendous amount of skill to be a football player. And some of these guys have enough skills to do other sports. Soccer could be one. Basketball could be another. Things where you need incredible hand-eye coordination are always options. I think a football player would be able to adapt to a lot of sports.": "Troy",
  "Playing professional sports, it's important to eat healthy and take care of your body. In the offseason, rest is really important to me.": "Troy",
  "If you don't eat right as an athlete, you'll get tired and won't be as sharp. It's simple to drink sodas and sports drinks, but water is the most essential drink to put in your body.": "Troy",
  "I can't divorce myself from my childhood. I try to write as much fiction as I possibly can, but there are so many things that are touchstones of my childhood like being on the swim team and playing soccer and the particularities of sports season and environments that make their way into my books.": "Jeff",
  "Most ball games are lost, not won.": "Casey",
  "The great thing coming from sports is you understand the concept of a team. It leaves no room for being selfish, and that's something I picked up from home.": "Michael",
  "The most successful achievers in sports are people that are really driven and have that spirit of hunger.": "Rei",
  "Sports are supposed to be fun, and so I have fun with the way I dress.": "Craig",
  "Sports are in my soul. That's what drives me.": "Craig",
  "I'm a kid from the small Illinois town of Batavia, who grew up on the Chicago Cubs and made sports his life's work, although there's never been a day where it actually seemed like work.": "Craig",
  "I look forward to continuing my work on the sidelines for Turner Sports.": "Craig",
  "As a young boy, I had the usual hobbies - sports, baseball cards, model airplanes and trains. But I always had a distinct fascination with trains.": "Craig",
  "I was a big sports fan, and I had been closely monitoring Hank Aaron's home run totals since I was a kid playing on the sandlot adjacent to the Foundry and Machine Company in Batavia, Illinois.": "Craig",
  "I was lucky enough when it came to sports and work ethic to be taught some basics that continue to be important.": "Joe",
  "Where I came from, sports were the only way to get out front.": "Joe",
  "Until my senior year, baseball and basketball were my best sports; and even when I was a senior, I still wanted to play baseball professionally. But the family wanted me to go to college, and I guess I agreed with them, or else I would have accepted some of the offers I got.": "Joe",
  "I've been a sports fan all my life, and like most other actors, I'm convinced I could have been a pro athlete if Hollywood hadn't come calling.": "Jamie",

  "Maybe a day will come when we may have to just put on a pair of glasses and see sports events.": "Kapil",
  "Sports is my passion.": "Kapil",
  "Natural hydration is a key factor in any type of sports performance.": "Bikram",
  "I guarantee you, yoga will compete with computers, music, sports, automobiles, the drug industry. Yoga will take over the world!": "Bikram",
  "'Course the world of sports takes itself way too serious. Sports writers are all high and mighty.": "Artie",
  "You know you have a gambling problem when it's 4 A.M. at the Mirage Sports Book and you're walking around going, 'Hey you get the lacrosse scores?'": "Artie",
  "I don't like sports where it's like, you watch a guy on a motorcycle flip or something, then another guy does it, it looks exactly the same, and then at the end one guy gets higher points! It seems so arbitrary; I don't know who's ahead ever.": "Norm",
  "I don't really like politics that much. And I like the order and simplicity of sports. They have an ending. You can argue with your friends about it, but in the end you still like sports. I almost love the fantasy world of sports more than the real world.": "Norm",
  "Funding for sports (and the arts) are often the first things facing the chop in difficult times.": "Lucy",
  "I know many sports fans that don't enjoy soccer. The argument is that there's no action, not enough of it.": "Rabih",
  "Faith, family, academics and then sports was the order of priorities in my family. My parents really stuck to these principles when raising me and my two brothers. As long as we took care of everything, they let us play as much basketball as we wanted.": "Jeremy",
  "Swimming and all other sports have got to get to that place where you have the trust of the people watching it.": "Adam",
  "There is so much hypocrisy in sports.": "Dennis",

  "I wanted to use sports for social change.": "Billie",
  "Maybe it's oldest-child syndrome, but I have always been competitive, even as a kid with sports. It spills into my career.": "Eric",
  "In any small town, sports are really important to the high school, and I wasn't very good at sports.": "Martina",
  "I would love to fall in love and get married and have beautiful children. I mean that's one of the goals in life, I think, to have, and it's a beautiful thing. My sister has kids and all my friends have kids. They show me their, you know their report cards. And I can show them my sports car.": "Tiesto",
  "I'm very down-to-earth and approachable, and I can be one of the guys and watch sports... I like to cook - I'm like the girl next door.": "Marisa",
  "Now, I know you expected me to say that, well, I just kick back in the rocking chair, fished a little bit, listened to Willie Nelson tapes and watched old baseball games on the Classic Sports network. And, tell you the truth, I have done that for maybe about five total minutes.": "Dan",
  "Football is an incredible game. Sometimes it's so incredible, it's unbelievable.": "Tom",
  "At Reliance Foundation schools, we lay special emphasis on value-based education, sports, and overall development of students. That is why the teacher-students ratio is kept at a healthy 1:20 so that all children get proper attention in class.": "Nita",
  "Retirement is purgatory for the former sports star. The world outside organized sports is unforgiving.": "John",
  "If you work hard in real life, people tend to get in your way - either from inertia or prejudice - and they stop you achieving things. It's the worst thing about real life compared with sports, where you generally get what you deserve: if you're the fastest guy, you win; there are no other games being played.": "Daley",
  "Sometimes in football you have to score goals.": "Thierry",
  "I went to dance class as a girl because I didn't like sports, but I never did a dance recital in my life. Never, ever, ever. I felt comfortable dancing, and I was happiest dancing, but I was never the best person in the class.": "Jennifer",
  "I remember when I was growing up, I always wore glasses and so if I was on-stage or just being able to move around playing sports, I was never really able to because I had glasses holding me back. Wearing contacts has just been very helpful.": "Joe",
  "If you offer athletes stipends, then you're into pay-for-play, and that's the ballgame. People should realize that, and they should realize that amateurism never has been a sustainable model for a sports-entertainment industry. It wasn't in tennis. It wasn't in the Olympics. And it's not in big-time college sports.": "Charlie",
  "Your ups and downs in sports, I think they are as normal as daily life: One day you wake up and feel great, the next day you wake up and feel maybe less great.": "Michael",
  "The sports page records people's accomplishments, the front page usually records nothing, but man's failures.": "Barbara",
  "I've got four brothers, so with them and all our friends we had these sports parties in the basement. We'd play basketball, mini-sticks, baseball in the backyard, football, whatever it was. We were busy 24/7.": "Rob",
  "I never really was that passionate about playing sports. But when I was at this Mt. Herman school, I did have the ability to throw the frisbee. So when this sport evolved, it was fun because I was good at it.": "Joel",
  "It's our responsibility for the village to say, 'Hey we're going to create these programs,' whether it's sports, creative arts, music, we need some things to give young people positive things to do, and that's including jobs.": "Common",
  "I come from playing sports. I compete, so I gotta be better than I was last year. I gotta get better, and that better gotta come from just growing. From learning new stuff to working on it, experience it in life, and failing.": "Common",
  "My family knew, but most of the sporting world did not realize that my right hand been some 75% paralyzed.": "Bill",
  "My uncles and other relatives are against encouraging girls in every aspect, and that includes sports. I hardly interact with them. My parents are more open. They back me all the way.": "Saina",
  "If a man can beat you, walk him.": "Satchel",
  "I think that kids aren't even exploring the option of sports anymore, and they don't even know what they could do.": "Allyson",
  "I remember being, like, 5 years old, and my dad took me to a Yankees-Mets game. My dad had me on his shoulders and taught me one of the most important lessons about sports. He said, 'Jesse, just remember one thing, the Mets suck.'": "Jesse",
  "I come from great stock. I didn't come from money. My parents both worked really hard to keep food on the table and give my sister and me opportunities to play sports and see what we were good at.": "Rickie",
  "The Internet is changing what entertainment and sports is. It's not just a few people authoring an experience for others. It's really growing out of what everybody does.": "Gabe",
  "Don't sell yourself short because without that you can't go far in life because after sports the only thing you know is sports and you can't do anything else with that.": "Bo",

  "In sports... you play from the time you're eight years old, and then you're done forever.": "Joe",

  "If you meet the Buddha in the lane, feed him the ball.": "Phil",
  "Approach the game with no preset agendas and you'll probably come away surprised at your overall efforts.": "Phil",
  "I think life is sort of like a competition, whether it's in sports, or it's achieving in school, or it's achieving good relationships with people. And competition is a little bit of what it's all about.": "Sanford",
  "My dad was a sports writer when I was younger and then he became just a general columnist. But I grew up with him literally getting into brawls with football coaches.": "Amy",
  "My father has acted in over 700 films. My mother acted in one film, 'Kismat with Mithun Chakraborty,' in which my father also had a role. My father fell in love with her and would drive her around in his sports car, and they subsequently got married. My mom is the most beautiful woman and I think she has taken some serum to look young all her life.": "Shraddha",
  "I always turn to the sports pages first, which records people's accomplishments. The front page has nothing but man's failures.": "Earl",
  "The biggest lesson from Africa was that life's joys come mostly from relationships and friendships, not from material things. I saw time and again how much fun Africans had with their families and friends and on the sports fields; they laughed all the time.": "Andrew",
  "My dream was always to be on the cover of 'Sports Illustrated.'": "Kate",
  "All sports must be treated on the basis of equality.": "Pierre",
  "The public schools I attended were dominated by athletics and rarely inspiring intellectually, but I enjoyed a small circle of interesting friends despite my ineptitude at team sports and my preference for reading.": "Harold",
  "Let's face it. There is no setup in Pakistan to train and groom young players at the grassroots level in different sports. Those of us who did make a name for ourselves and became champions did it with our own initiative - there was no academy to back us till we reached a certain level on our own.": "Jahangir",
  "We live in a social world now, and there's no denying the power that Twitter has yielded across all verticals. Sports is a perfect fit because fans are highly emotionally charged and things happen quick.": "Amy",
  "For a while I was on the cover of every Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue, which was regarded as the pinnacle of success in America.": "Elle",
  "Denver is home to me, and to be recognized for my achievements in the sports community here is a great honor.": "Carmelo",

  "I love to talk about sports. I love sports it's just something that's in my nature. ": "Genesis",
  "I started playing ball when I was a kid. My dad was a pro ball player and he passed on his knowledge to me.": "Kurt",
  "Swimming is probably the ultimate of burnout sports. It's ironic because millions of people who swim as their regular exercise love the meditation aspect of it you don't wind up with any orthopedic injuries. But when you swim at a world class level for hours and hours - the loneness of the long distance runner. ": "Diana",
  "I was a team sports guy, but I don't do that anymore. When I work out, it's alone.": "Jamie",
  "I think God has it written down for me, that without training and working hard you will never achieve desired results. All three times I have had to toil my way into the Olympics. Talking about pressure, well that is something you have to learn to deal with in sports.": "Vijender",
  "Through the years I have received my share of recognition for efforts in the fields of sports, the arts, the struggle for full citizenship for the Negro people, labor's rights and the fight for peace.": "Paul",
  "I play in the low 80s. If it's any hotter than that, I won't play.": "Joe",
  "To me, acting used to be just, 'Get my face out there, get girls, make a little bit of money, make my mom proud.' It was just like sports. But there were moments in 'Moonlight' that I really felt like I had to know why he is the way he is. Or just people in general - why this person walks around with a frown on their face instead of a smile.": "Trevante",
  "We knew it was going to be the biggest event scheduled in the history of women's sports, but we didn't ever fathom we would be playing before sold-out stadiums all over the country.": "Lorrie",
  "Perhaps the single most important element in mastering the techniques and tactics of racing is experience. But once you have the fundamentals, acquiring the experience is a matter of time.": "Greg",
  "What's a good tournament for him? Winning it. He's good enough.": "Greg",
  "The trouble with jogging is that the ice falls out of your glass.": "Martin",
  "There isn't quite a feeling you get from playing video games that you get when you're playing sports, which is like a sense of euphoria. You just get the satisfaction of doing something active and feeling good after.": "Patrick",
  "The mind is absolutely instrumental in achieving results, even for athletes. Sports psychology is a very small part, but it's extremely important when you're winning and losing races by hundredths and even thousandths of a second.": "Michael",
  "My concentration level blocks out everything. Concentration is why some athletes are better than others. You develop that concentration in training and concentrate in a meet.": "Edwin",
  "I was always a mean and lean athlete - not tall - not large.": "Edwin",
  "I overcame size with mechanics.": "Edwin",
  "I'm not a big sports fan, but I love it when they 'slam dunk.' That's sexy.": "Emma",
  "I am very slow to warm. I've always been sort of a loner. I didn't play team sports. I am better one-on-one than in big groups.": "Rooney",
  "The reason swimming is one of the hardest sports is because you have to be in the pool by yourself every day, making that sacrifice. There's no time to do anything else.": "Chad",
  "I went through baseball as 'a player to be named later.'": "Joe",
  "One thing you learned as a Cubs fan: when you bought you ticket, you could bank on seeing the bottom of the ninth.": "Joe",
  "I love sports. Anytime I can combine sports with a film I'm a happy guy. It's such a natural fit, because sports always seems to be a metaphor for life. Always, always, always.": "Dean",
  "Boxing, for me, it's the beginning of all sports. I'm willing to bet that the first sport was a man against another man in a fight, so I think that's something innate in all of us.": "Omar",
  "Professional sports are something they can't control.": "Troy",
  "I didn't like books where people played on a sports team and won a bunch of games, or went to summer camp and had a wonderful time. I really liked a book where a witch might cut a child's head off or a pack of angry dogs might burst through a door and terrorize a family.": "Daniel",
  "The crowd makes the ballgame.": "Ty",
  "People who think they know what they are talking about when they talk about baseball include the announcers and all of the sports press - no matter how much evidence you present them to the contrary they will continue to think that what they think is right.": "Michael",
  "Sports have always been a big part of my life. At school, I played a lot of different sports, and I was competing with other schools. I did everything: running, volleyball, basketball, soccer, Olympic-style gymnastics, and more! My history with sports gave me good concentration, focus, strength, and motivation to stay healthy.": "Izabel",

  "Sports cars from the '50s and '60s are my favorites.": "Franz",
  "There's nothing masculine about being competitive. There's nothing masculine about trying to be the best at everything you do, nor is there anything wrong with it. I don't know why a female athlete has to defend her femininity just because she chooses to play sports.": "Rebecca",
  "I think sports is one of the places where race plays itself out publicly. Although we pretend it doesn't.": "Claudia",
  "I just think that sports movies have such a built-in visceral, rooting interest, an epic win or lose redemptive quality. When they get it right, it can make for a really rousing movie experience.": "Shawn",
  "Golf is played by twenty million mature American men whose wives think they are out having fun.": "Jim",
  "I played a million different sports when I was growing up. I started when I was probably five or six, and we'd just go from activity to activity to activity. I think, finally, my parents just realized that we were missing something in our lives. They realized that it was time for us as a family to start going to church.": "Sam",
  "I think badminton has a real legacy with more youngsters taking up the sport. Badminton has done really well in that regard compared to other sports.": "Rajiv",
  "We're extremely excited about the assets that Yahoo has in the areas of Sports and Finance and Email and News. You match those up with AOL, and we've just made an exponential leap in capabilities here.": "Lowell",
  "I think sports makes for good drama because it has all the same ingredients as anything worth reading or listening to or watching. Conflict, desire, heartbreak - it's all there.": "Jay",
  "The only athletic sport I ever mastered was backgammon.": "Douglas",
  "He hits the ball a long way and he knows how to win.": "Gary",

  "Pitching is the art of instilling fear.": "Sandy",

  "You know they're not going to lose 162 consecutive games.": "Harry",
  "In football, time and space are the same thing.": "Graham",
  "In 1967, London Weekend Television asked me to head up their sports coverage. I got to work with guys like Brian Moore and Dickie Davies. We were the first ones to come up with the idea of the pundits' panel. Although, since I was one of the pundits, it's debatable how good an idea that was.": "Jimmy",
  "Theatre sports is the best improv training period.": "Wayne",
  "I'm not buddy-buddy with the players. If they need a buddy, let them buy a dog.": "Whitey",
  "Almost every single commercial on television for shampoo, sports shoes, drinks, food, clothes, perfume, cars, etc., is a short fairy tale, for they are given magical qualities.": "Jack",

  "Sports is all about money.": "Lynn",

  "The integrity of the game is everything.": "Peter",
  "Baseball is a public trust. Players turn over, owners turn over and certain commissioners turn over. But baseball goes on.": "Peter",
  "Other sports play once a week but this sport is with us every day.": "Peter",

  "Olympism is the marriage of sport and culture.": "Juan",

  "Baseball happens to be a game of cumulative tension but football, basketball and hockey are played with hand grenades and machine guns.": "John",
  "Watching baseball under the lights is like observing dogs indoors, at a pedigree show. In both instances, the environment is too controlled to suit the species.": "Melvin",

  "Don't play too much golf. Two rounds a day are plenty.": "Harry",
  "Baseball is a man maker.": "Al",
  "I've always been into sports and yoga and running. I actually study a martial arts self-defense program called Krav Maga. I can't quite say it's easy, but it's fun for me and I love to do it.": "Kari",

  "Overall the fundamentals seem to be there and he's obviously got a very mature head on his shoulders. He's got a kind of presence.": "Nick",
  "I checked on the Internet this morning, and I realized that with five individual world titles, I was level with my elders Florian Rousseau and Arnaud Tournant, who were the sprint leaders in France when I started at the French Institute of Sports and taught me everything. I had the chance to overtake them, and I did it.": "Francois",
  "There are two theories on hitting the knuckleball. Unfortunately, neither of them works.": "Charley",
  "If you are going to throw a club, it is important to throw it ahead of you, down the fairway, so you don't have to waste energy going back to pick it up.": "Tommy",
  "The difference in golf and government is that in golf you can't improve your lie.": "George",
  "God made me fast. And when I run, I feel His pleasure.": "Eric",
  "The real lover is the man who can thrill you just by touching your head or smiling into your eyes - or just by staring into space.": "Marilyn",
  "I would like to die on Mars. Just not on impact.": "Elon",
  "We need to give each other the space to grow, to be ourselves, to exercise our diversity. We need to give each other space so that we may both give and receive such beautiful things as ideas, openness, dignity, joy, healing, and inclusion.": "Max",
  "Modern science says: 'The sun is the past, the earth is the present, the moon is the future.' From an incandescent mass we have originated, and into a frozen mass we shall turn. Merciless is the law of nature, and rapidly and irresistibly we are drawn to our doom.": "Nikola",
  "That's one small step for a man, one giant leap for mankind.": "Neil",
  "Make an empty space in any corner of your mind, and creativity will instantly fill it.": "Dee",
  "When we contemplate the whole globe as one great dewdrop, striped and dotted with continents and islands, flying through space with other stars all singing and shining together as one, the whole universe appears as an infinite storm of beauty.": "John",
  "There may be aliens in our Milky Way galaxy, and there are billions of other galaxies. The probability is almost certain that there is life somewhere in space.": "Buzz",
  "Although the life of a person is in a land full of thorns and weeds, there is always a space in which the good seed can grow. You have to trust God.": "Pope",
  "Your sacred space is where you can find yourself again and again.": "Joseph",
  "For the wise man looks into space and he knows there is no limited dimensions.": "Lao",
  "Many a trip continues long after movement in time and space have ceased.": "John",
  "The moon is a friend for the lonesome to talk to.": "Carl",
  "Do you realize that if you fall into a black hole, you will see the entire future of the Universe unfold in front of you in a matter of moments and you will emerge into another space-time created by the singularity of the black hole you just fell into?": "Neil",
  "I think we're going to the moon because it's in the nature of the human being to face challenges. It's by the nature of his deep inner soul... we're required to do these things just as salmon swim upstream.": "Neil",
  "The essence of architecture is form and space, and light is the essential element to the key to architectural design, probably more important than anything. Technology and materials are secondary.": "I.",
  "Space exploration is a force of nature unto itself that no other force in society can rival.": "Neil",
  "You cannot look up at the night sky on the Planet Earth and not wonder what it's like to be up there amongst the stars. And I always look up at the moon and see it as the single most romantic place within the cosmos.": "Tom",
  "We are bombarded on all sides by a vast number of messages we don't want or need. More information is generated in a single day than we can absorb in a lifetime. To fully enjoy life, all of us must find our own breathing space and peace of mind.": "James",
  "Space is the breath of art.": "Frank",
  "I've always liked depressing music because a lot of times, listening to it when you're down can actually make you feel less depressed. Also, even though a person may have problems with depression, sometimes you can actually be kind of comfortable in that space because you know how to operate within it.": "Chris",
  "It's coming home to roost over the next 50 years or so. It's not just climate change; it's sheer space, places to grow food for this enormous horde. Either we limit our population growth or the natural world will do it for us, and the natural world is doing it for us right now.": "David",
  "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space everything else is opinion. ": "Democritus",
  "Each time I think I've created time for myself, along comes a throwback to disrupt my private space.": "Wole",
  "I am deeply grieved by the loss of the crew of Columbia. I express my sincere condolences to the families and friends of the astronauts. I believe that their names will remain as the bright sparkling stars in the universe and will light the way for those who will follow them on the difficult roads of space exploration.": "Valentina",
  "There are no passengers on spaceship earth. We are all crew.": "Marshall",
  "One of the remarkable things about Donald Trump is that he didn't just beat the Progressive establishment - he also beat the Conservative establishment. Two political tribes that dominated Washington for half a century were defeated in the space of one election campaign.": "Milo",
  "Time travel used to be thought of as just science fiction, but Einstein's general theory of relativity allows for the possibility that we could warp space-time so much that you could go off in a rocket and return before you set out.": "Stephen",
  "For me, architecture is not just creating a space to protect people but to make them dream as well.": "Mario",
  "People need to know that they have all the tools within themselves. Self-awareness, which means awareness of their body, awareness of their mental space, awareness of their relationships - not only with each other, but with life and the ecosystem.": "Deepak",
  "We are aware only of the empty space in the forest, which only yesterday was filled with trees.": "Anna",
  "When I'm home, I like a cozy, comfortable, calming space.": "Stacy",
  "A library is a place that is a repository of information and gives every citizen equal access to it. That includes health information. And mental health information. It's a community space. It's a place of safety, a haven from the world.": "Neil",
  "Whenever I gaze up at the moon, I feel like I'm on a time machine. I am back to that precious pinpoint of time, standing on the foreboding - yet beautiful - Sea of Tranquility. I could see our shining blue planet Earth poised in the darkness of space.": "Buzz",
  "When you're getting ready to launch into space, you're sitting on a big explosion waiting to happen.": "Sally",
  "The thing about hip-hop today is it's smart, it's insightful. The way they can communicate a complex message in a very short space is remarkable.": "Barack",
  "The most important thing we can do is inspire young minds and to advance the kind of science, math and technology education that will help youngsters take us to the next phase of space travel.": "John",
  "There is no such thing as an empty space or an empty time. There is always something to see, something to hear. In fact, try as we may to make a silence, we cannot.": "John",
  "Architecture is how the person places herself in the space. Fashion is about how you place the object on the person.": "Zaha",
  "NASA is an engine of innovation and inspiration as well as the world's premier space exploration agency, and we are well served by politicians working to keep it that way, instead of turning it into a mere jobs program, or worse, cutting its budget.": "Bill",
  "Hey sky, take off your hat, I'm on my way!": "Valentina",
  "The desire to fly is an idea handed down to us by our ancestors who... looked enviously on the birds soaring freely through space... on the infinite highway of the air.": "Wilbur",
  "The modern artist is working with space and time, and expressing his feelings rather than illustrating.": "Jackson",
  "Social media has colonized what was once a sacred space occupied by emptiness: the space reserved for thought and creativity.": "Mahershala",
  "Discipline means to prevent everything in your life from being filled up. Discipline means that somewhere you're not occupied, and certainly not preoccupied. In the spiritual life, discipline means to create that space in which something can happen that you hadn't planned or counted on.": "Henri",
  "The International Space Station is a phenomenal laboratory, an unparalleled test bed for new invention and discovery. Yet I often thought, while silently gazing out the window at Earth, that the actual legacy of humanity's attempts to step into space will be a better understanding of our current planet and how to take care of it.": "Chris",
  "It is far better to grasp the universe as it really is than to persist in delusion, however satisfying and reassuring.": "Carl",
  "Great industries are never made from single companies. There is room in space for a lot of winners.": "Jeff",
  "And as a writer, one of the things that I've always been interested in doing is actually invading your comfort space. Because that's what we're supposed to do. Get under your skin, and make you react.": "Stephen",
  "Under a dictatorship, a nation ceases to exist. All that remains is a fiefdom, a planet of slaves regimented by aliens from outer space.": "Wole",
  "The stars don't look bigger, but they do look brighter.": "Sally",
  "We won't sit idly by when a crime is committed in the real world. So why should we when it happens in cyber space?": "Max",
  "What can we gain by sailing to the moon if we are not able to cross the abyss that separates us from ourselves? This is the most important of all voyages of discovery, and without it, all the rest are not only useless, but disastrous.": "Thomas",
  "I love the desert and its incomparable sense of space.": "Robyn",
  "When friendship disappears then there is a space left open to that awful loneliness of the outside world which is like the cold space between the planets. It is an air in which men perish utterly.": "Hilaire",
  "Architecture is basically the design of interiors, the art of organizing interior space.": "Philip",
  "One in 200 stars has habitable Earth-like planets surrounding it - in the galaxy, half a billion stars have Earth-like planets going around them - that's huge, half a billion. So when we look at the night sky, it makes sense that someone is looking back at us.": "Michio",
  "Pleasure is a shadow, wealth is vanity, and power a pageant; but knowledge is ecstatic in enjoyment, perennial in frame, unlimited in space and indefinite in duration.": "DeWitt",
  "I think that the ideal space must contain elements of magic, serenity, sorcery and mystery.": "Luis",
  "Yosemite Valley, to me, is always a sunrise, a glitter of green and golden wonder in a vast edifice of stone and space.": "Ansel",
  "We judge on the basis of what somebody looks like, skin color, whether we think they're beautiful or not. That space on the Internet allows you to converse with somebody with none of those things involved.": "bell",
  "Trees go wandering forth in all directions with every wind, going and coming like ourselves, traveling with us around the sun two million miles a day, and through space heaven knows how fast and far!": "John",
  "I am formless and everywhere. I am in everything. I am in everything and beyond. I fill all space. All that you see, taken together, is Myself. I do not shake or move.": "Sai",
  "The stars, that nature hung in heaven, and filled their lamps with everlasting oil, give due light to the misled and lonely traveller.": "John",
  "Space Mountain may be the oldest ride in the park, but it has the longest line.": "Ric",
  "The important achievement of Apollo was demonstrating that humanity is not forever chained to this planet and our visions go rather further than that and our opportunities are unlimited.": "Neil",
  "Planets move in ellipses with the Sun at one focus.": "Johannes",
  "Technology has moved away from sharing and toward ownership. This suits software and hardware companies just fine: They create new, bloated programs that require more disk space and processing power. We buy bigger, faster computers, which then require more complex operating systems, and so on.": "Douglas",
  "What we observe as material bodies and forces are nothing but shapes and variations in the structure of space.": "Erwin",
  "The quicker we humans learn that saving open space and wildlife is critical to our welfare and quality of life, maybe we'll start thinking of doing something about it.": "Jim",
  "There's a lot to love about America - freedom, the melting pot of diversity, individualism - all attractive concepts, especially to an introvert. In fact, the introverts were probably the first to feel crowded in England and to daydream about all the space they would find in the New World. Peace! Quiet!": "Laurie",
  "Things are beautiful or ugly only in time and space. The new man's vision being liberated from these two factors, all is unified in one unique beauty.": "Piet",
  "Space only becomes ordinary when the frontier is no longer being breached.": "Neil",
  "The stars look the same from night to night. Nebulae and galaxies are dully immutable, maintaining the same overall appearance for thousands or millions of years. Indeed, only the sun, moon and planets - together with the occasional comet, asteroid or meteor - seem dynamic.": "Seth",
  "I think we live in a world where the most important thing is daily life: sharing a space with your family, making meals, being with your people. It's not only the idea of privacy, it's the beauty of the moment, at a time in the world when everything goes really fast - too fast.": "Ana",
  "I can't deal with someone wanting to take a relationship backward or needing space or cheating on you. It's a conscious thing it's a common-sense thing. ": "Taylor",
  "Every bit of me is devoted to love and art. And I aspire to try to be a teacher to my young fans who feel just like I felt when I was younger. I just felt like a freak. I guess what I'm trying to say is I'm trying to liberate them, I want to free them of their fears and make them feel that they can make their own space in the world.": "Lady",
  "I would rather be a superb meteor, every atom of me in magnificent glow, than a sleepy and permanent planet.": "Jack",
  "In spite of the opinions of certain narrow-minded people, who would shut up the human race upon this globe, as within some magic circle it must never outstep, we shall one day travel to the moon, the planets, and the stars, with the same facility, rapidity, and certainty as we now make the voyage from Liverpool to New York!": "Jules",
  "The world, when you look at it, it just can't be random. I mean, it's so different than the vast emptiness that is everything else, and even all the other planets we've seen, at least in our solar system, none of them even remotely resemble the precious life-giving nature of our own planet.": "Chris",
  "In awe, I watched the waxing moon ride across the zenith of the heavens like an ambered chariot towards the ebony void of infinite space wherein the tethered belts of Jupiter and Mars hang, for ever festooned in their orbital majesty. And as I looked at all this I thought... I must put a roof on this toilet.": "Les",
  "When all of us are acknowledged as the human equals that we really are, there will be no space left for bullying. It will no longer be wrong to choose one thing over another.": "Jason",
  "All architecture is shelter, all great architecture is the design of space that contains, cuddles, exalts, or stimulates the persons in that space.": "Philip",
  "If I go into the place in myself that is love, and you go into the place in yourself that is love, we are together in love. Then you and I are truly in love, the state of being love. That's the entrance to Oneness. That's the space I entered when I met my guru.": "Ram",
  "The space shuttle was often used as an example of why you shouldn't even attempt to make something reusable. But one failed experiment does not invalidate the greater goal. If that was the case, we'd never have had the light bulb.": "Elon",
  "Doing Saturday Night Live definitely affects my relationship with my girlfriend and with my family, because you feel so much pressure to do well that night. But I think everyone's grown to accept that and so they give me my space at the show.": "Adam",
  "Sometimes siblings can get in each other's space.": "Gisele",
  "Space is big. You just won't believe how vastly, hugely, mind-bogglingly big it is. I mean, you may think it's a long way down the road to the drug store, but that's just peanuts to space.": "Douglas",
  "The superior man does not, even for the space of a single meal, act contrary to virtue. In moments of haste, he cleaves to it. In seasons of danger, he cleaves to it.": "Confucius",
  "Personality is the glitter that sends your little gleam across the footlights and the orchestra pit into that big black space where the audience is.": "Mae",
  "For me, California is all about rest, relaxation, space.": "Karen",
  "I know how to learn anything I want to learn. I absolutely know that I could learn how to fly the space shuttle because someone else knows how to fly it, and they put it in a book. Give me the book, and I do not need somebody to stand up in front of the class.": "Will",
  "Wilderness trails constitute a rare space in America marked by economic diversity. Lawyers and construction workers get bitten by the same mosquitoes and sip from the same streams; there are none of the usual signals about socioeconomic status, for most hikers are in shorts and a T-shirt and enveloped by an aroma that would make a skunk queasy.": "Nicholas",
  "If the Earth gets hit by an asteroid, it's game over. It's control-alt-delete for civilization.": "Bill",
  "When time and space and change converge, we find place. We arrive in Place when we resolve things. Place is peace of mind and understanding. Place is knowledge of self. Place is resolution.": "Abdullah",
  "I believe that architecture, as anything else in life, is evolutionary. Ideas evolve; they don't come from outer space and crash into the drawing board.": "Bjarke",
  "It's a very sobering feeling to be up in space and realize that one's safety factor was determined by the lowest bidder on a government contract.": "Alan",
  "I won't say that I'm an agnostic, since agnosticism maintains that one cannot know... but I'm not averse to the idea of some intelligence or some organizing force that set up the initial conditions of the universe in such a way that ultimately generated stars, planets and life.": "B.",
  "Who among us has never looked up into the heavens on a starlit night, lost in wonder at the vastness of space and the beauty of the stars?": "Jeb",
  "When you get into your car, shut the door and be there for just half a minute. Breathe, feel the energy inside your body, look around at the sky, the trees. The mind might tell you, 'I don't have time.' But that's the mind talking to you. Even the busiest person has time for 30 seconds of space.": "Eckhart",
  "I felt the most intense pleasure in piercing the stone in order to make an abstract form and space quite a different sensation from that of doing it for the purpose of realism. ": "Barbara",
  "The people who are doing the work are the moving force behind the Macintosh. My job is to create a space for them, to clear out the rest of the organization and keep it at bay.": "Steve",
  "The human brain now holds the key to our future. We have to recall the image of the planet from outer space: a single entity in which air, water, and continents are interconnected. That is our home.": "David",
  "Sorry I have no space left for advice. Just do it. ": "Donald",
  "Creative experimentation propels our culture forward. That our stories of innovation tend to glorify the breakthroughs and edit out all the experimental mistakes doesn't mean that mistakes play a trivial role. As any artist or scientist knows, without some protected, even sacred space for mistakes, innovation would cease.": "Evgeny",
  "For NASA, space is still a high priority.": "Dan",
  "Oh, don't let's ask for the moon. We've already got the stars.": "Bette",
  "I am sorry to say that there is too much point to the wisecrack that life is extinct on other planets because their scientists were more advanced than ours.": "John",
  "After one look at this planet any visitor from outer space would say 'I want to see the manager.'": "William",
  "The earth together with its surrounding waters must in fact have such a shape as its shadow reveals, for it eclipses the moon with the arc of a perfect circle.": "Nicolaus",
  "The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.": "Nikola",
  "So most astronauts getting ready to lift off are excited and very anxious and worried about that explosion - because if something goes wrong in the first seconds of launch, there's not very much you can do.": "Sally",
  "Everything has a natural explanation. The moon is not a god, but a great rock, and the sun a hot rock.": "Anaxagoras",
  "I think we are at the dawn of a new era in commercial space exploration.": "Elon",
  "A black hole really is an object with very rich structure, just like Earth has a rich structure of mountains, valleys, oceans, and so forth. Its warped space whirls around the central singularity like air in a tornado.": "Kip",
  "If you put enough smart people together in one space, good things happen.": "Erik",
  "I feel privileged and honored to have flown. It's been a tremendous ride, looking back on the legacy and accomplishments, like the Hubble telescope and the launching of the International Space Station in 1998.": "Alan",
  "I believe and support the feminist movement, but I am not generally interested in considering women's rights in relation to equality with men, or in a competition with men, but rather within their own rights and feminine space.": "Shirin",
  "Architecture is the art of how to waste space.": "Philip",
  "And then when I went to Chicago, that's when I had these outer space experiences and went to the other planets.": "Sun",
  "Size is not a reality, but a construct of the mind; and space a construct to contain constructs.": "Robert",
  "Fifty thousand dollars' worth of cabinets isn't going to make you a better cook; cooking is going to make you a better cook. At the end of the day, you can slice a mushroom in about three inches of space, and you can carve a chicken in a foot and a half. So it doesn't matter how big the kitchen is.": "Tyler",
  "A lot of the moves I make originate from futsal. It's played in a very small space, and the ball control is different in futsal. And to this day my ball control is pretty similar to a futsal player's control.": "Ronaldinho",
  "I work a little bit like a sculptor. When I start, my first idea for a building is with the material. I believe architecture is about that. It's not about paper, it's not about forms. It's about space and material.": "Peter",
  "Starbucks was founded around the experience and the environment of their stores. Starbucks was about a space with comfortable chairs, lots of power outlets, tables and desks at which we could work and the option to spend as much time in their stores as we wanted without any pressure to buy. The coffee was incidental.": "Simon",
  "I grew up in New Mexico, and the older I get, I have less need for contemporary culture and big cities and all the stuff we are bombarded with. I am happier at my ranch in the middle of nowhere watching a bug carry leaves across the grass, listening to silence, riding my horse, and being in open space.": "Tom",
  "Before 1915, space and time were thought of as a fixed arena in which events took place, but which was not affected by what happened in it. Space and time are now dynamic quantities... space and time not only affect but are also affected by everything that happens in the universe.": "Stephen",
  "Profound subject matter can be encompassed in small space - for proof, look at any sonnet by Shakespeare!": "Cynthia",
  "Most of us were probably less than immaculately honest as teenagers; it's practically encoded into adolescence that you savor your secrets, dress in disguise, carve out some space for experiments and accidents and all the combustible lab work of becoming who you are.": "Nancy",
  "Space travel for everyone is the next frontier in the human experience.": "Buzz",
  "I think about that 'empty' space a lot. That emptiness is what allows for something to actually evolve in a natural way. I've had to learn that over the years - because one of the traps of being an artist is to always want to be creating, always wanting to produce.": "Meredith",
  "But, after all, the aim of art is to create space - space that is not compromised by decoration or illustration, space within which the subjects of painting can live.": "Frank",
  "There are moments of existence when time and space are more profound, and the awareness of existence is immensely heightened.": "Charles",
  "There is no reason to design buildings that are more basic and rectilinear, because with concrete you can cover almost any space.": "Oscar",
  "We have these words 'space' and 'time,' but you can't touch them. They're not objects, they're not things, they go forever. Space and time are really tools of animal sense perception, the way we organize and construct information.": "Robert",
  "The reason we have the stars twinkle at night is because the light is being kind of blurred by the atmosphere around the Earth. That is why the Hubble Space Telescope is so good, because it is above the atmosphere. So it is kind of like looking at the sun from the bottom of a swimming pool, versus looking at the sun above the swimming pool.": "Michael",
  "Designing a station with artificial gravity would undoubtedly be a daunting task. Space agencies would have to re-examine many reliable technologies under the light of the new forces these tools would have to endure. Space flight would have to take several steps back before moving forward again.": "Andy",
  "We all know the sense of comfort of which we are conscious when a good half of the floor space in a room is unencumbered this seems to offer us the agreeable possibility of moving about freely. ": "Maria",
  "The Earth is the cradle of humanity, but mankind cannot stay in the cradle forever.": "Konstantin",
  "You don't have to work for Google, or any of the other firms encouraging staff to pursue personal projects on company time, to use slowness to unlock your creativity. Anyone can do it. Start by clearing space in your schedule for rest, daydreaming and serendipity. Take breaks away from your desk, especially when you get stuck on a problem.": "Carl",
  "Architecture is the will of an epoch translated into space. Living, Changing, New. Not yesterday, not tomorrow, only today can be given form. Only such architecture is creative.": "Ludwig",
  "Nearly everybody I know does something to try to remove herself to clear her head and to have enough time and space to think... All of us instinctively feel that something inside us is crying out for more spaciousness and stillness to offset the exhilarations of this movement and the fun and diversion of the modern world.": "Pico",
  "Now and then, someone is able to look at an empty space, conclude it would be a great place to start a revolution, and bravely go forward.": "Henry",
  "If you are in a spaceship that is traveling at the speed of light, and you turn on the headlights, does anything happen?": "Steven",
  "NASA space scientists have been studying giraffe skin so they can apply what they learn from it to the construction of spacesuits.": "Joanna",
  "If I had a magic wand, I would live in a building in New York, big enough so my friends, my family could all have apartments in it. We'd raise our kids in the same space and have backyard barbecues and get old and fat together.": "Liz",
  "I think a lot of the American people feel more than a little disappointed that the high-water mark for human exploration was 1969. The dream of human space travel has almost died for a lot of people.": "Elon",
  "When you look at the stars and the galaxy, you feel that you are not just from any particular piece of land, but from the solar system.": "Kalpana",
  "At night, when the sky is full of stars and the sea is still you get the wonderful sensation that you are floating in space.": "Natalie",
  "It was a unique childhood, to say the least. My father was born in Patiala to refugee parents and was a part of the Indian Air Force. The talented few amongst the Air Force pilots are made test pilots. Test pilots are best suited to look at the space programme as they are trained to expect the unexpected.": "Kapil",
  "They say any landing you can walk away from is a good one.": "Alan",
  "The black holes of nature are the most perfect macroscopic objects there are in the universe: the only elements in their construction are our concepts of space and time.": "Subrahmanyan",
  "According to String Theory, what appears to be empty space is actually a tumultuous ocean of strings vibrating at the precise frequencies that create the 4 dimensions you and I call height, width, depth and time.": "Roy",
  "If we drive down the cost of transportation in space, we can do great things.": "Elon",
  "I feel like our culture is so good at pulling other people down and being so judgmental, but there's space for all of us to be who we are. There's space for us to celebrate each other and root for each other and not take each other down.": "Tracee",
  "Space exploration is important research to our economic and national defense, and America's space program is a symbol of our success as a scientifically and technologically advanced nation.": "Randy",
  "Strangely, nothing makes me feel tired, fatigued, at all. I've gone days and nights without sleep, and still the mind is in such a positive space it just doesn't make you feel fatigued.": "Aishwarya",
  "Trees bear fruits only to be eaten by others; the fields grown grains, but they are consumed by the world. Cows give milk, but she doesn't drink it herself - that is left to others. Clouds send rain only to quench the parched earth. In such giving, there is little space for selfishness.": "Munshi",
  "The extent of your consciousness is limited only by your ability to love and to embrace with your love the space around you, and all it contains.": "Napoleon",
  "That's what we want to do here at Johnson Space Center. I think what we have always brought to NASA and brought to the country is trying to push the boundaries, trying to go to the next level.": "Ellen",
  "When I was a child, I wanted to... go into space! To go to Mars. I wanted to explore and explore and explore. I wanted to go to the Lost World in South America - I was heartbroken to discover there were no dinosaurs; I still don't accept it.": "Brian",
  "I can't deal with someone wanting to take a relationship backward or needing space or cheating on you.": "Taylor",
  "I have an 'office,' technically. I never use it. I work on a couch in my living room, with my laptop on my lap, looking out the windows. I love space and green things. And I'm an incredibly casual person. I slouch. I close the laptop and just lie on the couch for a while if I need to think. I put my feet up on a table while I type.": "Ramez",
  "As we begin to have landings on the moon, we can alternate those with vertical launch of similar crew modules on similar launch vehicles for vertical-launch tourism in space, if you want to call it that... adventure travel.": "Buzz",
  "While social media skills were once a 'nice-to-have,' accreditation in the space is becoming a requirement for many of these job titles. Hiring managers and job seekers are realizing that printing stacks of resumes is turning passe, and social media is rising as the new way of generating real-time networking opportunities.": "Ryan",
  "Consciousness, rather than being an epiphenomenon of matter, is actually the source of matter. It differentiates into space time, energy, information, and matter. Even though this view is an ancient view, an ancient world view, it is now finding some resonance amongst a few scientists.": "Deepak",
  "The key to creating the mental space before responding is mindfulness. Mindfulness is a way of being present: paying attention to and accepting what is happening in our lives. It helps us to be aware of and step away from our automatic and habitual reactions to our everyday experiences.": "Elizabeth",
  "Sometimes I think we're alone in the universe, and sometimes I think we're not. In either case the idea is quite staggering.": "Arthur",
  "Perhaps, as some wit remarked, the best proof that there is Intelligent Life in Outer Space is the fact it hasn't come here. Well, it can't hide forever - one day we will overhear it.": "Arthur",
  "Our passionate preoccupation with the sky, the stars, and a God somewhere in outer space is a homing impulse. We are drawn back to where we came from.": "Eric",
  "We will build new ships to carry man forward into the universe, to gain a new foothold on the moon and to prepare for new journeys to the worlds beyond our own.": "George",
  "What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that men set foot on the moon but that they set eye on the earth.": "Norman",
  "There is a fifth dimension, beyond that which is known to man. It is a dimension as vast as space and as timeless as infinity. It is the middle ground between light and shadow, between science and superstition.": "Rod",
  "I don't think the human race will survive the next thousand years, unless we spread into space.": "Stephen",
  "Those are the same stars, and that is the same moon, that look down upon your brothers and sisters, and which they see as they look up to them, though they are ever so far away from us, and each other.": "Sojourner",
  "When many astronauts go to space, they see the insignificant size of the earth and vastness of space, and they become very religious, because they have seen the Signs of Allah.": "Cat",
  "Man must at all costs overcome the Earth's gravity and have, in reserve, the space at least of the Solar System.": "Konstantin",
  "Astronauts are very professional and when they're preparing for launch, they prepare for it as the most serious endeavor of our lives.": "Ellen",
  "I'll tell you, being involved in human space flight, it is an emotional endeavor. I think it brings in the highest highs and the lowest lows.": "Ellen",
  "Life science research can be done on multiple platforms. Since we have a very small number of people flying into space, the more people you have, the better.": "Laurel",
  "When you launch in a rocket, you're not really flying that rocket. You're just sort of hanging on.": "Michael",
  "Land on Mars, a round-trip ticket - half a million dollars. It can be done.": "Elon",
  "If you're going to go to the moon, you don't shoot the rocket right at the moon. You have to go at it obliquely.": "Drew",
  "I think the universe is pure geometry - basically, a beautiful shape twisting around and dancing over space-time.": "Antony",
  "I stayed in the astronaut program until 1993. People ask me why I left. I thought I had a lot of things to contribute that would be difficult to do if I stayed. I thought I could have a stronger voice as an advocate for space exploration. So I ended up starting my own technology consulting company.": "Mae",
  "Houston, we've had a problem.": "Jim",
  "Each year, thousands of UFOs are sighted and reported, which is an impressive tally of unidentified aerial phenomena. Surveys show that roughly one-third of the populace believes that at least some of this sky show is due to extraterrestrial spacecraft, here to probe our airspace and, when that proves boring, our bodies.": "Seth",
  "I'd love to go back to space, I don't know any astronaut who doesn't want to.": "Helen",
  "Our life is full of empty space.": "Umberto",
  "The space within becomes the reality of the building.": "Frank",
  "It is only in the world of objects that we have time and space and selves.": "T.",
  "Underwater, I experience space with my body. I'll see a school of fish gathering and moving together and I'll exclaim, 'This is architecture.'": "Antoine",
  "Theatre is a sacred space for actors. You are responsible you are in the driving-seat. ": "Greta",
  "When a young non-white male is stopped and searched at the whim of a police officer, his idea of personal space, privacy and self esteem are shattered, to say nothing of his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment protections. The damage goes deep quickly and stays. Stop & frisk, as well as a tactic, is also an incitement.": "Henry",
  "A bird cannot fly with one wing only. Human space flight cannot develop any further without the active participation of women.": "Valentina",
  "I love building spaces: architecture, furniture, all of it, probably more than fashion. The development procedure is more tactile. It's about space and form and it's something you can share with other people.": "Donna",
  "Space has always been the spiritual dimension of architecture. It is not the physical statement of the structure so much as what it contains that moves us.": "Arthur",
  "We never had books at home, but my dad, seeing how keen I was to read, took me to Islington Library when I was about eight and we pulled out two - a Biggles and a science fiction novel. I never got the ace fighter pilot but fell in love with all things to do with the future and space. Isaac Asimov soon became my guiding star.": "Gary",
  "I lived in Dallas, and it's a big city, but you can jump on any freeway and drive in any direction for about 30 minutes and you are in the country - open space, wide open, very open, nothin' around.": "Stark",
  "I love the ocean, wide-open space and trees, but I'm not a gardener or anything like that. I think I may be, eventually. I was raised in the city, so I don't have that skill set, but my heart is more with the dirt than the concrete. It's an unrequited love with nature - a one-way love affair.": "David",
  "Something I like to do a lot is just sit by water when there's a current and just stare into the water. I don't fish, I don't hunt, I don't scuba, I don't spear, don't boat, don't play basketball or football - I excel at staring into space. I'm really good at that.": "Iggy",
  "I've put a lot of my life into making it possible to fly in space at all.": "Chris",
  "My buildings should have an emotional core - a space which, in itself, has an emotional nice feeling.": "Peter",
  "Most whale photos you see show whales in this beautiful blue water - it's almost like space.": "Brian",
  "Overcrowding in the cities is producing a collective madness in which irrational violence flourishes because man needs more space in which to be than the modern city allows.": "Gore",
  "The perception of the horizon is an earthbound event; all horizons disappear in space, and we are left shorn of the sweet roots that have held us to the earth, challenged to imagine what is truly present just before us, a unified and seemingly limitless universe.": "Eugene",
  "This is a really big space station. We do a lot of various kinds of work here, different kinds of science experiments; we have over 400 different experiments going on at any one time in different areas, from basic science research to medical technology, that hopefully will benefit more people on Earth.": "Scott",
  "God in the beginning formed matter in solid, massy, hard, impenetrable, movable particles, of such sizes and figures, and with such other properties, and in such proportion to space, as most conduced to the end for which he formed them.": "Isaac",
  "In elementary school, I read every single space book in the library about all the planets, about nebulas, about black holes. So for as long as I can remember, I've been just looking up at the stars and wondering what's out there and even what may be looking back at us.": "Sunil",
  "As long as you don't forgive, who and whatever it is will occupy rent-free space in your mind.": "Isabelle",
  "Then I became a mother and it just fills every space, that isn't filled with something else important. It's just like this incredible balloon that blows up and fills life up.": "Thandie",
  "We find them smaller and fainter, in constantly increasing numbers, and we know that we are reaching into space, farther and farther, until, with the faintest nebulae that can be detected with the greatest telescopes, we arrive at the frontier of the known universe.": "Edwin",
  "Why does everyone think the future is space helmets, silver foil, and talking like computers, like a bad episode of Star Trek?": "Tracey",
  "But even in elementary school and junior high, I was very interested in space and in the space program.": "Sally",
  "I think her friends were worried that the bulimia might come back, about some psychological slide, and she was given breathing space to some extent by the media as much as she ever has been.": "Anthony",
  "Usually when I'm out doing stuff, I'm just out in the wild, doing the wild thing. I don't really get a chance to just chill out until I come here, in my creative space.": "Bootsy",
  "Notwithstanding the fact that the most innovative and progressive space we've seen - the Internet - has been the place where intellectual property has been least respected. You know, facts don't get in the way of this ideology.": "Lawrence",
  "Juggling is sometimes called the art of controlling patterns, controlling patterns in time and space.": "Ronald",
  "One day, people will be able to buy tickets to visit space.": "Leroy",
  "I think what's important is to give space to the range of human experience.": "Judy",
  "Part of keeping space open is not to try to choose a form - to spend more time thinking about content, and let form take care of itself.": "Holly",
  "Then finally I said, 'Okay, well, I want to know all the details. I want creative input. I want to be consulted. I want to know what they're doing and who's involved. And I want to see the space.' So they took me to see it, and then I realized it was major! All these red flags on the Rue de Rivoli with my name on them right by the Louvre!": "Kate",
  "I guess something that you love to do, you gotta ease up off it and give it a little space, come back and be fresh to it.": "Mos",
  "Showing young children in these communities, that there are outlets for their feelings, that there is room in a space for their stories to be told, and that they will be applauded - and it's not about ego, it's about connection: that their pain is everybody else's pain.": "Tom",
  "I'm substantially concerned about the policy directions of the space agency. We have a situation in the U.S. where the White House and Congress are at odds over what the future direction should be. They're sort of playing a game and NASA is the shuttlecock that they're hitting back and forth.": "Neil",
  "If I can create some space that people haven't experienced before and if it stays with them or gives them a dream for the future, that's the kind of structure I seek to create.": "Tadao",
  "Graphic Design, which fulfills aesthetic needs, complies with the laws of form and exigencies of two-dimensional space; which speaks in semiotics, sans-serifs, and geometrics; which abstracts, transforms, translates, rotates, dilates, repeats, mirrors, groups, and regroups, is not good design if it is irrelevant.": "Paul",
  "I think size is the most unused quotient in the sculptor's repertoire because it requires lots of commitment and time. To me it's the best tool. With size you get space and atmosphere: atmosphere becomes volume. You stand in the shape, in the zone.": "Michael",
  "If you look at the Earth without architecture, it's sometimes a little bit unpleasant. So there is this basic human need to do shelter in the broadest sense of the word, whether it's a movie theater or a simple log cabin in the mountains. This is the core of architecture: To provide a space for human beings.": "Peter",
  "You learn something out of everything, and you come to realize more than ever that we're all here for a certain space of time, and, and then it's going to be over, and you better make this count.": "Nancy",
  "I always liked the visuals to be choice and at the same time minimalist. And, I love black boxes. After all, that's what theatre is, it's an empty space, and it's both limited and unlimited because the space is the space, but what you can do with people's imaginations is really endless.": "Harold",
  "A journey into space is the greatest adventure I can imagine.": "Sarah",
  "An architect must remember that the people working or living in his building need space - to dream, to be quiet, to find beauty somewhere.": "Christian",
  "The nature of creativity is to make space for things to happen... We can drive it out with our busyness and plans.": "Iain",
  "A piazza is not a plaza. The plaza is the theme park of the piazza the plaza is the commercial version. A piazza is an empty space with no function. This is what Europeans understand. ": "Renzo",
  "I write for myself, and my goal is bringing that world and that experience of black Americans to life on the stage and giving it a space there.": "August",
  "Starbucks is the last public space with chairs. It's a shower for homeless people. And it's a place you can write all day. The baristas don't glare at you. They don't even look at you.": "Mike",
  "The video game market is huge, and the ability to tell stories, and tell different kinds of stories in the gaming space is quickly evolving and changing for the better.": "Jim",
  "An album is a whole universe, and the recording studio is a three-dimensional kind of art space that I can fill with sound. Just as the album art and videos are ways of adding more dimensions to the words and music. I like to be involved in all of it because it's all of a piece.": "Bat",
  "When we look out into space, we're looking back in time; the light from a galaxy a billion light-years away, for instance, will take a billion years to reach us. It's an amazing thing. The history is there for us to see. It's not mushed up like the geologic record of Earth. You can just see it exactly as it was.": "Margaret",
  "Superconductivity helped broaden my professional phase space. When I started my work, it was already known that magnetic fields could quench superconductivity. I found that the transition was not continuous, that superconductivity was initially enhanced in the presence of magnetic fields, then it would suddenly fall off.": "Mildred",
  "The way I choose to live my own life rates time and space as real luxuries.": "Ben",
  "Poetry, I feel, is a tyrannical discipline. You've got to go so far so fast in such a small space; you've got to burn away all the peripherals.": "Sylvia",
  "When we're in that kind of childish space, we're more genuine and feel more comfortable with our friends.": "Evan",
  "Some people think happiness is a luxury, but it's a necessity. You need to make space for it in your life.": "Christie",
  "In Sweden, there's a lot of talk of gender equality. That discussion isn't as prevalent in the U.S. I feel that successful American women are tougher than Swedish women - they create their space.": "Joel",
  "Science sent the Hubble telescope out into space, so it could capture light and the absence thereof, from the very beginning of time. And the telescope really did that. So now we know that there was once absolutely nothing, such a perfect nothing that there wasn't even nothing or once.": "Kurt",
  "The promise of any artwork is that it can hold us - viewer and maker - in a conflicted or contestable space, without real-world injury or loss.": "Kara",
  "The intuition of the moral sentiment is an insight of the perfection of the laws of the soul. These laws execute themselves. They are out of time, out of space, and not subject to circumstance.": "Ralph",
  "Einstein's gravitational theory, which is said to be the greatest single achievement of theoretical physics, resulted in beautiful relations connecting gravitational phenomena with the geometry of space; this was an exciting idea.": "Richard",
  "When you read a comic book, there's a space between what's happening on the panel and what you have to literally see in your mind. That's not true of movies, where you see everything.": "Ta-Nehisi",
  "In the digital future, texts will be annotated visually, animated and illustrated like never before. The austere 'prayer book' paper that permitted the space for Shepard's illustrations to Pepys' diaries is now being recreated in the digital era.": "Chris",
  "It's a pity I flew only once. A space flight is like a drug - once you experience it, you can't think of anything else.": "Gherman",
  "When we are fully conscious and aware, we actually know when we are about to overreact. When we are mindful, we have the mental space and are aware of when our moods change. When we are mindful, we are aware of when our mental models are being challenged and when expectation does not meet with reality, which can trigger an emotional response.": "Elizabeth",
  "If you go on a journey to Mars and get into deep space, there is several hundred times, maybe 300 times the radiation.": "Scott",
  "I'm not typically a roller coaster person, but Space Mountain I really love out of all roller coasters. That and Splash Mountain.": "Sara",
  "Housework never really bothered me... what bothered me about it later was that it was expected to be your life... when you're a housewife, you are constantly interrupted. You have no space in your life. It isn't the fact that you do the laundry.": "Alice",
  "I have won this lottery. It's a gigantic lottery, and it's called Amazon.com. And I'm using my lottery winnings to push us a little further into space.": "Jeff",
  "It doesn't matter at all for me that I work in hospital or anywhere with limited space. Every day, I'm creating new works with all my might.": "Yayoi",
  "We were talking about the space between us all and the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion. Never glimpse the truth - then it's far too late when they pass away.": "George",
  "No, I think most astronauts recognize that the space shuttle program is very high-risk, and are prepared for accidents.": "Sally",
  "There was a space program before there was integrated circuits.": "Jack",
  "Realizing this, I knew that the actual space of a room could be broken down and played with by planting illusions of real light (electric light) at crucial junctures in the room's composition.": "Dan",
  "One likes to think that one anticipates changes in the spaces we inhabit, and our ideas about space.": "Jasper",
  "But a city is more than a place in space, it is a drama in time.": "Patrick",
  "I think the answer of course is that space and time are not these hard external objects. Again we're, scientists have been building from one side of nature (physics) without considering the other side (life in consciousness). Neither side exists without the other. They cannot be divorced from one another or else there is no reality.": "Robert",
  "Today, we are on a path of decay. We are seeing the book close on five decades of accomplishment as the leader in human space exploration.": "Eugene",
  "My parents, and librarians along the way, taught me about the space between words; about the margins, where so many juicy moments of life and spirit and friendship could be found. In a library, you could find miracles and truth and you might find something that would make you laugh so hard that you get shushed, in the friendliest way.": "Anne",
  "On paper, being good sounds great but a lot depends on the atmosphere of the workplace or community we live in. We tend to become good or bad depending on the cues sent out within a particular space.": "Alain",
  "Sooner or later, I hate to break it to you, you're gonna die, so how do you fill in the space between here and there? It's yours. Seize your space.": "Margaret",
  "In an endless jungle of websites with text-based content, a beautiful image with a lot of space and colour can be like walking into a clearing. It's a relief.": "David",
  "A monkey is unaware that atoms exist. Likewise, our brainpower may not stretch to the deepest aspects of reality. The bedrock nature of space and time, and the structure of our entire universe, may remain 'open frontiers' beyond human grasp.": "Martin",
  "If you want poets in space, you'll have to wait.": "Buzz",
  "That sacred space of conscience where you can exercise your rights in terms of religious freedom and deeply-held, reasonable beliefs is the core of human dignity. In fact, that's the basis for civilization itself. And when you lose that fundamental principle... you have no basis on which to build.": "Jeff",
  "What Alexander Graham Bell thought up occupied less space than a flower vase. Now it's so small that I have to search all my pockets to discover I've received a spam text.": "P.",
  "If you're going to lead a space frontier, it has to be government; it'll never be private enterprise. Because the space frontier is dangerous, and it's expensive, and it has unquantified risks. And under those conditions, you cannot establish a capital-market evaluation of that enterprise. You can't get investors.": "Neil",
  "I've led a life of such structured discipline and always had a goal in mind of knowing what I was doing, from West Point to the Air Force combat, MIT, looking for new things to study and get involved in. And then I got into the space program, and how disciplined can you get?": "Buzz",
  "If we can conquer space, we can conquer childhood hunger.": "Buzz",
  "Space and light and order. Those are the things that men need just as much as they need bread or a place to sleep.": "Le",
  "I'm always involved with the Aerospace Program and NASA and Goddard Space Flight Center. And if kids feel so inclined, they can log onto NASA and the Optimus Prime Spinoff Award, which we present every year to some of the brilliant young minds that are taking up into the academics of space, science, technology, math.": "Peter",
  "That great Cathedral space which was childhood.": "Virginia",
  "I believe that architecture is fundamentally a public space where people can gather and communicate, think about the history, think about the lives of human beings, or the world.": "Tadao",
  "Cinema is a thankless industry where sometimes to appear on the cinematic scenery is a thing for late bloomers and people who are very patient. The places are accounted, and the space is often unwelcoming. Money is rare, and independent voices are muted by the almost complete absence of risk takers.": "Xavier",
  "If we want to travel into the future, we just need to go fast. Really fast. And I think the only way we're ever likely to do that is by going into space.": "Stephen",
  "When it comes to social media, there are just times I turn off the world, you know. There are just some times you have to give yourself space to be quiet, which means you've got to set those phones down.": "Michelle",
  "My expertise is the space program and what it should be in the future based on my experience of looking at the transitions that we've made between pre-Sputnik days and getting to the moon.": "Buzz",
  "Sites need to be able to interact in one single, universal space.": "Tim",
  "On Earth, men and women are taking the same risks. Why shouldn't we be taking the same risks in space?": "Valentina",
  "There is just one thing I can promise you about the outer-space program - your tax-dollar will go further.": "Wernher",
  "I acknowledge the privilege of being alive in a human body at this moment, endowed with senses, memories, emotions, thoughts, and the space of mind in its wisdom aspect.": "Alex",
  "The people you see in Nigeria today have always lived as neighbors in the same space for as long as we can remember. So it's a matter of settling down, lowering the rhetoric, the level of hostility in the rhetoric is too high.": "Chinua",
  "Once you've been in space, you appreciate how small and fragile the Earth is.": "Valentina",
  "What we call the 'world' and the 'universe' is only one frequency range in an infinite number sharing the same space. The interdimensional entities I write about are able to move between these frequencies or dimensions and manipulate our lives.": "David",
  "Space exploration and experimentation are critically valuable to our nation. I know of no better way to honor those seven who sacrificed their lives than to recommit ourselves to defend and enhance America's important strategies in space.": "Rob",
  "Before we had airplanes and astronauts, we really thought that there was an actual place beyond the clouds, somewhere over the rainbow. There was an actual place, and we could go above the clouds and find it there.": "Barbara",
  "In a modern loft, you can't just fill a space with furniture. Each piece has to be perfect.": "Nate",
  "Painting is the most magical of mediums. The transcendence is truly amazing to me every time I go to a museum and I see how somebody figured another way to rub colored dirt on a flat surface and make space where there is no space or make you think of a life experience.": "Chuck",
  "Living in a rural setting exposes you to so many marvelous things - the natural world and the particular texture of small-town life, and the exhilarating experience of open space.": "Susan",
  "Architecture is about public space held by buildings.": "Richard",
  "As an architect, you have to provide a shelter to enjoy art. And you have to love art. It's like when you make a concert hall. You must love music. This is the reason why you make the space, to enjoy music - making a space for art is the same thing.": "Renzo",
  "The rhythm of relations of color and size makes the absolute appear in the relativity of time and space.": "Piet",
  "We are not going to be able to operate our Spaceship Earth successfully nor for much longer unless we see it as a whole spaceship and our fate as common. It has to be everybody or nobody.": "R.",
  "With 'Acid Rap,' I allowed myself to be really open-minded and free with who I allowed into my musical space. I wanted to make a cohesive product, but I also just want to make a bunch of dope songs inspired by whatever sounds I liked.": "Chance",
  "When I design buildings, I think of the overall composition, much as the parts of a body would fit together. On top of that, I think about how people will approach the building and experience that space.": "Tadao",
  "Looking down the road, space exploration and the benefits it yields - in medicine and information technology - should not be overlooked.": "Bob",
  "Obviously for some people there is a big connection between music and the way you can create a space.": "Zaha",
  "There is good evidence that Venus once had liquid water and a much thinner atmosphere, similar to Earth billions of years ago. But today the surface of Venus is dry as a bone, hot enough to melt lead, there are clouds of sulfuric acid that reach a hundred miles high and the air is so thick it's like being 900 meters deep in the ocean.": "Bill",
  "Architecture must not do violence to space or its neighbors.": "I.",
  "Sending greeting cards to aliens is hardly a new idea. In 2005, Craigslist solicited messages for broadcast to space by a transmitter in Florida, and in 2008, NASA beamed a Beatles song to the North Star (Polaris), on the assumption that any putative Polarians would appreciate the Fab Four's 1960s-genre compositions.": "Seth",
  "Circles create soothing space, where even reticent people can realize that their voice is welcome.": "Margaret",
  "I think space, architectural space, is my thing. It's not about facade, elevation, making image, making money. My passion is creating space.": "Peter",
  "I have a lot of objects in my space, little things, reminders, memories.": "Marc",
  "You look at a herd of cattle and well, they all look the same... but they know. They all have an individual personality, and those personalities change from day to day. They can have their grumpy days and their happy days and their serene days. But it's unpredictable. You can't be off in outer space when you're dealing with animals.": "Chris",
  "For me, playwriting is and has always been like making a chair. Your concerns are balance, form, timing, lights, space, music. If you don't have these essentials, you might as well be writing a theoretical essay, not a play.": "Sam",
  "A just laicism allows religious freedom. The state does not impose religion but rather gives space to religions with a responsibility toward civil society, and therefore it allows these religions to be factors in building up society.": "Pope",
  "As someone who flew two space capsules and twice landed in the ocean, I can attest from personal experience how much logistics work is needed to get you home.": "Buzz",
  "I'm looking forward to coming back, back to Earth, the landing, the views.": "Duane",
  "Mining asteroids will ultimately benefit humanity on and off the Earth in a multitude of ways.": "Peter",
  "I think the human race doesn't have a future if it doesn't go into space.": "Stephen",
  "The universe is a symphony of strings, and the mind of God that Einstein eloquently wrote about for thirty years would be cosmic music resonating through eleven-dimensional hyper space.": "Michio",
  "We have spent billions to go to the moon - we go to this lesser satellite called the moon and say we are in space, but we are in space right now; we just don't feel ourselves to be in space. Some forms of art and some forms of spirituality do give us that sense.": "James",
  "I don't know what you could say about a day in which you have seen four beautiful sunsets.": "John",
  "We travel together, passengers on a little spaceship, dependent on its vulnerable reserves of air and soil, all committed, for our safety, to its security and peace. Preserved from annihilation only by the care, the work and the love we give our fragile craft.": "Adlai",
  "The ultimate aim of all science to penetrate the unknown. Do you realize we know less about the earth we live on than about the stars and the galaxies of outer space? The greatest mystery is right here, right under our feet.": "Walter",
  "I'm really hopeful about the future of space exploration and human spaceflight. Civilization as we know it has been defined by exploration. You know, we need to go off and find out what's around the next corner and what's just beyond what we already know. It's part of our being; it's part of our moral fiber to go off and explore.": "Alan",
  "I'm never going to go to Mars, but I've helped inspire, thank goodness, the people who built the rockets and sent our photographic equipment off to Mars.": "Ray",
  "When a place gets crowded enough to require ID's, social collapse is not far away. It is time to go elsewhere. The best thing about space travel is that it made it possible to go elsewhere.": "Robert",
  "Space exploration promised us alien life, lucrative planetary mining, and fabulous lunar colonies. News flash, ladies and gents: Space is nearly empty. It's a sterile vacuum, filled mostly with the junk we put up there.": "Graham",
  "Sculpture occupies the same space as your body.": "Anish",
  "Find joy and solace in the simple, and cultivate your utopia by feeling the Tao in every cubic inch of space.": "Wayne",
  "Reason is like an open secret that can become known to anyone at any time it is the quiet space into which everyone can enter through his own thought. ": "Karl",
  "The more space and emptiness you can create in yourself, then you can let the rest of the world come in and fill you up.": "Jeff",
  "Well-run libraries are filled with people because what a good library offers cannot be easily found elsewhere: an indoor public space in which you do not have to buy anything in order to stay.": "Zadie",
  "My odyssey to become an astronaut kind of started in grad school, and I was working, up at MIT, in space robotics-related work; human and robot working together.": "Michael",
  "The principal reason for the universe's poker face is that its constituents are far away. Stars careen through space, and galaxies spin at speeds thousands of times faster than a jet plane. But given their distance, you'd need the patience of Job to notice much change in their appearance or position.": "Seth",
  "To the casual observer, the Dropbox demo video looked like a normal product demonstration, but we put in about a dozen Easter eggs that were tailored for the Digg audience. References to Tay Zonday and 'Chocolate Rain' and allusions to 'Office Space' and 'XKCD.' It was a tongue-in-cheek nod to that crowd, and it kicked off a chain reaction.": "Drew",
  "The space program needs a goal, and the goal should be humans to Mars.": "Robert",
  "In my solitude I have pondered much on the incomprehensible subjects of space, eternity, life and death.": "Alfred",
  "It doesn't matter the kind of music, it doesn't matter whether it's a cowboy hat or a yarmulke. I don't care if it's outer space or pop, the spirit is the same.": "David",
  "The rockets and the satellites, spaceships that we're creating now, we're pollinating the universe.": "Neil",
  "I believe that there may be intelligent life on other planets.": "Pat",
  "One thing I probably share with everyone else in the astronaut office is composure.": "Sally",
  "Philosophically, the universe has really never made things in ones. The Earth is special and everything else is different? No, we've got seven other planets. The sun? No, the sun is one of those dots in the night sky. The Milky Way? No, it's one of a hundred billion galaxies. And the universe - maybe it's countless other universes.": "Neil",
  "Don't even try to talk to me when I'm watching the moon. That's my moon, baby.": "Wendelin",
  "Age can be wonderful for red wine, but not for spacecraft.": "Nathan",
  "Sometimes people ask me how difficult the astronaut program was, but being in Sierra Leone, being responsible for the health of more than 200 people, seven days a week, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, at age 26 - that prepared me to take on a lot of different challenges.": "Mae",
  "It bears mentioning that the Milky Way is only one of 150 billion galaxies visible to our telescopes - and each of these will have its own complement of planets.": "Seth",
  "A pedestal is as much a prison as any small, confined space.": "Gloria",
  "When man becomes reconciled to nature, when space becomes his true background, these words and concepts will have lost their meaning, and we will no longer have to use them.": "Michelangelo",
  "If you have autism in the family history, you still vaccinate. Delay it a bit, space them out.": "Temple",
  "Religious ritual is a way of structuring time so that we, not employers, the market or the media, are in control. Life needs its pauses, its chapter breaks, if the soul is to have space to breathe.": "Jonathan",
  "That's what I'm interested in: the space in between, the moment of imagining what is possible and yet not knowing what that is.": "Julie",
  "Most visions of extraterrestrial life are actually steeped in human hubris. The fictional extraterrestrials of 'Star Trek' or a hundred other space operas are less alien than many of my neighbors. And funny, the ones running the place are mostly WASPish men.": "Nathan",
  "String theory envisions a multiverse in which our universe is one slice of bread in a big cosmic loaf. The other slices would be displaced from ours in some extra dimension of space.": "Brian",
  "Some people say they feel very small when they think about space. I felt more expansive, very connected to the universe.": "Mae",
  "From journalism I learned to write under pressure, to work with deadlines, to have limited space and time, to conduct and interview, to find information, to research, and above all, to use language as efficiently as possible and to remember always that there is a reader out there.": "Isabel",
  "Space is not an enterprise that belongs to the U.S. or to Russia or to China - it is a human endeavor and experience. And that's as it should be.": "Scott",
  "I'm perennially intrigued how people who lead largely evidence-based lives can, in a belief-based part of their mind, be certain that an invisible, divine entity created an entire universe just for us, or that the government is stockpiling space aliens in a secret desert location.": "Neil",
  "When we first get to space, we feel sick. Your body is really confused. You're dizzy. Your lunch is floating around in your belly because you're floating. What you see doesn't match what you feel, and you want to throw up.": "Chris",
  "Revealing water in significant quantities on the Moon could truly be a turning point in space exploration.": "Peter",
  "The existence of symmetry laws is in full accordance with our daily experience. The simplest of these symmetries, the isotropy and homogeneity of space, are concepts that date back to the early history of human thought.": "Chen-Ning",
  "Sculpture occupies real space like we do... you walk around it and relate to it almost as another person or another object.": "Chuck",
  "Absolute space, that is to say, the mark to which it would be necessary to refer the earth to know whether it really moves, has no objective existence.": "Henri",
  "I might have lived long enough to learn all this in the long haul, but I would have been just another soul taking up time and space for a long spell before I learned.": "Lou",
  "It's a whole other ball game and I am glad that I fit into that space where, whatever it is that you want to do and you are doing as long as you are happy with it, then you know What the Heck!": "Bootsy",
  "I think I understand something about space. I think the job of a sculptor is spatial as much as it is to do with form.": "Anish",
  "I think the American West really attracts me because it's romantic. The desert, the empty space, the drama.": "Ang",
  "Not that the propositions of geometry are only approximately true, but that they remain absolutely true in regard to that Euclidean space which has been so long regarded as being the physical space of our experience.": "Arthur",
  "Every day sees humanity more victorious in the struggle with space and time.": "Guglielmo",
  "Through space the universe encompasses and swallows me up like an atom through thought I comprehend the world. ": "Blaise",
  "In my writing I am acting as a map maker, an explorer of psychic areas, a cosmonaut of inner space, and I see no point in exploring areas that have already been thoroughly surveyed.": "William",
  "Everyone, red state, blue state, everyone supports space exploration.": "Bill",
  "Spiritual space is lost in gaining convenience. I saw the need to create a mixture of Japanese spiritual culture and modern western architecture.": "Tadao",
  "I had always planned to make a large painting of the early spring, when the first leaves are at the bottom of the trees, and they seem to float in space in a wonderful way. But the arrival of spring can't be done in one picture.": "David",
  "Cyberspace can't compensate for real space. We benefit from chatting to people face to face.": "Jonathan",
  "We have to be plumbers, electricians, construction engineers, or workers, on the space station, but at the same time running a laboratory, being scientists, being the best laboratory assistants we can be. It's all in a bundle; it's very exciting, it's a lot of fun.": "Thomas",
  "With any luck, by the time NASA's space probe hits Pluto, you'll be booking a spaceflight with a privately run suborbital airline.": "Burt",
  "When we developed written language, we significantly increased our functional memory and our ability to share insights and knowledge across time and space. The same thing happened with the invention of the printing press, the telegraph, and the radio.": "Jamais",
  "After Apollo 17, America stopped looking towards the next horizon. The United States had become a space-faring nation, but threw it away. We have sacrificed space exploration for space exploitation, which is interesting but scarcely visionary.": "Eugene",
  "It's not about having a plethora of suits, but having a few good ones. It's all about fit. The contour of your body. If your shoulders are broad, you shouldn't have shoulder pads. If you're not a big man, you shouldn't have extra space. I think it's definitely worth having it properly fitted.": "Trey",
  "I think the human race doesn't have a future if we don't go into space. We need to expand our horizons beyond planet Earth if we are to have a long-term future.": "Lucy",
  "I tend to prioritize emotional realism above the known laws of time and space, and when you do that, it's inevitable that strange things happen. Which can be quite enjoyable, I think.": "Helen",
  "Google the name Prometheus, and see how often it has been given to innovations in many different fields, notably science, medicine and space exploration. The fire he stole can be seen, too, as the spark generating all artistic creativity.": "Neil",
  "The Occupy movement did create spontaneously communities that taught people something: you can be in a supportive community of mutual aid and cooperation and develop your own health system and library and have open space for democratic discussion and participation. Communities like that are really important.": "Noam",
  "Laughter is binary: It either happens or it doesn't. As each joke arrives in the course of a film, the cavernous space of the theater is either filled with joy and laughter or with the quiet of cringing embarrassment. Every time you step to the plate to make a joke, you're going to experience one or the other.": "David",
  "I learned about serif and san serif typefaces, about varying the amount of space between different letter combinations, about what makes great typography great. It was beautiful, historical, artistically subtle in a way that science can't capture, and I found it fascinating.": "Steve",
  "Science fiction was rocket-mad for about 40 years until aerospace hit a brick wall about 1970. I would not write off space colonisation or exploration completely, but we are profoundly ill adapted for going boldly into outer space.": "Charles",
  "My weekends are oases of time and space, where I am able to draw a breath and dive into the stuff I couldn't get to that week - the great article I bookmarked, the friend whose emails I kept dropping, the blog post I'd meant to write on a subject that wasn't timely but was still important.": "Rachel",
  "One of the big things about space exploration is that it is as expensive as it is complicated, and you need all the countries of the world to help if you want to accomplish big goals.": "Ellen",
  "If you take all the money we've spent at NASA since we landed on the moon and you had applied that money for incentives to the private sector, we would today probably have a permanent station on the moon, three or four permanent stations in space, a new generation of lift vehicles.": "Newt",
  "The Infinite cannot be measured. The plan of Nature is so immense, but she has no plan, no scheme, but to go on and on forever. What is size, what is time, distance, to the Infinite? Nothing. The Infinite knows no time, no space, no great, no small, no beginning, no end.": "John",
  "I internalize a lot of thoughts, and sometimes it seems like I'm not listening or totally zoned out, but I'm always on a loop of ideas and song titles. I'm definitely kind of a space cadet, but I'm very laid back.": "Maren",
  "When you write, you put your thoughts in the public space. You get both positive and negative feedback.": "Ravi",
  "You can't be on the cusp of innovation and at the forefront of technology if you're wearing blinders. If you don't have an exploration program where you're exploring your world here on Earth, underwater, and in space, then you're wearing blinders and handicapping yourself.": "Gwynne",
  "Thus the sum of things is ever being reviewed, and mortals dependent one upon another. Some nations increase, others diminish, and in a short space the generations of living creatures are changed and like runners pass on the torch of life.": "Lucretius",
  "Each of us can manifest the properties of a field of consciousness that transcends space, time, and linear causality.": "Stanislav",
  "I don't believe in angels, no. But I do have a wee parking angel. It's on my dashboard and you wind it up. The wings flap and it's supposed to give you a parking space. It's worked so far.": "Billy",
  "There are aspects of being the first woman in space that I'm not going to enjoy.": "Sally",
  "There are several revenue streams that are near and present that could support a private space station, including in-space manufacturing, microgravity research, and tourism - for both individuals and sovereign nation astronauts - and in-space supply logistics.": "Dylan",
  "Grilling is an easy tradition to start at any age! To get started, one only needs a modest investment in equipment and a little bit of outdoor space.": "Barton",
  "I want people to get inspired by public space - their space. People tend to forget about it because they do the daily thing, but putting up these sculptures breaks the routine.": "Florentijn",
  "We stand at the birth of a new millennium, ready to unlock the mysteries of space, to free the Earth from the miseries of disease, and to harness the energies, industries and technologies of tomorrow. A new national pride will stir our souls, lift our sights, and heal our divisions.": "Donald",
  "You have to be there not for the fame and glory and recognition and being a page in a history book, but you have to be there because you believe your talent and ability can be applied effectively to operation of the spacecraft.": "Alan",
  "In so many and such important ways, then, do the planets bear witness to the earth's mobility.": "Nicolaus",
  "If I can get some student interested in science, if I can show members of the general public what's going on up there in the space program, then my job's been done.": "Christa",
  "Rocket science is tough, and rockets have a way of failing.": "Sally",
  "I could have gone on flying through space forever.": "Yuri",
  "Well, I don't think we should go to the moon. I think we maybe should send some politicians up there.": "Ron",
  "Put three grains of sand inside a vast cathedral, and the cathedral will be more closely packed with sand than space is with stars.": "James",
  "The purpose of going to Mars is for humans to first begin to occupy, permanently, another planet in the solar system. The astronauts or pilgrims, whatever you might call them, are going to be very historically unique human beings.": "Buzz",
  "By refocusing our space program on Mars for America's future, we can restore the sense of wonder and adventure in space exploration that we knew in the summer of 1969. We won the moon race; now it's time for us to live and work on Mars, first on its moons and then on its surface.": "Buzz",
  "From the moment of using rocket devices, a great new era will begin in astronomy: the epoch of the more intensive study of the firmament.": "Konstantin",
  "To try to really land a spacecraft really on another world is really difficult, and if we lose that ability, it's going to be heartbreaking.": "Bill",
  "I do believe there is life in outer space. Mathematically, there has to be, and if you believe as I do that there is a creator of the universe, then how can we be so arrogant to believe he created life here and nowhere else?": "Eugene",
  "As a young boy growing up in rural India, most of what I knew of the world was what I could see around me. But each night, I would look at the Moon - it was impossibly far away, yet it held a special attraction because it allowed me to dream beyond my village and country, and think about the rest of the world and space.": "Naveen",
  "In order for us to have a future that's exciting and inspiring, it has to be one where we're a space-bearing civilization.": "Elon",
  "To me, a building - if it's beautiful - is the love of one man, he's made it out of his love for space, materials, things like that.": "Martha",
  "Darkness is to space what silence is to sound, i.e., the interval.": "Marshall",
  "A long life in journalism convinced me many presidents ago that there should be a large air space between a journalist and the head of a state.": "Walter",
  "I used to get quite upset that I'd make friends with a guy or a girl and then within the space of three years we'd move and go and live somewhere else, and you'd have to say goodbye to that person.": "Dominic",
  "Growing Greener doesn't produce money for farmland preservation or open space preservation.": "Ed",
  "I hate it when people slag us off. We had done three tours during 1970 and we finished off feeling we had just about had enough. We had done so much in that short space of time, we were drained.": "John",
  "Any type of operating system that I wanted to be able to hack, I basically compromised the source code, copied it over to the university because I didn't have enough space on my 200 megabyte hard drive.": "Kevin",
  "Yes, I did feel a special responsibility to be the first American woman in space.": "Sally",
  "Science Fiction is not just about the future of space ships travelling to other planets, it is fiction based on science and I am using science as my basis for my fiction, but it's the science of prehistory - palaeontology and archaeology - rather than astronomy or physics.": "Jean",
  "God the Father and God the Son cannot be everywhere present; indeed they cannot be even in two places at the same instant: but God the Holy Spirit is omnipresent - it extends through all space, with all other matter.": "Orson",
  "I don't think there is anything wrong with white space. I don't think it's a problem to have a blank wall.": "Annie",
  "From the beginning I thought about working with the body in movement, the space between the body and clothes. I wanted the clothes to move when people moved. The clothes are also for people to dance or laugh.": "Issey",
  "Space is going to be commonplace.": "Christa",
  "We humans are an extremely important manifestation of the replication bomb, because it is through us - through our brains, our symbolic culture and our technology - that the explosion may proceed to the next stage and reverberate through deep space.": "Richard",
  "The house is in turmoil with records on every space. In the kitchen and in the dining room is covered with records. I don't have a big enough house to accommodate everything.": "Marian",
  "Canada has made a strong commitment as a partner in the International Space Station and, like the other partners, wishes to see the assembly of this unique orbiting laboratory continue.": "Marc",
  "Journalism: an ability to meet the challenge of filling the space.": "Rebecca",
  "In the past, it was only in science fiction novels that you could read about ordinary people being able to go to space... But you laid the foundation for space tourism.": "Nursultan",
  "I've been thinking a lot about space. It was one of those slow-motion realisations how little we are, how far we are from everything else in our solar system. This idea of distance started kind of haunting me. How do you go forth and accomplish things but not end up leaving everything you started out with in the dust?": "Regina",
  "Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, may have had his charms, but he really couldn't be considered hip.": "Alexei",
  "But investment in space stimulates society, it stimulates it economically, it stimulates it intellectually, and it gives us all passion.": "Bill",
  "I just always wanted to be left alone to go into a creative space.": "Randy",
  "I grew up like Huck Finn, always outdoors, exploring, collecting frogs - there was space everywhere. I want my kids to experience that too. I love being outside.": "Josh",
  "Islam is about finding your own space.": "Kareem",
  "Make space in your life for the things that matter, for family and friends, love and generosity, fun and joy. Without this, you will burn out in mid-career and wonder where your life went.": "Jonathan",
  "I don't think I could live with anybody. I had roommates, and it's not for me. I like my space!": "Ashley",
  "There is no scientific reason to think that we, even with space travel, are going to survive as a species for ever, certainly not by biting off the hand that feeds us, which is exactly what we are doing.": "Lynn",
  "I would hate to think I'm promoting sadness as an aesthetic. But I grew up in not just a family but a town and a culture where sadness is something you're taught to feel shame about. You end up chronically desiring what can be a very sentimental idea of love and connection. A lot of my work has been about trying to make a space for sadness.": "Mike",
  "I've always fantasized about being on TV. And I was. Then I fantasized about being in the movies. What could be better than captain of a space ship? I get to ride horses, shoot guns, have adventures.": "Nathan",
  "The kitchen is a sacred space.": "Marc",
  "I loved climbing because of the freedom, and having time and space. I remember coming off Everest for the last time, thinking of Dad and wishing that he could have seen what I saw. He would have loved it.": "Bear",
  "Only one in five children in the U.S. lives within walking distance of a park. Many more lack access to a quality early childhood education that provides ample time and space to play.": "Darell",
  "Technology is supposed to make our lives easier, allowing us to do things more quickly and efficiently. But too often it seems to make things harder, leaving us with fifty-button remote controls, digital cameras with hundreds of mysterious features and book-length manuals, and cars with dashboard systems worthy of the space shuttle.": "James",
  "We have responsibilities for others, not just across space but across time. We have responsibilities to people who came before us. They left us a world of institutions, ideas or possibilities for which we, in turn, owe them something. One of the things we owe them is not to squander them.": "Tony",
  "The urge to miniaturize electronics did not exist before the space program. I mean our grandparents had radios that was furniture in the living room. Nobody at the time was saying, 'Gee, I want to carry that in my pocket.' Which is a non-thought.": "Neil",
  "Religious symbols should be visible in public space, in a dignified and non-provocative manner. Christmas trees here, Jewish menorahs there and, further along, a minaret - these symbols represent human life in all its diversity.": "Tariq",
  "Don't ever let the other stuff get in the way of your inherent skills as a kick-butt storyteller. Move the reader, make them happy and sad and excited and scared. Make them stare into space after they've put the book down, thinking about the tale that's become a part of them.": "James",
  "What is wine? It is the grape present in another form; its essence is there, though the fruit which produced it grew thousands of miles away, and perished years ago. So the object of many a tender thought may be spiritually present, in defiance of space - and fond recollections cherished in defiance of time.": "Samuel",
  "I'm interested in exploring the places where all media meet. As TV, Internet, art, games and movies all start moving towards the same point, I want to be part of inventing that space. I'd like to explore media that are traditionally seen as part of the mainstream but not necessarily utilize mainstream formulas.": "Ryan",
  "While many in the social enterprise space often qualify themselves as 'non-profit,' these organizations should instead treat themselves as 'for-purpose.' These organizations should focus on their mission to create social good, while still treating themselves with the same commitment to rigor and discipline as the best for-profits.": "Adam",
  "An awful lot of England is slowly eroding, in ways that I find really distressing, and an awful lot of it is the hedgerows... We're reaching the point where a lot of the English countryside looks just like Iowa - just kind of open space.": "Bill",
  "Without consciousness, space and time are nothing.": "Robert",
  "I would say that the whole way that I have approached the body is as a space, not a thing - not an object to be improved, idealised or whatever, but simply to be dwelt in.": "Antony",
  "Instead of being a page-turner, 'Moby-Dick' is a repository of American history and culture and the essentials of Western literature. The book is so encyclopedic that space aliens could use it to re-create the whale fishery as it once existed on the planet Earth in the midst of the 19th century.": "Nathaniel",
  "I can go into the wilderness and not see anyone for days and experience a kind of space that hasn't changed for tens of thousands of years. Having that experience was necessary to my perception of how photography can look at the changes humanity has brought about in the landscape. My work does become a kind of lament.": "Edward",
  "Relativity challenges your basic intuitions that you've built up from everyday experience. It says your experience of time is not what you think it is, that time is malleable. Your experience of space is not what you think it is; it can stretch and shrink.": "Brian",
  "For me, the excitement in architecture revolves around the idea and the phenomenon of the experience of that idea. Residences offer almost immediate gratification. You can shape space, light, and materials to a degree that you sometimes can't in larger projects.": "Steven",
  "The farther we peer into space, the more we realize that the nature of the universe cannot be understood fully by inspecting spiral galaxies or watching distant supernovas. It lies deeper. It involves our very selves.": "Robert",
  "I always knew I'd go to space.": "Mae",
  "If I wasn't an actress, I'd be a designer. I love interior design and inventing things that are practical but also beautiful - looking at a space and creating magic.": "Deborra-Lee",
  "Sooner or later, we will face a catastrophic threat from space. Of all the possible threats, only a gigantic asteroid hit can destroy the entire planet. If we prepare now, we better our odds of survival. The dinosaurs never knew what hit them.": "Michio",
  "I always try to give my own albums space in between so I have time to create a new sound and give time for people to miss me. You have to come out fresh and reinvent yourself.": "Akon",
  "Retain the vision for space exploration. If we turn our backs on the vision again, we're going to have to live in a secondary position in human space flight for the rest of the century.": "Buzz",
  "When you take away the phone and e-mail and you don't have a million things to run around to, it allows your mind the space to think more expansively about the things that matter.": "Ewan",
  "All architecture has a public nature, I believe, so I would like to make a public space.": "Tadao",
  "Painting is a lie. It's the most magic of all media, the most transcendent. It makes space where there is no space.": "Chuck",
  "The behavior of the crowd at Churchill Downs is like 100,000 vicious Hyenas going berserk all at once in a space about the size of a 777 jet or the White House lawn.": "Hunter",
  "Evolution doesn't care whether you believe in it or not, no more than gravity does. I want to rekindle excitement over what we've achieved as a species with the space program. We can't afford to regress back to the days of superstition.": "Seth",
  "When I return to the writing process after being away from it for a while, the first part of it always is being honest with myself: What am I into right now? Is it rock bands and guitars, is it noise, is it dance beats and electronics? Is it space, is it clutter?": "Trent",
  "Karma is only in space time and causality. Your real self resides non-locally.": "Deepak",
  "One has a responsibility to clean up one's space and make it livable as far as one's own resources go. That includes not only material resources, but psychological resources: the commitment of time and a portion of your mind to something when you'd rather be doing something else.": "Wole",
  "The first time I drew a Superman story was 'For Tomorrow' with Brian Azzarello in 2004. It didn't really hit me how important it was until I drew a scene early-on in the book that featured Superman crossing paths with a giant, intergalactic space armada.": "Jim",
  "I've always thought it was important not to attach too much superstition to the space where you're writing, because once you get into the mindset that you can only do it a certain way in a certain place, your creativity can get blocked.": "Sadie",
  "I'm happy that I have my family, and I'm happy that I had Virginia, where I grew up, to retreat to any time I felt overwhelmed. Whenever there were times when I felt like the rug was being pulled out from under me and I was floating in this crazy space, I would stop and go back to that neighborhood and realize nothing's changed, really.": "Dave",
  "Equality and separation cannot exist in the same space.": "Jason",
  "It's true that I love to connect with my fans on the social networking sites, but I try not to go overboard, ever. I just give people a peek into my mind space, but never bombard them with my tweets.": "A.",
  "Your billion-dollar ideas don't show up in the middle of dramatic distraction. They show up when you have the business and personal discipline to make space for your creative mind to flourish.": "Robin",
  "What's a space elevator? Simply described, it's a thin ribbon, about 3 feet wide and 60 thousand miles long, stretching upwards from the surface of the Earth. The lower end is bolted to a heavy anchor (think of an oil drilling platform), and the top is capped with a counterweight.": "Seth",
  "A factory that can turn carbon nanotubes into a sheet a yard wide and long enough to stretch one-fourth of the way to the moon is not something you'll find at your local industrial park. That's the show-stopper for the space elevator. The ribbon.": "Seth",
  "Consider: The human genome consists of about 3.3 billion base pairs. Since there are only four types of pair, that amounts to 0.8 gigabytes of information, or about what you can fit on a CD. With a microwave radio transmitter, you could beam that amount of information into space in a few minutes, and have it travel to anyone at light speed.": "Seth",
  "It is foolish to claim, as some do, that emigration into space offers a long-term escape from Earth's problems. Nowhere in our solar system offers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest.": "Martin",
  "Not even the most secular among us can fail to be uplifted by Christianity's architectural legacy - the great cathedrals. These immense and glorious buildings were erected in an era of constricted horizons, both in time and in space.": "Martin",
  "I am grateful to the motherland and the people. I feel honored to fly into space on behalf of hundreds of millions of female Chinese citizens.": "Liu",
  "When I was super young, I had an Atari and used to play 'Space Invaders.' Then I fell in love with 'Mario Bros.,' 'Sonic the Hedgehog' and 'Yoshi' on Super Nintendo. I was quite a bit of a gamer as a kid when I think about it.": "Amber",
  "Space is not just going up and coming back down again. Space is getting into orbit and being there, living there, establishing a presence, a permanence.": "Buzz",
  "Adaption of the human body in space is not yet mastered. As soon as you hit space, you feel your body is going through a period of mutation. There's no blood in your head; you have a hard time swallowing. We're not born to naturally be in space.": "Guy",
  "Growing up, when I was at live shows, I was always hoping someone would come out on stage and say, 'The guitarist is sick and couldn't make it... does anybody know how to play all the songs?' That was always my little dream. It was a massively inspiring thing to be in a space with live shows.": "James",
  "At East Side Jews, we can take a risk because it isn't all about the rules. I started it to create a space for all those people who wouldn't go to temple because they were scared of getting the rules wrong.": "Jill",
  "Having recorded his first album, 'Tapestry,' in 1969, in Berkeley, California, during the student riots, McLean, a native New Yorker, became a kind of weather vane for what he called the 'generation lost in space.'": "Douglas",
  "Redwood time moves at a more stately pace than human time. To us, when we look at a redwood tree, it seems to be motionless and still, and yet redwoods are constantly in motion, moving upward into space, articulating themselves and filling redwood space over redwood time, over thousands of years.": "Richard",
  "What brought mass innovation to a nation was not scientific advances - its own or others' - but 'economic dynamism': the desire and the space to innovate.": "Edmund",
  "My office has two buildings that function like the right and left sides of the brain. There's a room where everything is being edited for an upcoming project, but you can pull out of that into a tranquil space to work in a different, more solitary medium. It's an architectural unfolding of the process instead of just one chaotic structure.": "Doug",
  "Diamond, for all its great beauty, is not nearly as interesting as the hexagonal plane of graphite. It is not nearly as interesting because we live in a three-dimensional space, and in diamond, each atom is surrounded in all three directions in space by a full coordination.": "Richard",
  "We don't do laundry because that requires a lot of water, and water's at a premium up here. Plus, it'd be pretty complicated, I think, to make a space washer, although I guess you could do it.": "Scott",
  "People do really well on space missions, but it's the physiological, the medical stuff, the stuff like radiation, loss of bone mass and muscle mass and density. It's those things that we need to figure out.": "Scott",
  "Tone is somewhat totalising in that, once I locate it, it tells me what kind of syntax to use, what word choices to make, how much white space to leave on the page, what sentence length, what the rhythmic patterning will be. If I can't find the tone, I sometimes try narrating through the point of view of someone else.": "Rachel",
  "The best space movie in my view is 'Apollo 13.' That's just the way it happened.": "John",
  "I think maths is the root of everything. If we understood every area of math, it would lead to improving our sense of science, physics, engineering, space travel... all those great things. Maths is a backbone for it.": "Matt",
  "I start from one point and go as far as possible. But, unfortunately, I never lose my way. I 'localize,' which is to say that I think always in a given space. I rarely think of the whole of a solo, and only very briefly. I always return to the small part of the solo that I was in the process of playing.": "John",
  "I pray, read the word, and then creative stuff happens here. Problem-solving and all of that comes into that space. So 'Da Box' actually represents my sanctuary and that time. I might look trapped in a box, but I'm actually more free in that box than anyone on the outside looking in or in any other space in my life.": "Andra",
  "Anything that stimulates the public's imagination about the nobility and the importance of space exploration is something that I'm very excited to be a part of.": "Ron",
  "I loved all of the 'Zenon' movies. Those were my jam mostly because of the fashion. I loved something about the space buns and the weird neon colors. I couldn't just wear that in real life because people would look weirdly at me, but maybe at a party or something.": "Sabrina",
  "'2001: A Space Odyssey' is a movie that really impressed me as a teenager. And also 'Blade Runner.' And 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' is also one of my favorites. I'm always looking for sci-fi material, and it's difficult to find original and strong material that's not just about weaponry.": "Denis",
  "I've always been interested in arrival, and coming to a space, and even to looking back at where you were.": "James",
  "So many times, when you're doing a job, you feel like you're a nuisance at times to people, intruding on their space when you ask them questions; maybe they don't want to deal with you at the time. And now, it's, 'Hey, welcome, where's Craig?' Whereas, now, it's kind of different.": "Craig",
  "Most Jupiter-sized planets orbit the mother star in a highly elliptical orbit. This means they will often cross the orbit of any Earth-like planet and fling it into outer space, making life impossible. But our Jupiter travels in a near-perfect circular orbit, preventing a collision with any Earth-like planet, making life possible.": "Michio",
  "On Earth, men are seen as superior because of their physical strength, but it means nothing in space, where there is no gravity.": "Yi",
  "If you ask me what's harder, being famous or flying to space, I'd say fame is much harder.": "Yi",
  "I have a weird thing - if I can't see where all the walls in my house are, I get a little bit freaked out. I think New York has Stockholm Syndrome'd my sense of space and what a house should be.": "William",
  "My mother took my brother and I to a production of 'The Tempest', and it was in this very small - it could have been the basement of a church or a black box. The space was vast, but there were maybe 15 seats in the middle. Ariel came out wearing a nude sparkly thong and spike heels, and the muses had these gossamer see-through gowns on.": "Phillipa",
  "Thor is magical, yes, but it is the magic of reality. His hammer was crafted 'in the heart of a dying star,' but so were you! Most of the atoms that make you up are in fact the innards of a ball of gas in space that got so heavy that it exploded. Stars died so that you could live, as physicist Lawrence Krauss would say.": "Kyle",
  "When I got hired to do 'Guardians,' it was the dream of a lifetime for me. This is what I've been working towards. I've always wanted to create a space adventure, and especially a space adventure with a raccoon. Now that I'm finally able to do it, I created exactly the movie I wanted to make.": "James",
  "From this time on, the universe is built up into an aggregate of permanent objects connected by causal relations that are independent of the subject and are placed in objective space and time.": "Jean",
  "We must admit with humility that, while number is purely a product of our minds, space has a reality outside our minds, so that we cannot completely prescribe its properties a priori.": "Carl",
  "When I was in theater I was forever trying to inhabit a space which puts yourself under the microscope as an actor and your personality and your take on life, but actually through another portal of a character.": "Andy",
  "When I played in Holland, I always tried to lob the goalkeeper. People used to say, 'Oh, you're always only trying to make a nice goal'. But I said, 'Listen, if the goalie is a little bit off his line, how much space do you have on his left or right?' It's not a lot. 'And how much space do you have above him?'": "Dennis",
  "We're not co-sleeping. I'm all for what people want to do in their home, but I need my bed. I'm a terrible sleeper... I toss and turn and flip, and it would just be a disaster if there were a baby there. And I think it's important for a kid to have their own space.": "Busy",
  "A broad trend I'm completely obsessed with is mobile commerce. Like completely. I'm completely convinced that everybody's going to be buying from their mobile devices. Whoever can claim that space or be in that space, I'm very interested in.": "Gary",
  "Music deals with time and timing. It's so magical, but when you get into it, every little sound and every little space between the sounds, it's critical, so critical. And if it's not there, it not only feels wrong, but it ruins things.": "David",
  "I tend to gravitate to the darkest or most obscure part of any venue in an effort to have my own space to experience the music on my own, free from unwanted conversations and other distractions.": "Henry",
  "Vinyl is democratic, as surely as the iPod is fascist. Vinyl is representational: It has a face. Two faces, in fact, to represent the dualism of human nature. Vinyl occupies physical space honestly, proud as a fat woman dancing.": "Adam",
  "It doesn't matter what country or what political system you are from. Space brings you together.": "Valentina",
  "Harlem was a development, a developer's dream and a place where residents had more space and more amenities than ever before. The subway reached 145th street about 1904, and it seemed that Harlem's destiny was to become largely a preserve of successful ethnics relocating and arriving. Then, overnight, the bust took place.": "David",
  "I can't say I've ever had a dream about space or that I ponder it all the time.": "John",
  "If you look at space companies, they've failed either because they've had a technical solution where success was not a possible outcome, they were unable to attract a critical mass of talent, or they just ran out of money. The finish line is usually a lot further away than you think.": "Elon",
  "Space tourism is a logical outgrowth of the adventure tourist market.": "Buzz",
  "A 'farm' today means 100,000 chickens in a space the size of a Motel 6 shower stall.": "P.",
  "Space has always been confusing to politics.": "P.",
  "The words 'Space Age' have a quaint, nostalgic tone - sitting on midcentury modern furniture watching 'The Jetsons.'": "P.",
  "Obama's space policy doesn't differ much from George W. Bush's.": "P.",
  "America has tossed its cap over the wall of space.": "John",
  "Why should man's first flight to the moon be a matter of national competition? Why should the United States and the Soviet Union, in preparing for such expeditions, become involved in immense duplications of research, construction and expenditure?": "John",
  "There are thousands of asteroids whose orbit in the Solar System crosses that of Earth. And we have a little acronym for them - NEOs: near Earth objects. And our biggest goal is to try to catalogue them, so we know in advance if one is going to put us at risk.": "Neil",
  "Space enthusiasts are the most susceptible demographic to delusion that I have ever seen.": "Neil",
  "If you want a nation to have space exploration ambitions, you've got to send humans.": "Neil",
  "I claim that space is part of our culture. You've heard complaints that nobody knows the names of the astronauts, that nobody gets excited about launches, that nobody cares anymore except people in the industry. I don't believe that for a minute.": "Neil",
  "The partisanship surrounding space exploration and the retrenching of U.S. space policy are part of a more general trend: the decline of science in the United States. As its interest in science wanes, the country loses ground to the rest of the industrialized world in every measure of technological proficiency.": "Neil",
  "Space in general gave us GPS - that's not specifically NASA, but it's investments in space.": "Neil",
  "As a scientist, I want to go to Mars and back to asteroids and the Moon because I'm a scientist. But I can tell you, I'm not so naive a scientist to think that the nation might not have geopolitical reasons for going into space.": "Neil",
  "Asteroids have us in our sight. The dinosaurs didn't have a space program, so they're not here to talk about this problem. We are, and we have the power to do something about it. I don't want to be the embarrassment of the galaxy, to have had the power to deflect an asteroid, and then not, and end up going extinct.": "Neil",
  "If the United States commits to the goal of reaching Mars, it will almost certainly do so in reaction to the progress of other nations - as was the case with NASA, the Apollo program, and the project that became the International Space Station.": "Neil",
  "Private enterprise can never lead a space frontier. It's not possible because a space frontier is expensive, it has unknown risks and it has unquantified risks.": "Neil",
  "Whether or not people go into space or serve the space industry, they will have the sensitivity to those fields necessary to stimulate unending innovation in the technological fields, and it's that innovation in the 21st century that will drive tomorrow's economies.": "Neil",
  "I was transformed by picking up a pair of binoculars and looking up, and that's hard to do for a city kid because when you look up you just see buildings - and really, your first thought is to look in people's windows. So to look out of the space - out of living space - and look up to the sky, binoculars go far, literally and figuratively.": "Neil",
  "There are a lot of things you can do in space, and space essentially is unlimited resources. We are climbing over ourselves here looking for the next source of energy. The universe has an unlimited source of energy.": "Neil",
  "There's a lot to do in space. I want to learn more about the greenhouse effect on Venus, about whether there was life on Mars, about the environment in which Earth and the Sun is immersed, the behavior of the Sun.": "Neil",
  "A zero-gravity flight is a first step toward space travel.": "Stephen",
  "Time can behave like another direction in space under extreme conditions.": "Stephen",
  "Perhaps one day I will go into space.": "Stephen",
  "I have wanted to fly into space for many years, but never imagined it would really be feasible.": "Stephen",
  "I don't know how anyone gets anything done in cities. How can you live somewhere like London or New York, when there are 81 things to do every night? Awful. Give me solitude and space any time.": "Douglas",
  "Writing is largely about time, while visual art is largely about space.": "Douglas",
  "I decided at 40 I was wasting entire chunks of my brain and didn't want to blow my one chance on Earth. I'm glad I made that decision. Writing is largely about time, while visual art is largely about space. Sometimes, as with film, you can hybridize, but I think it's basically the space part of my brain wanting equal footing with the time part.": "Douglas",
  "What I'm trying to do is, is to make a significant difference in space flight. And help make space flight accessible to almost anyone.": "Elon",
  "If anyone has a vested interest in space solar power, it would have to be me.": "Elon",
  "It is theoretically possible to warp spacetime itself, so you're not actually moving faster than the speed of light, but it's actually space that's moving.": "Elon",
  "So we originally expected to make about 35 gigawatt hours at the cell level and about 50 gigawatt hours at the module or pack level. Now we are expecting to do about 150 gigawatt hours in the same volumetric space as the original design.": "Elon",
  "The light from the sun breaks through space, bathing our planet as it encircles the sun with life-giving warmth and light. Without the sun, there could be no life on this planet; it would be forever barren, cold, and dark.": "Joseph",
  "The reason that I'm here at all is because of my relationship with my family and their encouragement of me to be a musician and to work hard. As long as I stay there in that space, I can do anything. That's my truth.": "Lady",
  "I like black because it is a vacant space.": "Lady",
  "Your body has space within you that cannot die.": "Wayne",
  "Theater is a space where you cross over from everyday life, because there are real people in that moment moving in front of you - you're being invited to believe in a story and cross that bridge.": "Cate",
  "Losing my daughter was a very serious pain. There was always some empty space in my heart.": "Yoko",
  "I think humans will reach Mars, and I would like to see it happen in my lifetime.": "Buzz",
  "We must still think of ourselves as pioneers to understand the importance of space.": "Buzz",
  "To move forward, what's required is a unified space agenda based on exploration, science, development, commerce, and security.": "Buzz",
  "Everyone who's been in space would, I'm sure, welcome the opportunity for a return to the exhilarating experiences there.": "Buzz",
  "Instead of planning the retirement of the Space Shuttle program, America should be preparing the shuttles for their next step in space: evolving, not shutting them down and laying off thousands of people.": "Buzz",
  "There's no doubt who was a leader in space after the Apollo Program. Nobody came close to us. And our education system, in science, technology, engineering and math, was at the top of the world. It's no longer there. We're descending rather rapidly.": "Buzz",
  "We should've asked China to be a portion of the space station. We should've worked out ways that we can... just give away the technology that we have that puts things up into space, with cooperation up above the atmosphere that's needed to help each other.": "Buzz",
  "I think both the space shuttle program and the International Space Station program have not really lived up to their expectations.": "Buzz",
  "Absolutely the United States should lead in space, for the survival of the United States. It's inspiring for the next generation. If we lose leadership, then we'll be using Chinese capability to inspire Americans.": "Buzz",
  "I came to dedicate my life to opening space to the average person and crafting designs for new spaceships that could take us far from home. But since Apollo ended, such travels were only in our collective memory.": "Buzz",
  "Can you imagine, in 2030, taking a space cruise on the very ship that carried the first human beings to Mars? I can't believe that people wouldn't line up for that possibility.": "Buzz",
  "There are many people talking about access to space and, 'How can we make that cheaper? How can we turn that into a Southwest Airlines versus the big airlines?'": "Buzz",
  "In space, you don't get that much noise. Noise doesn't propagate in a vacuum.": "Buzz",
  "By venturing into space, we improve life for everyone here on Earth - scientific advances and innovations that come from this kind of research create products we use in our daily lives.": "Buzz",
  "Anything we can do in the near future that begins to stimulate the interest of people - seeing somebody down the street have an opportunity to go into space - buoys up the whole neighborhood.": "Buzz",
  "There were about six years when there was not one American who went into space. We shouldn't do that again.": "Buzz",
  "You can never tell when a commercial space venture will suddenly become viable.": "Buzz",
  "It's time to open the space frontier to citizen explorers.": "Buzz",
  "I am excited to think that the development of commercial capabilities to send humans into low Earth orbit will likely result in so many more Earthlings being able to experience the transformative power of space flight.": "Buzz",
  "'Anthony and the Magic Picture Frame' tells it like it really was in America's early space program - the adventure, the risks, and the rewards.": "Buzz",
  "Bringing an asteroid back to Earth? What's that have to do with space exploration? If we were moving outward from there, and an asteroid is a good stopping point, then fine. But now it's turned into a whole planetary defense exercise at the cost of our outward exploration.": "Buzz",
  "Space architectures capable of supporting a permanent human presence on Mars are extraordinarily complex, with many different interdependent systems.": "Buzz",
  "One of the major problems with long-term deep space human flight is the requirement for radiation shielding.": "Buzz",
  "What's aero braking? That's a way to use the gravity and upper atmosphere of Earth to sling shot a ship out either deeper into space, or slow it down to be 'captured' by Earth's gravity.": "Buzz",
  "When I was a kid, politicians wanted to avoid talking about religion if they could. John F. Kennedy couldn't duck the issue, being Catholic and all. So how did he address it? By reminding Americans that religion shouldn't be an issue, that he was concentrating on big things like poverty and hunger and leading the space race.": "Penn",
  "What art offers is space - a certain breathing room for the spirit.": "John",
  "We have teams of people working on electric cars. So you never know - you may find Virgin competing with the Tesla in the car business as we do in the space business.": "Richard",
  "We have one planet in our solar system that's habitable, and that's the Earth, and space travel can transform things back here for the better. First of all, by just having people go to space and look back on this fragile planet we live on. People have come back transformed and have done fantastic things.": "Richard",
  "The mysteriousness and mystique of space is such, that science fiction attempts to tantalize you by telling you a story that could possibly be out there and that's the appeal of science fiction.": "William",
  "In the four years since its launch, Kepler has chalked up 122 new and confirmed planets. It's also caught the scent of nearly three thousand additional objects, of which probably 80 percent or more will turn out to be other-worldly orbs.": "Seth",
  "The math is dead simple: it seems that the frequency of planets able to support life is roughly one percent. In other words, a billion or more such worlds exist in our galaxy alone. That's a lot of acreage, and it takes industrial-strength credulity to believe it's all bleakly barren.": "Seth",
  "I don't think the space station is innovative. Going to the moon was innovative because we had no idea how to do it.": "Peter",
  "There was a period of time during the 'Jagged Little Pill' era where I don't think I laughed for about two years. It was a survival mode, you know. It was an intense, constant, chronic over-stimulation and invasion of energetic and physical literal space.": "Alanis",
  "I'm a little territorial and defensive. I don't like having my space invaded.": "Shia",
  "The wonderful thing about 48 fps is the integration of live action and CG elements; that is something I learned from 'The Hobbit.' We are so used to 24 fps and the romance of celluloid... but at 48 fps, you cannot deny the existence of these CG creations in the same time frame and space and environment as the live action.": "Andy",
  "I remember a specific moment, watching my grandmother hang the clothes on the line, and her saying to me, 'you are going to have to learn to do this,' and me being in that space of awareness and knowing that my life would not be the same as my grandmother's life.": "Oprah",
  "New Yorkers only cross water for visual culture if the water is an ocean. The East River throws us for a huge loop. If we started going to Queens and the Bronx for visual culture, many of our rent, space, and crowding problems would be over indefinitely.": "Jerry",
  "Can space break? I mean the space of art galleries. Over the past 100 years, art galleries have gone from looking like Beaux Arts salons to simple storefronts to industrial lofts to the gleaming giant white cubes of Chelsea with their shiny concrete floors.": "Jerry",
  "The first private space of my own wasn't a dorm room; it was a hotel room in Tulsa, Oklahoma.": "Rob",
  "I am absolutely certain that life can exist in outer space, move around, find a new aqueous environment.": "Craig",
  "The day is not far off when we will be able to send a robotically controlled genome-sequencing unit in a probe to other planets to read the DNA sequence of any alien microbe life that may be there.": "Craig",
  "I think there's a certain space people have decided I occupy - the funny-sidekick thing.": "Zooey",
  "From orphanages to space colonies, it was all shallow but endearingly enthusiastic futurism. Gingrich was the kind of person who read a book or two on something and would then be quite afire as to how this was going to fit into some shining future.": "Molly",
  "Work takes up a lot of my brain space. So when I work, it's one thing. I don't have a lot of time to think about dating.": "Chris",
  "Ye stars! which are the poetry of heaven!": "Lord",
  "A city like London is sociable in a sense that there are people gathering in bars and restaurants, concerts and lectures. Yet you can partake of all these experiences and never say hello to anyone new. And one of the things that all religions do is take groups of strangers into a space and say it is OK to talk to each other.": "Alain",
  "Sadly, semi-consciousness, along with daydreaming, is a capacity that is actively discouraged among children in schools, and our society is much poorer and harsher as a consequence. The value of liminal space and transitional imagination remain personally and culturally undeveloped.": "Michael",
  "Pour a liquid out of its container, and it changes shape, fills the space you give it. If you give children a lot of space, it may surprise you where they'll go and the shape they'll take.": "Nancy",
  "Indeed, there is much in pure humanitarian culture, as opposed to rigid scientific training, which encourages absorption in the affairs of mankind, and more or less indifference to the unfathomed abysses of star-strown space that yawn interminably about this terrestrial grain of dust.": "H.",
  "Favor comes because for a brief moment in the great space of human change and progress some general human purpose finds in him a satisfactory embodiment.": "Franklin",
  "A day will come when other Israelis will be launched into space in the service of science and progress. For them and for us, Ilan Ramon will always be a source of inspiration as Israel's space pioneer, and his memory will be engraved in our hearts forever.": "Ariel",
  "The motions of the comets are exceedingly regular, and they observe the same laws as the motions of the planets, but they differ from the motions of vortices in every particular and are often contrary to them.": "Isaac",
  "It is indeed a matter of great difficulty to discover, and effectually to distinguish, the true motions of particular bodies from the apparent because the parts of that immovable space, in which those motions are performed, do by no means come under the observation of our senses.": "Isaac",
  "Most people are completely unaware of their breath. They violate your space, they have no idea that they have halitosis.": "Larry",
  "I used to consider the listener. But now I'm in a space where, if I'm not inspired, I can't really do the music. I can't feel it.": "Kendrick",
  "Well, I met Frank Sinatra and Bob Dylan in the space of 15 minutes. Frank Sinatra kissed me on the lips. He kissed me on the lips. And then he gave me a filterless cigarette. And then I met Bob Dylan. I came off all lightheaded and had to go sit on his dressing-room steps.": "Kate",
  "As I grew steadily more comfortable in the kitchen, I found that, much like gardening, most cooking manages to be agreeably absorbing without being too demanding intellectually. It leaves plenty of mental space for daydreaming and reflection.": "Michael",
  "There are instances where you're in a space with someone who has been extraordinarily successful, and they don't necessarily connect with you as another person. You can be a prop for them to deliver their stuff, and you're just another element in the scene.": "Mahershala",
  "A father and two sons run Adelphia. It's a cable company. And they took from that company a billion dollars. A billion. Three people - three people took a billion dollars. What were they gonna do, start their own space program? 'Let's send the monkey to Mars, Dad!'": "Lewis",
  "I take the invasion of my personal space very seriously.": "Kid",
  "It's very dangerous to put astronauts on a moon base where there's radiation, solar flares and micro meteorites. It'd be much better to put robots on the moon and have them mentally connected to astronauts on the Earth.": "Michio",
  "Our astronauts, when they go orbiting around the earth, they actually come back slightly younger than a twin that they would have on the planet Earth who was stationary. This is called the twin paradox.": "Michio",
  "Most of us still haven't grasped the fact that everything we commit to the digital space - not just our public blogs and broadcast tweets, but every private text message, email, and voicemail is likely to be stored and accessible. Forever.": "Douglas",
  "Space is almost infinite. As a matter of fact, we think it is infinite.": "Dan",
  "People are scrambling to figure out how they can prolong the life of an album. But as long as the shelf space continues to shrink at retail, there's just no room for them anymore... which is fine with me! I would love to be the next person in country to just release digital singles, but I think we're probably a little ways from that.": "Blake",
  "The moon and other celestial bodies should be free for exploration and use by all countries. No country should be permitted to advance a claim of sovereignty.": "Lyndon",
  "The world is a nested space, and so we have our brain as a person, and people are members of teams, and teams are part of business units, and business units are parts of corporations, and corporations are part of industries, which are part of economies.": "Clayton",
  "There is a project that's underway called the interplanetary Internet. It's in operation between Earth and Mars. It's operating on the International Space Station. It's part of the spacecraft that's in orbit around the Sun that's rendezvoused with two planets.": "Vint",
  "The arts can play a vital role in revitalizing neighborhoods, using and improving vacant space, bringing new jobs and new sense of opportunity, and improving public safety by generating more foot traffic and more eyes on the street.": "Gavin",
  "I find podcasting an enticing space.": "Jason",
  "We collectively have a special place in our heart for the manned space flight program - Apollo nostalgia is one element, but that is only part of it. American culture worships explorers - look at the fame of Lewis and Clark, for example. The American people want to think of themselves as supporting exploration.": "Nathan",
  "Two things I'm obsessed with are the countryside and fields and being in the open space and body parts, so you'll hear me mentioning body parts and human anatomy. I've listened to my songs and I think I am quite visual and I talk about bones and flesh a lot.": "Ellie",
  "Mars is key to humanity's future in space. It is the closest planet that has all the resources needed to support life and technological civilization. Its complexity uniquely demands the skills of human explorers, who will pave the way for human settlers.": "Robert",
  "People make their own fates, and if enough of us make our fate to be space explorers, perhaps we can actually get some space exploration done.": "Robert",
  "Whatever your political leaning, vote. This participation is vital. I feel the same way about issues like the space program, education, the military. The more the public focuses on these things, thinks and forms opinions, I think the better we are as a democracy.": "Ron",
  "All things which have a directing force here in the physical world cease to exist when one arrives in the imaginative world. If, on the physical plane, you imagine yourself to have done something you actually have not done, you will soon be persuaded by the facts of the physical world that this is not so. This is not the case in astral space.": "Rudolf",
  "When we project the specific organization of the human body into the space outside it, then we have architecture.": "Rudolf",
  "By giving material expression to force-forms in space, the Greeks gave divine spiritual beings the opportunity of using these material forms. It is no figure of speech but a fact when we say that gods came down at that time into the Greek temples in order to be among human beings on the physical plane.": "Rudolf",
  "Essentially what's going to determine how you succeed in New York is how people feel about the space, how delicious the food is, how they perceive the value and, most important of all, how they feel treated. My understanding is Stephen Starr is exceptionally good at all of this and his ability to create a transporting experience.": "Danny",
  "Kids today aren't listening to music audio-only. They're picking up a CD and looking at the lyric sheet and wondering why the pictures aren't moving around. Who wants to do that? It's like Bam Bam Flintstone hanging with the dinosaurs vs. Elroy Jetson who's flying around space. If I'm a kid, I wanna be kicking it with Elroy.": "will.i.am",
  "Working away from my husband for long periods is good and bad. It stops us taking each other for granted and gives us space, but I miss him terribly.": "Helen",
  "Every moment is as real as every other. Every 'now,' when you say, 'This is the real moment,' is as real as every other 'now' - and therefore all the moments are just out there. Just as every location in space is out there, I think every moment in time is out there, too.": "Brian",
  "Black holes provide theoreticians with an important theoretical laboratory to test ideas. Conditions within a black hole are so extreme, that by analyzing aspects of black holes we see space and time in an exotic environment, one that has shed important, and sometimes perplexing, new light on their fundamental nature.": "Brian",
  "I believe Britishness is defined not on ethnic and exclusive grounds but through shared values; our history of tolerance, openness and internationalism; and our commitment to democracy and liberty, to civic duty and the public space.": "David",
  "There was a time when I was knocking on doors and concerned with being recognized in dominant culture. I've found a space where the terrain is different, where I'm embraced by people like me, and where I'm building new ways of doing things, as opposed to trying to insert myself in a place that might not be welcoming.": "Ava",
  "Women should try to increase their size rather than decrease it, because I believe the bigger we are, the more space we'll take up, and the more we'll have to be reckoned with.": "Roseanne",
  "The majority of the world is empty space. Empty space, empty space, empty space. All that we see in the world, the life, the animals, plants, people - it's all empty space. That's amazing!": "Chris",
  "In an enclosed space, a camel's breath can change the atmosphere of the room. Not only just the smell, they literally seem to change the atmospheric pressure. It's so disgusting. It's like they have eight stomachs each more rancid then the next and it just comes out of their mouth.": "Steve",
  "I always wanted to be a cowboy, and Jedi Knights are basically cowboys in space, right?": "Liam",
  "When someone is playing drums, they aren't actually moving around a space; they're just moving their arms and limbs. They're stuck behind the drum set. So to film someone playing the drums and make it feel as kinetic as a car chase or a shootout or a battle scene was the challenge.": "Damien",
  "Maybe the search for life shouldn't restrict attention to planets like Earth. Science fiction writers have other ideas: balloon-like creatures floating in the dense atmospheres of planets such as Jupiter, swarms of intelligent insects, nano-scale robots and more.": "Martin",
  "The images of Earth's delicate biosphere, contrasting with the sterile moonscape where the astronauts left their footsteps, have become iconic for environmentalists: these may indeed be the Apollo programme's most enduring legacy.": "Martin",
  "We need to broaden our sympathies both in space and time - and perceive ourselves as part of a long heritage, and stewards for an immense future.": "Martin",
  "Most theorists suspect that space has an intricate structure - that it is 'grainy' - but that this structure is on a much finer scale than any known subatomic particle. The structure could be of an exotic kind: extra dimensions, over and above the three that we are used to (up and down, backward and forward, left and right).": "Martin",
  "The bedrock nature of space and time and the unification of cosmos and quantum are surely among science's great 'open frontiers.' These are parts of the intellectual map where we're still groping for the truth - where, in the fashion of ancient cartographers, we must still inscribe 'here be dragons.'": "Martin",
  "I am involved in the architecture of space.": "James",
  "The commercial space industry is enormous and ripe for disruption.": "Steve",
  "When I was 11, I went to space camp at the Space Center in Texas, near where I grew up. There, I met video-game-industry pioneer Richard Garriott, better known to gamers everywhere as 'Ultima' creator Lord British.": "Steve",
  "I enjoy finding the right word and giving each its full measure, its full space in a sentence.": "Miriam",
  "Bollywood has always pampered heroes and treated actors as second class citizens. But, of late, it has realised that there has to be space for actors who can connect with people.": "Nawazuddin",
  "I've always been a bit of a space geek. I wrote an article years ago about the neutral buoyancy tank, which is this biblically sized pool where they train astronauts. And it was just the coolest thing.": "Mary",
  "Weightlessness was unbelievable. It's physical euphoria: Nothing about you has any weight. You don't realize that you are weighed down all the time by yourself, and your organs, and your head. Your arms weigh down your shoulders. In space simulation, you get to fly like Superman! You're hanging in the air! It's the coolest thing.": "Mary",
  "It says something very deep about humans and our society, something very good about us, that we've invested our time and treasure in building a machine that can fly across three billion miles of space to explore the Pluto system.": "Alan",
  "I'm hopeful that commercial space exploration will takeoff. To really fuel the spaceflight revolution will require an investment of hundreds of billions of dollars a year, and I think that's only going to happen in the commercial sector - if there are large profits to be made.": "Alan",
  "Back in the Seventies, we had a romantic, poetic vision of the future, like it was in the movie '2001: A Space Odyssey.' It felt as if everything was still ahead of us.": "Jean-Michel",
  "We have no right to pick out all that is noblest and fairest in man, to project these qualities into space, and to call them God. We only thus create an ideal figure, a purified, ennobled, 'magnified' Man.": "Annie",
  "There was a lot of the 'Hamilton' experience that was like a locomotive. It was a hurricane, so the apartment often looked like a hurricane. There were clothes and shoes all over. We were getting more things in than we had room for. We had to figure out how to make space for all the blessings and goodness coming toward us.": "Leslie",
  "It's hard because I think I fall into this in-between space where there's something that's innately feminine about me, and there's also something that's kind of androgynous. I carry myself somewhere in between, and I think my music lends itself to that as well.": "Halsey",
  "When I first started YouTubeing, the idea was, 'Oh, YouTube is going to be a stepping stone to get to other places,' and I just totally don't agree with that. I think YouTube is amazing. The digital space is amazing.": "Lilly",
  "I think it's almost a law of nature that there are only certain things that hit an emotive space, and that's what was always special for me about music: it made me feel something.": "Kate",
  "I am aware how difficult is the task to preserve free institutions over so wide a space and so immense a population, but we are blessed with a Constitution admirably calculated to accomplish it. Its elastic power is unequaled, which is to be attributed to its federal character.": "John",
  "I already find pyramids from space. Is there anything cooler than that?": "Sarah",
  "As an actor, our very palette is one of imagination. So it is a walk onto an empty space and then imagine the world beyond it is what we do.": "Rhys",
  "Put two ships in the open sea, without wind or tide, and, at last, they will come together. Throw two planets into space, and they will fall one on the other. Place two enemies in the midst of a crowd, and they will inevitably meet; it is a fatality, a question of time; that is all.": "Jules",
  "Any astronaut can tell you you've got to do everything you can to learn about your life support system and then do everything you can to take care of it.": "Sylvia",
  "I think that autistic brains tend to be specialized brains. Autistic people tend to be less social. It takes a ton of processor space in the brain to have all the social circuits.": "Temple",
  "I wanted a CFO with public company experience; I needed an HR department, new office space, and a board which could help me grow the business. Insight, the private equity firm I chose, helped me with all that.": "Jon",
  "When you write a song, it may come from a personal space, but it very seldom actually represents you. It comes out of a sort of mood of melancholy, somehow. It's almost theatrical.": "James",
  "The calluses on your feet in space will eventually fall off. So, the bottoms of your feet become very soft like newborn baby feet. But the top of my feet develop rough alligator skin because I use the top of my feet to get around here on space station when using foot rails.": "Scott",
  "The majority of astronauts have to change their eyeglasses while in space. They bring eyeglasses with them and typically change a few months into the mission.": "Scott",
  "Flying in space is a privilege, whether it's the first time or the fourth time.": "Scott",
  "I think we all want to really live good lives, and we all really want to have a healthy planet, although I don't know if we're supposed to be on it forever. Now, does that mean that we should be building rocket ships to shoot us into outer space? Well if we can, I think we should.": "Anne",
  "Empty space is a boiling, bubbling brew of virtual particles that pop in and out of existence in a time scale so short that you can't even measure them.": "Lawrence",
  "Aside from communications satellites, space is devoid of industry.": "Lawrence",
  "Being a pop fan is a lot like Catholic devotion - lots of ritual, lots of ceremony... We touch the icon to enter the sacred space, genuflecting to reliquaries and ostentatoria that make something splendid of our most secret desires and agonies.": "Rob",
  "I've become convinced that Los Angeles is going to become the next contemporary art capital - no other city has more contemporary gallery space than Los Angeles. We've come into our own, finally.": "Eli",
  "Films can't change the society they can simply open the space for the discussion which can lead to social change and can start new forms of social activism. ": "Joshua",
  "I suppose there's a melancholy tone at the back of the American mind, a sense of something lost. And it's the lost world of Thomas Jefferson. It is the lost sense of innocence that we could live with a very minimal state, with a vast sense of space in which to work out freedom.": "George",
  "What was frustrating about Armageddon was the time I spent not doing anything. It was a big special effects film, and I wasn't crazy about pretending I was in outer space. It feels ridiculous.": "Steve",
  "I would love to play alongside Wayne Rooney. He does the running of two or three players and makes a lot of space. We would be the perfect combination.": "Zlatan",
  "I'd like to go to another planet, which I might live long enough to accomplish. Just get on a spaceship and go. But not the moon. I don't see any flowers there. The moon is too close. I want to go further.": "Shirley",
  "I feel like there's a lot of noise in the social space. The Vines and Instagrams of the world are gaining traction, and their solutions are perfect for their communities.": "Chad",
  "I've been lucky enough to fly to space twice.": "Chris",
  "There are no wishy-washy astronauts. You don't get up there by being uncaring and blase. And whatever gave you the sense of tenacity and purpose to get that far in life is absolutely reaffirmed and deepened by the experience itself.": "Chris",
  "As an astronaut, especially during launch, half of the risk of a six-month flight is in the first nine minutes.": "Chris",
  "It is our duty, as parents and as teachers, to give all children the space to build their emotional strength and provide a strong foundation for their future.": "Kate",
  "What you lose in blindness is the space around you, the place where you are, and without that you might not exist. You could be nowhere at all.": "Barbara",
  "I love cycling, but if I could find a way of building something above the streets for cyclists, that would be amazing. We need even more space.": "Michelle",
  "Everything's got space between it, the planets, trees, your eyes. Your eyes get too close together, it's a whole different world. You can lose perspective.": "Mos",
  "The space shuttle is a better and safer rocket than it was before the Challenger accident.": "Sally",
  "I slept just floating in the middle of the flight deck, the upper deck of the space shuttle.": "Sally",
  "I've discovered that half the people would love to go into space and there's no need to explain it to them. The other half can't understand and I couldn't explain it to them. If someone doesn't know why, I can't explain it.": "Sally",
  "As photographs give people an imaginary possession of a past that is unreal, they also help people to take possession of space in which they are insecure.": "Susan",
  "I've always wanted to do a space movie.": "Danny",
  "It is a matter of common knowledge among mystics that the evolutionary career of mankind is indissolubly bound up with the divine hierarchies, who rule the planets and the signs of the Zodiac, and that the passage of the Sun and the planets through the twelve signs of the Zodiac, marks man's progress in time and in space.": "Max",
  "Westerns are simple stories where there's good and there's evil and where people had a sense of space and freedom. Growing up in the city, as a kid, you've never really seen that before. It's a beautiful dream to go from concrete to big skies, dirt and horses.": "Antoine",
  "Once you digitize data, you can actually analyze patterns and relationships in geographic space - relationships between certain health patterns and air or water pollution, between plants and climate, soils, landscape.": "Jack",
  "A cigarette is a breathing space. It makes a parenthesis. The time of a cigarette is a parenthesis, and if it is shared, you are both in that parenthesis. It's like a proscenium arch for a dialogue.": "John",
  "The Indian business has largely grown on the back of exports. The domestic markets, as far as our Indian business is concerned, actually have contracted because of the contraction in the medium and heavy commercial vehicle space.": "Baba",
  "I'm in a space of surrendering and being open and seeing. It's a good place to be - the only place to be.": "Sherilyn",
  "So this is the space during tutoring hours. It's very busy. Same principles: one-on-one attention, complete devotion to the students' work and a boundless optimism and sort of a possibility of creativity and ideas.": "Dave",
  "I actually think that history has fed off the restlessness of cyber space, of kind of the frantic, segmented nature of the way we lead our lives. People want to be connected.": "Simon",
  "Very little useful science got done in the space station. NASA never did the experiments needed to develop the technologies required for a genuine interplanetary expedition: centrifugal gravity to avoid bodily harm and a truly closed biosphere.": "Gregory",
  "If I had unlimited funds, wall space and storage, I would collect a lot more things, like 'Planet of the Apes,' 'Star Wars,' science fiction stuff, autographs, and prop guns and weapons. I have to draw the line somewhere.": "Kirk",
  "I love horror movies in space. I love it when the genre switches over and what was sci-fi becomes horror.": "Kirk",
  "At the very least we should be given a bit of credit and a little bit of space, and maybe the media should think we could help them discover why English teams do not win European competitions.": "Jose",
  "When you're an adult, when times are good, entire years go by in what feels like the space of one season. But the worst trick time plays on you is just how slowly the worst times in your life take you to live through.": "Artie",
  "I don't think so much about verbal comedy. I always think about visual comedy. I was raised watching silents, and I'm always thinking about how to make cinema, not good talking - although I want good talking. I'm much more interested in framing, composition, and orchestration of bodies in space, and so forth.": "Alexander",
  "The novel space is a pure space. I'm nobody once I go into that room. I'm not gay, I'm not bald, I'm not Irish. I'm not anybody. I'm nobody. I'm the guy telling the story, and the only person that matters is the person reading that story, the target. It's to get that person to feel what I'm trying to dramatize.": "Colm",
  "People need to be made conscious of a very simple reality: we have no choice but to share this planet, this small blue sphere floating in the vast reaches of space, with all of our fellow 'passengers.'": "Daisaku",
  "To get noticed, I had to take my films in a space which was much more democratic in terms of cinema - the international film festivals.": "Anurag",
  "Speaking is what most people work on. They forget the thinking and the breathing and instead try to occupy space with sound.": "Margaret",
  "I realize that when I moved out of my father's house I shocked and frightened him because I needed a room of my own, a space of my own to reinvent myself.": "Sandra",
  "Not everyone is lucky enough to be given space and trust.": "Vanessa",
  "Time and space always change, but there is something which is eternal and changeless. For example, the world and time, past or future, nothing exists for us in sleep. But we exist. Let us try to find out that which is changeless and which always exists.": "Ramana",
  "An end of something means the beginning of something else, and I don't think that something else is going to be the death of the manned space program.": "John",
  "A Hubble Space Telescope photograph of the universe evokes far more awe for creation than light streaming through a stained glass window in a cathedral.": "Michael",
  "I've always wondered what it would be like if somebody from outer space landed with three heads. Then all of a sudden everybody else wouldn't look so bad, huh? Well, OK you're a little different from me but, hey, ya got one head.": "Cyndi",
  "I want people to be drawn into the space of the work. And a lot of people are like me in that they have relatively short attention spans. So I shoot for the window of opportunity.": "Barbara",
  "What happened in 2008 stopped people in their tracks. People stopped looking at their homes simply as commodities to exploit and starting thinking about how they might personalise that space and make them less bland and more autobiographical, and that's healthy, I think.": "Kevin",
  "Because of my job, my hair gets played with a lot on set, so I try to give it little bit of breathing space when I'm not working.": "Gugu",
  "I feel that my father's greatest legacy was the people he inspired to get involved in public service and their communities, to join the Peace Corps, to go into space. And really that generation transformed this country in civil rights, social justice, the economy and everything.": "Caroline",
  "I loved dinosaurs, I loved space, and I thought maybe I'd be the first paleo-astronaut.": "Bill",
  "When you gaze at stars and think about planets, the places it takes your imagination are amazing! You look up the sky, and you know the stars have always been here; they were referenced in biblical times and have always been present. They are somewhere up there in the future, and they guide you; they make you feel safe.": "Sarah",
  "In some ways, I missed my era because I'm big and messy and have big feelings and take up space on a stage rather than being diminutive and childlike in my woman-ness.": "Elizabeth",
  "We discount the physical, when, in fact, much of life is physical. People's personalities are partly formed by, or in response to, how they take up space; the physical mask has some relation, howsoever obscure, to the mental work happening underneath.": "Karan",
  "For many people, the family is portrayed as the settled place of reasonable safety, but as anyone who has read 'The God of Small Things' would know, for me it was a dangerous place. I felt humiliated in that space. I wanted to get away as soon as I could.": "Arundhati",
  "The advertising world had space men in it before spacemen existed.": "Fred",
  "There's nothing wrong with having a collection, but it becomes a problem when it overwhelms your space. When you're not displaying it properly, you're not enjoying it and it turns into clutter.": "Niecy",
  "NASA asked me to create meals for the space shuttle. Thai chicken was the favorite. I flew in a fake space shuttle, but I have no desire to go into space after seeing the toilet.": "Rachael",
  "Imagine a country that flies into space, launches Sputniks, creates such a defense system, and it can't resolve the problem of women's pantyhose. There's no toothpaste, no soap powder, not the basic necessities of life. It was incredible and humiliating to work in such a government.": "Mikhail",
  "Geez, all that money we waste on space exploration; just think how many bombs that would buy!": "Craig",
  "The space shuttle was designed, at least in part, to broaden our knowledge of the universe. To scientists, the vehicle was a tool; to engineers, it was their creation.": "Henry",
  "Conjoined twins simply may not need sex-romance partners as much as the rest of us do. Throughout time and space, they have described their condition as something like being attached to a soul mate.": "Alice",
  "Space is to place as eternity is to time.": "Joseph",
  "It seems to be that southern Europeans are just more intimate socially, whereas I like a lot of personal space - like, a mile from the nearest person is fine for me.": "Peter",
  "When you take a shower in space, you have to press the water onto your body to clean yourself, and then you gotta vacuum it off.": "Ace",
  "We want to make sure we get living astronauts to the surface of Mars.": "Ellen",
  "Mars missions will require up to three years in reduced gravity, so we need to make sure astronauts can not only survive but thrive as they move outward to explore this new world.": "Ellen",
  "As a card-carrying space nerd and NASA's chief scientist, I love space movies, from 'Star Trek' to 'Star Wars' to my all-time favorite - 'The Dish', an Australian comedy that celebrates that first moment when Neil Armstrong stepped down onto the surface of our moon.": "Ellen",
  "We are finding new areas in the ocean every day. It's as alien as going to outer space.": "Geoff",
  "Supplying fuel for a Mars expedition from the lunar surface is often suggested, but it's hard to make it pay off - Moon bases are expensive, and just buying more rockets to launch fuel from Earth is relatively cheap.": "Henry",
  "The Orion capsule uses an escape system quite like that of the Apollo spacecraft in the 1960s and 70s: an 'escape tower' containing a solid-fuel rocket that will pull it up and away from Ares I in a pinch.": "Henry",
  "Whether solid rockets are more or less likely to fail than liquid-fuel rockets is debatable. More serious, though, is that when they do fail, it's usually violent and spectacular.": "Henry",
  "Sometimes people wonder why aeroplanes are so cheap and rockets are so expensive. Even the most superficial comparison shows one obvious difference: aeroplane engines use outside air to burn their fuel, while rockets have to carry their own oxidisers along.": "Henry",
  "Reusable rockets promise much easier testing because you should usually get them back, and you can debug as you go rather than having to get everything perfect the first time.": "Henry",
  "I started realizing that music is the one area where I've always let go. When that saxophone goes into my mouth, I get into a space where I never think about the notes I've already played or anticipate the notes ahead.": "Kenny",
  "We felt it was very important for an entity like CCTV to make its presence felt... To generate a space and to define a space, that is the main thing.": "Rem",
  "You can write a little and can draw a little, but there's necessarily a limitation on both in a comic strip, since it appears in such a tiny space.": "Stephan",
  "My parents grew up during the space race, and I think they imagined the future would be us living on moon bases and everyone has rocket shoes.": "Brian",
  "As the earth spins through space, a view from above the North Pole would encompass most of the wealth of the world - most of its food, productive machines, doctors, engineers and teachers. A view from the opposite pole would encompass most of the world's poor.": "Barry",
  "I couldn't get my first film on the air. The first film I did was called 'The Race For Space,' about the U.S.-Soviet space race. The networks had a policy that I found out about the hard way. I even had a sponsor for my program, but the networks wouldn't put it on because it was independently produced.": "David",
  "When we're growing up there are all sorts of people telling us what to do when really what we need is space to work out who to be.": "Ellen",
  "Astronauts have been stuck in low-Earth orbit, boldly going nowhere. American attempts to kick-start a new phase of lunar exploration have stalled amid the realisation that NASA's budget is too small for the job.": "Paul",
  "Forget the technique. Hit the guy across from you. Don't let somebody come in your space.": "Karl",
  "The heart looks into space to be away from earth.": "Richard",
  "Inner space is so much more interesting, because outer space is so empty.": "Theodore",
  "I have learned to take the part of me that is very fearful and work on that. There is space for that in my life. I have learned to give myself a bit more freedom between 'action' and 'cut.' I come by all that fear honestly, like most humans have. I can't bring it with me to work, so in that way, the work feels quite liberating.": "Taylor",
  "Aviation - and space travel, in particular - have always been especially captivating.": "Felix",
  "It is strange, but nobody is shocked when pop singers make a fortune in the space of two years.": "Placido",
  "Lest those islands still seem to you too remote in space and time to be relevant to our modern societies, just think about the risks... of our increasing globalization and increasing worldwide economic interdependence.": "Jared",
  "Perhaps when distant people on other planets pick up some wavelength of ours all they hear is a continuous scream.": "Iris",
  "Cities have become places where we are controlled, by CCTV and other means, in the same way as machines are controlled. My works provide an imaginative space in which this can be challenged. It's like opening a window in a closed room.": "Antony",
  "I used to think that the great thing about sculpture was that, like Stonehenge, it was something that stood against time in an adamantine way, and was an absolute mass in space. Now I try to use the language of architecture to redescribe the body as a place.": "Antony",
  "Why is there space rather than no space? Why is space three-dimensional? Why is space big? We have a lot of room to move around in. How come it's not tiny? We have no consensus about these things. We're still exploring them.": "Leonard",
  "Space can vibrate, space can fluctuate, space can be quantum mechanical, but what the devil is it? And, you know, everybody has their own idea about what it is, but there's no coherent final consensus on why there is space.": "Leonard",
  "The most powerful argument of all for saving open space is economics; in most states, tourism is the number two industry.": "Jim",
  "Once you learn to choose your belongings properly, you will be left with only the amount that fits perfectly in the space you own.": "Marie",
  "For me, all the materials and objects I employ come from a specific space that's very personal.": "Rashid",
  "I think Windows 8 is a catastrophe for everyone in the PC space. I think we'll lose some of the top-tier PC/OEMs, who will exit the market. I think margins will be destroyed for a bunch of people.": "Gabe",
  "Am I willing to go to Mars? Yes, but I'm not willing to spend nine months getting there, then wait 18 more months until the planets align to come home.": "Eugene",
  "Questions and answers is a big space, and there are lots of possible systems that you can create for different goals.": "Adam",
  "We don't have parades for mathematicians, we have parades for astronauts. You don't think about all the thousands of people who worked on that capsule and crunched the numbers and were integral in getting that into space.": "Theodore",
  "The Lamb's Club is going to be a luxury bar and grill; we're not doing an overly fancy restaurant. We wanted to make a space that people will come to every day, almost like a very high-end bistro.": "Geoffrey",
  "In essence, String Theory describes space and time, matter and energy, gravity and light, indeed all of God's creation... as music.": "Roy",
  "Space travel is the only technology that is more dangerous and more expensive now than it was in its first year. Fifty years after Yuri Gagarin, the space shuttle ended up being more dangerous and more expensive to fly than those first throwaway rockets, even though large portions of it were reusable. It's absurd.": "Burt",
  "The photographs of space taken by our astronauts have been published all over the place. But the eye is a much more dynamic mechanism than any camera or pictures. It's a more exciting view in person than looking at the photographs. Of course, I personally am sick and tired of hearing people talk like that: I want to see it myself!": "Burt",
  "By 1973, we had a space station, the Skylab, and we had multiple probes going up to planets. So, all this wonderful stuff happened in 10 to 15 years. About that time, there should have been enormous initiatives to make it affordable for people to fly in space, not just a handful of trained NASA astronauts and Russian cosmonauts.": "Burt",
  "Back in the day, when I started, you were still allowed to make mistakes. You got to make your mistakes in public, in a way. I think the world was a more forgiving place when I started my career, in the sense that we got time and space to develop as a writer.": "Val",
  "So we want an Islamic state where Islamic law is not just in the books but enforced, and enforced with determination. There is no space and no room for democratic consultation. The Shariah is set and fixed, so why do we need to discuss it anymore? Just implement it!": "Abu",
  "The most amazing thing to me about the sea is the tide. A harbour like St. Ives is totally transformed in a very short space of time by the arrival or departure of the sea.": "John",
  "Having plants and flowers in my space makes me feel very calm and Zen. For me, it's important to meditate every morning to be very clear in the head, and nature really helps me do the same thing.": "Nicola",
  "Innumerable spirits and souls, when spread out through the same space, do not interfere with each other such that the diffusion of one would affect the diffusion of an infinity of others.": "Giordano",
  "While it's true that women are the minority in most tech companies, I don't think that inhibits entry into the tech space. My motto has always been, 'Live What You Love,' and as such, I think it's incredibly important to do work you believe in and to work for a company that has values that align with your own, be it in tech or another industry.": "Brit",
  "While we've taken seeds into space, and astronauts on the International Space Station have eaten lettuce they've grown, we haven't produced fruit in space, so we can't pollinate something.": "Helen",
  "During launch, the outside of the rocket is covered in a protective fairing, so we couldn't see outside, but as soon as that was jettisoned, my first view of the earth was over the Pacific Ocean, which was this wonderful deep blue, with clouds just over the top, and sunlight streaming in through the window.": "Helen",
  "People are fascinated by space flight. It makes them interested in science, gets them asking questions and motivates them.": "Helen",
  "You don't go into space just for the science. Economically, it is not worth it. I think the reason we should be in space is for the exploration; it's the human endeavour.": "Helen",
  "Those folks out in the space suits are going to be getting beat up.": "Duane",
  "The microgravity or the very, very low amount of gravity that we have up in space forces some changes in different processes. It forces changes in us as human beings.": "Laurel",
  "One of the things that we can say with confidence is that we will have much lighter, much stronger materials, and this will reduce the cost of air flight, and the cost of rockets.": "Ralph",
  "It's such a long mission and we get to spend so much time in space... we're doing such exciting research. And I don't want to overemphasize the life science research, but as a physician the life science research that we're doing is extremely exciting.": "Laurel",
  "We're looking at Earth science, observing our planet. Also space science, looking at the ozone in the atmosphere around our Earth. Also looking at life science. And on a human level, using ourselves as test subjects.": "Laurel",
  "Each one of us decides to incarnate upon this planet at a particular point in time and space. We have chosen to come here to learn a particular lesson that will advance us upon our spiritual, evolutionary pathway.": "Louise",
  "There is no time and space limitation for public accountability on the Internet. Creative commonality is standard and does not resemble the authoritarian style of the dead communist experience. It seems that it is no longer society's obligation to understand legislation it is a duty for governments to be understood by their people. ": "Eduardo",
  "Building one space station for everyone was and is insane: we should have built a dozen.": "Larry",
  "The dinosaurs became extinct because they didn't have a space program.": "Larry",
  "I used to think about how nice it would be to visit the planets. Of course, I didn't expect to see in my lifetime what has happened. I knew it would happen some day, but it came along faster than I at first thought.": "Clyde",
  "I said it's a cold universe and I don't mean that metaphorically. If you go out into space, it's cold. It's really cold and we don't know what's up there. We happen to be in this little pocket where there's a sun. What have we got except love and each other to guard against all that isolation and loneliness?": "David",
  "I don't have to go into outer space to write about an astronaut.": "Geoffrey",
  "I also administer the Internet Assigned Names Authority, which is the central coordinator for the Internet address space, domain names and Internet protocol conventions essential to the use and operation of the Internet.": "Jon",
  "NASA was going to pick a public school teacher to go into space, observe and make a journal about the space flight, and I am a teacher who always dreamed of going up into space.": "Christa",
  "I cannot join the space program and restart my life as an astronaut, but this opportunity to connect my abilities as an educator with my interests in history and space is a unique opportunity to fulfill my early fantasies.": "Christa",
  "The president felt that it was important to send an ordinary citizen to experience the excitement of space travel as a representative for all Americans.": "Christa",
  "My job in space will be to observe and write a journal. I am also going to be teaching a class for students on earth about life in space and on the space shuttle and conducting experiments.": "Christa",
  "I will go around the space shuttle and give a guided tour of the major areas and describe what is done in each area. This will be called The Ultimate Field Trip.": "Christa",
  "The lunar flights give you a correct perception of our existence. You look back at Earth from the moon, and you can put your thumb up to the window and hide the Earth behind your thumb. Everything you've ever known is behind your thumb, and that blue-and-white ball is orbiting a rather normal star, tucked away on the outer edge of a galaxy.": "Jim",
  "I am jewelry and objects together. This is the Elsa Peretti name to me. It is a very good balance for me to try and create with the person in mind or with the space in mind - to imagine a bowl of fruit or something for water. It is a little bit yin and yang.": "Elsa",
  "Space offers extraordinary potential for commerce and adventure, for new innovations and new tests of will. As Americans, we can't help but reach for the stars. It's our nature. It's our destiny.": "Bill",
  "I would have liked it to have stayed serious and have the adventures of a family lost in space. This isn't to take anything away from Jonathan and the Robot. I watch his performance today and he still makes me laugh.": "Mark",
  "Elon just presented a plan for settling the solar system in this century that is realistic and affordable. In my paper, 'A Pathway to a Thriving Commercial Space Economy' at IAC, I also laid out a path forward to a growing economy in space that produces new opportunities for all.": "Bruce",
  "Moving to San Francisco affected me in a pretty profound way, in a lot of respects. I think it helped me evolve my sound and think outside of the space I'd been in in Sacramento. The scene there is so insular and kind of feeds on itself: you just end up playing the same shows with the same people for the same people.": "Tycho",
  "Deployable structures have a key role to play in enabling new satellite constellations, particularly with regards to size and weight constraints, and Oxford Space Systems' suite of products will allow their customers to build much greater capability into much smaller satellites.": "Chad",
  "If you move something 10 pounds through space and then stop suddenly, there's a little overshoot. When you transfer weight from one leg to another, there's a certain way that it happens.": "Brad",
  "Sport-based video games occupy an odd space within the sphere of modern home entertainment. Reliably enjoyed by millions, the sport-based video game stands at what sometimes feels like an oblique angle from the larger medium, and in ways that can be hard to articulate.": "Tom",
  "It would take an extremely large spacecraft to deflect a large asteroid that would be headed directly for the Earth.": "Rusty",
  "We have the capability - physically, technically - to protect the Earth from asteroid impacts. We are now able to very slightly and subtly reshape the solar system in order to enhance human survival.": "Rusty",
  "How do you design it so that people can form a space of their own, and feel quiet and contemplative?": "Michael",
  "We must always emphasize research and development of science and mathematics, and I can think of no better way to achieve this than through our future in space.": "Nick",
  "Clearly, many branches of science need an exquisite precision of timekeeping and the infinitesimal decimals of calibration, so space launches, for example, are not scheduled for leap-second dates. But society as a whole neither needs that obsessive time measurement nor is well served by it.": "Jay",
  "I run a charity. If my name pops up in your call ID, chances are I'm about to ask you for something - money, free ad space, your first born. So it is probably no surprise that people often don't take my calls.": "Nancy",
  "Written and directed by French showman Georges Melies, 'Le Voyage' features one of the most indelible images in cinema history: the wounded Man in the Moon bleeding like a particularly runny Brie, grimacing in pain with a space capsule protruding from his right eye.": "Kage",
  "My type of basketball is about how to create space, how to maneuver, how to get your shot off.": "Hakeem",
  "It is difficult to imagine evolution in alien planets operating in any manner other than Darwinian.": "Simon",
  "I grew up watching a lot of the coverage of the early U.S. space program, all the way back starting with Mercury and then through Gemini and Apollo and of course going to the moon as the main part of the Apollo program.": "Linda",
  "I was a frustrated astronaut all my life. I grew up at a time when space seemed to have no boundaries, and lots of us presumed humans would be living on the moon and landing on Mars.": "David",
  "I watched the moon landing as a boy, and I thought that was the most exciting thing ever, going into space, orbiting Earth and exploring other planets. That looked fantastic.": "David",
  "A lot of these things will fly in later forms on the space station themselves, or a later form of that research will, once they kind of find out some of the basics from flying it on shuttle.": "Linda",
  "And then as we played more and more as a trio, it became more and more of a situation where we realized we really knew how to use the fourth member of the group - that space. The thing about the trio is that it's the biggest sound you can have with the smallest unit.": "Charlie",
  "I was born behind the Iron Curtain, and I remember heated discussions about large-scale terra-forming projects, such as reversing the direction of the river Ob or putting up large reflectors into space to heat up Siberia.": "Jaan",
  "It's important to bring things back from the Space Station because, unlike somebody living at the house where the garbage truck comes by twice a week, they don't have that in space.": "Mark",
  "I'm a fully trained cosmonaut and have completed 800 hours training, which has made me the No. 1 civilian reserve ready to visit the International Space Station. I am determined to go up, and I want to explore the Moon, Mars and beyond!": "Brian",
  "Technology is at a point where we should allow multiple parties to occupy the same spectral space.": "Ronald",
  "There are people who have too much space between their ears, and given the time, do nothing but free fall forever inside their head. It's a spooky thing to be left alone inside an angry inner-verse.": "James",
  "As the scene of life would be more the cold emptiness of space than the warm, dense atmosphere of planets, the advantage of containing no organic material at all, so as to be independent of both these conditions, would be increasingly felt.": "John",
  "I certainly remember building model rockets. It was fun to watch the rocket blast into the air, suspenseful to wonder if the parachute would open to bring the rocket safely back.": "Eric",
  "Most of our history in space has been communicated in terms of action - what people do, a chronological list of events which have transpired - as opposed to the human experience of having done those things.": "Story",
  "I would have taken whatever hand I was dealt. Space was it.": "Story",
  "I left Aerospace because I wanted to go build, and put spacecraft together.": "Gwynne",
  "Yet, upon the whole, the space I traversed is unlikely to become the haunt of civilized man, or will only become so in isolated spots, as a chain of connection to a more fertile country; if such a country exist to the westward.": "Charles",
  "I believe that public space should be intentional: it should be obvious that you belong.": "Janet",
  "When your voice contradicts reality and truth, the only way to create space for it is to discredit reality and truth.": "John",
  "Space station is, it really is one of the more, if not the most, impressive technological achievement of the modern day, not only in what we've accomplished engineering-wise but what we've accomplished on this international scale, because anybody will tell you that half the challenge is making it all work.": "Kevin",
  "I think it's going to be a very important, unique data set in terms of measuring the behavior of your lower body in space and trying to figure out what we can do to preserve bone and muscle density.": "John",
  "I'm Chinese-American, of course, and so it's very interesting to see China actually launch their own astronauts, becoming the third nation, following the United States and Russia, to do so.": "Leroy",
  "I wrote my first book in fifth grade. It was about a dog that goes to outer space and is an ambassador for Earth.": "Josh",
  "The best bands kept making records and had this evolution, where by the end, by their commercial phase or sellout phase, the records are from outer space.": "Ariel",
  "When I'm auditioning for something, if it's not me, I really hope the part doesn't go to me. You know what I mean? I don't want to be at the wrong place at the wrong time. If it's me, wonderful. If it's not me, there's space for all of us.": "Rachel",
  "When I die there may be a paragraph or two in the newspapers. My name will linger in the British Museum Reading Room catalogue for a space at the head of a long list of books for which no one will ever ask.": "C.",
  "In 1966, NASA took over in space, and it has been a bureaucratic mess ever since.": "Chuck",
  "Hard systems are everything we're using right now - computers, phones, planes, the clothes you're wearing, the room you're in. Everything there involves 100% use of technology and expertise to make it, and nothing we make - including space exploration vehicles and so on - is complex. Everything we make is complicated. Nothing is self-renewing.": "Allan",
  "The question we ask is - if there is life on other planets, should we expect it to be based on the same molecules, i.e. be universal - or should we expect it to depend on the local conditions, i.e. on the planet's geochemistry. So to find out, we try experiments on biomolecules, starting with such geochemistry conditions.": "Dimitar",
  "To me, there is something superbly symbolic in the fact that an astronaut, sent up as assistant to a series of computers, found that he worked more accurately and more intelligently than they. Inside the capsule, man is still in charge.": "Adlai",
  "If you gave kids peas that didn't look like peas and said they were a space shuttle, they're much more apt to eat them because it's now playtime.": "Hod",
  "My two primary areas of focus have been open-space conservation and education, and I expect those to remain my priorities in the future. The Irvine open space and parklands provide serenity and balance to our unique Orange County lifestyle.": "Donald",
  "You could probably go three or four months without the word 'God' coming from my dad's mouth Mum would pray for a parking space. ": "Laurence",
  "When I first joined the Irvine Company, I realized that less than 11,000 acres were designated as open space in the original master plan, and that just didn't seem adequate to me. So, I began the lengthy process working with public and community organizations to add more open space.": "Donald",
  "The beauty of the Internet is that there's no space limit.": "David",
  "I think space exploration is very important. I think there is very intelligent life on Mars. I believe that Martians are spying on us from the bottom of the ocean.": "Annabella",
  "Rocket scientists agree that we have about reached the limit of our ability to travel in space using chemical rockets. To achieve anything near the speed of light we will need a new energy source and a new propellant. Nuclear fission is not an option.": "Wilson",
  "A favorite film of mine is 'Office Space' and I love 'The Hangover.' That is a really good comedy from character in that film, and that is true of 'Office Space' too.": "Seth",
  "I felt so free in space, flying around and unrestrained by any social relationships, but my life since has changed a lot. Now I am extra-careful about what I say and do because everyone recognises me.": "Yi",
  "Eventually there are going to be cities in space.": "Alan",
  "We knew it was going to be difficult to get to the moon. We didn't know how difficult.": "Alan",
  "Growing up in the '60s and early '70s, with the space flight and the Apollo program, I always loved planes. I always loved rockets and I always loved space travel.": "Stewart",
  "The real message of the Dance opens up the vistas of life to all who have the urge to express beauty with no other instrument than their own bodies, with no apparatus and no dependence on anything other than space.": "Ruth",
  "The body moves through space every day, and in architecture in cities that can be orchestrated. Not in a dictatorial fashion, but in a way of creating options, open-ended sort of personal itineraries within a building. And I see that as akin to cinematography or choreography, where episodic movement, episodic moments, occur in dance and film.": "Antoine",
  "I was painfully shy, so my aunt suggested to my mum that me and my brother go to Stage 84, a performing arts school in Yorkshire. I've probably romanticised it in my head, but I seem to remember that in the space of an hour's drama workshop, I was transformed. I went in really shy, and I came out full of confidence.": "Christian",
  "While American football is very structured and linear and static - where everyone lines up, and there's a burst, and it happens - soccer is like the cosmos. It's like constellations. It's bodies moving in space. It's a very spherical game.": "Gabriel",
  "You never enjoy the world aright, till the sea itself floweth in your veins, till you are clothed with the heavens and crowned with the stars.": "Thomas",
  "Earlier generations of stars in the galaxy could well have had planets. But really, there was only hydrogen and helium to work with, so they'd all be gas giants and not small, rocky planets.": "Jill",
  "I think most astronauts are not risk takers. We take calculated risks for something that we think is worthwhile.": "Michael",
  "For me, the Earth had always been a kind of a safe haven, you know, where I could go to work or be in my home or take my kids to school. But I realized it really wasn't that. It really is its own spaceship. And I had always been a space traveler.": "Michael",
  "Man must be in space - that is what we are destined for. There is nothing else that we can do.": "Majel",
  "Being outside during the space walk, the view of the Earth is just spectacular, and getting a chance to do that is just unbelievable, everything about it. You are going around the Earth at 17,500 miles an hour, so you have 45 minutes of sunlight followed by 45 minutes of darkness. You do a lap every 90 minutes.": "Michael",
  "When people are reading a book, it's a personal thing. They're reading it; it's in their own mind; it's in their own personal space when they're reading it.": "Kristy",
  "As a child, I spent a lot of time wandering around the prairies and in the hills, and there was a sense that it was such a wide-open space, and there was kind of a feeling of potential. I could imagine anything happening there.": "Arthur",
  "It's everywhere, really. It's between the galaxies. It is in this room. We believe that everywhere that you have space, empty space, that you cannot avoid having some of this dark energy.": "Adam",
  "You will be hard pressed to read another book that understands you as well as 'Leaves of Grass' does. It was made for you in the way that the constellations were made for you. It understands and makes space for your doubts, your love, the guilt and passions of your life and waits for you.": "Rowan",
  "The discovery and investigation of life on other planets is likely to change many of our ideas about how life arose on the Earth and even what is life and its natural development.": "George",
  "Dot Hacker, to me, sounds like a collection of all my tastes. I hear four people trying to fill up as much space as they can.": "Josh",
  "The sun and its retinue of planets drift as a group through the vast gulfs of space that separate the stars.": "Barney",
  "Usually I design the lighting and when I have the physical set there, I'm not good at going out loosely and saying, 'Do you what you want, give it to the editor, and he'll figure it out.' I physically then walk on with the actors and I say, 'Let's walk until you guys feel the space works for you, and tell me when all that happens.'": "Tarsem",
  "I love punching the ceiling with my fists when I'm lost or I can't find a parking space.": "Laura",
  "It was only when I started to dig my heels in that I started to realize that's what I needed to do - that nobody was going to open the door for me, that I had to make some space.": "Dave",
  "Your belief system saturates the space around you.": "Aaron",
  "The ostensible subject of my photographs may be motion, but the subtext is time. A dancer's movements illustrate the passage of time, giving it a substance, materiality, and space. In my photographs, time is stopped, a split second becomes an eternity, and an ephemeral moment is solid as sculpture.": "Lois",
  "Micro satellites, about the size of a loaf of bread, are going to be going into space more and more.": "Jim",
  "I do not remember how it got into my head to make the first calculations related to rocket. It seems to me the first seeds were planted by famous fantaseour, J. Verne.": "Konstantin",
  "Mankind will not forever remain on Earth but, in the pursuit of light and space, will first timidly emerge from the bounds of the atmosphere and then advance until he has conquered the whole of circumsolar space.": "Konstantin",
  "Thank you for the confidence put in my by the motherland and the people, for giving me this chance to represent China's millions of women by going into space.": "Liu",
  "We have never observed infinity in nature. Whenever you have infinities in a theory, that's where the theory fails as a description of nature. And if space was born in the Big Bang, yet is infinite now, we are forced to believe that it's instantaneously, infinitely big. It seems absurd.": "Janna",
  "From day one, I have been told I am no different from the male astronauts. As a pilot, I flew in the sky. Now that I am an astronaut, I will fly in space.": "Liu",
  "Performing tai chi in space - it is comfortable we got more outer space chi. ": "Liu",
  "I like the sci-fi channel. Just science in general. I came across a segment on time travel and how time travel is possible. We create a spaceship that's moving at almost the speed of light, we go in that spaceship in outer space, and we fly around for a year, when we get back to Earth, Earth would've aged 10 years.": "Von",
  "The privilege I've had as a curator is not just the discovery of new works... but what I've discovered about myself and what I can offer in the space of an exhibition - to talk about beauty, to talk about power, to talk about ourselves, and to talk and speak to each other.": "Thelma",
  "I'm no romantic, surfing, California boy. I like reading, writing, philosophizing. Scheming. I've been doing some exploration of the inner space.": "Henry",
  "If I hadn't been inside of Biosphere 2 and really lived a biological life-support system, I definitely would not be involved in life-support systems for space.": "Jane",
  "For a long time, we've worked on detecting planets with whatever was at hand, making use of existing small telescopes or even amateur telescopes. It's time to move on to the next stage.": "Andrew",
  "The soul, who is lifted by a very great and yearning desire for the honor of God and the salvation of souls, begins by exercising herself, for a certain space of time, in the ordinary virtues, remaining in the cell of self-knowledge, in order to know better the goodness of God towards her.": "Catherine",
  "Life can be less mysterious than we make it out to be when we try to think about how it would be on other planets. And if we remove the mystery of life, then I think it is a little bit easier for us to think about how we live, and how perhaps we're not as special as we always think we are.": "Chris",
  "We were young, we were pilots, and we were hungry to test the new technology of 'space machines.' And we all wanted to be first.": "Gherman",
  "Competitive golf is played mainly on a five-and-a-half-inch course... the space between your ears.": "Bobby",
  "I like to talk. That's why I can't karaoke in a private room. Those types of shenanigans are only good in a public space. I got to say, though, with smartphones and instant upload of everything, our generation and definitely the next generation coming up, it's going to be hard to act a fool.": "Liza",
  "Discount air fares, a car in every parking space and the interstate highway system have made every place accessible - and every place alike.": "Ronald",
  "The blackness of space was a big shock to me. It is a deep, three-dimensional, oily blackness. You can feel the distance.": "Thomas",
  "When we're on the space station, we orbit the Earth 16 times per day, which means we're constantly moving to and away from the sun. From light to shadow, the temperature swings by 300 degrees. Of course we're protected by the gear we wear, but you can definitely feel this temperature change.": "Thomas",
  "Writing is always a restorative process. It's like paddling a kayak. When you're writing, you can't do anything else. You're in the space you're in. So, in that way, it's enormously centering and restorative.": "Tabitha",
  "I've always been interested in the idea of space exploration. When I was younger it was just a dream, but the theory of rockets being able to travel through space was very much alive. I found it very exciting.": "Gerry",
  "I have some NASA memorabilia from the early Apollo days that I can't imagine parting with. I've always wanted to play sort of like a space cowboy, too, like the idea of Captain Kirk. I think that's everybody's dream though, right?": "Matthew",
  "I just don't think there are any rules to color. You have a small space with no windows? Put lamps in there, make it dramatic, paint the ceiling black. Do something with it. If it's dark, accentuate the darkness.": "David",
  "Once solved, the severe handicaps imposed on space exploration by the weight and chemical limitations of rockets would no longer apply. The whole timetable of our conquest of the planets in our solar system would be tremendously speeded up, from hot Mercury all the way out to frigid Pluto.": "Donald",
  "I see Earth! It is so beautiful!": "Yuri",
  "The world itself looks cleaner and so much more beautiful. Maybe we can make it that way - the way God intended it to be - by giving everyone, eventually, that new perspective from out in space.": "Roger",
  "The Earth reminded us of a Christmas tree ornament hanging in the blackness of space. As we got farther and farther away it diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful marble you can imagine.": "James",
  "A small house must depend on its grouping with other houses for its beauty, and for the preservation of light air and the maximum of surrounding open space.": "Clarence",
  "Any person, brought into the presence of this fact, stops for a few moments and remains pensive and silent; and then generally leaves, carrying with him forever a sharper, keener sense of our incessant motion through space.": "Leon",
  "Space, time, matter, energy and biological life may be the result of a Source Field that is conscious and alive in its own unique way - on a scale far too vast for the finite mind to fathom.": "David",
  "Yes, people do come across the street to say hi, but as they approach and get near, my perception of space begins to dissolve, and a new interest takes over that is primarily emotional, and with it comes a desire to touch, which may be a human interest, but not the interest of my work.": "Diego",
  "Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.": "Edsger",
  "Man is still the most extraordinary computer of all.": "John",
  "I am thankful the most important key in history was invented. It's not the key to your house, your car, your boat, your safety deposit box, your bike lock or your private community. It's the key to order, sanity, and peace of mind. The key is 'Delete.'": "Elayne",
  "Computers themselves, and software yet to be developed, will revolutionize the way we learn.": "Steve",
  "Globalization, as defined by rich people like us, is a very nice thing... you are talking about the Internet, you are talking about cell phones, you are talking about computers. This doesn't affect two-thirds of the people of the world.": "Jimmy",
  "What is Apple, after all? Apple is about people who think 'outside the box,' people who want to use computers to help them change the world, to help them create things that make a difference, and not just to get a job done.": "Steve",
  "Computers are like Old Testament gods lots of rules and no mercy. ": "Joseph",
  "A computer once beat me at chess, but it was no match for me at kick boxing.": "Emo",
  "When people think about computer science, they imagine people with pocket protectors and thick glasses who code all night.": "Marissa",
  "The new information technology... Internet and e-mail... have practically eliminated the physical costs of communications.": "Peter",
  "I do not fear computers. I fear the lack of them.": "Isaac",
  "Never trust a computer you can't throw out a window.": "Steve",
  "The Internet is not just one thing, it's a collection of things - of numerous communications networks that all speak the same digital language.": "Jim",
  "Software comes from heaven when you have good hardware.": "Ken",
  "Computers don't create computer animation any more than a pencil creates pencil animation. What creates computer animation is the artist.": "John",
  "To err is human, but to really foul things up you need a computer.": "Paul",
  "Anyway, all these computers and digital gadgets are no good. They just fill your head with numbers and that can't be good for you.": "Prince",
  "In Hollywood, they think drawn animation doesn't work anymore, computers are the way. They forget that the reason computers are the way is that Pixar makes good movies. So everybody tries to copy Pixar. They're relying too much on the technology and not enough on the artists.": "Tim",
  "In fact, technology has been the story of human progress from as long back as we know. In 100 years people will look back on now and say, 'That was the Internet Age.' And computers will be seen as a mere ingredient to the Internet Age.": "Reed",
  "The spread of computers and the Internet will put jobs in two categories. People who tell computers what to do, and people who are told by computers what to do.": "Marc",
  "It's hardware that makes a machine fast. It's software that makes a fast machine slow.": "Craig",
  "Part of the inhumanity of the computer is that, once it is competently programmed and working smoothly, it is completely honest.": "Isaac",
  "Treat your password like your toothbrush. Don't let anybody else use it, and get a new one every six months.": "Clifford",
  "The most compelling reason for most people to buy a computer for the home will be to link it to a nationwide communications network. We're just in the beginning stages of what will be a truly remarkable breakthrough for most people - as remarkable as the telephone.": "Steve",
  "We think of computers as smart and powerful machines. But your goldfish is smarter.": "Jason",
  "We can be incredibly disconnected in this day and age with computers and cell phones.": "Marcia",
  "Home computers are being called upon to perform many new functions, including the consumption of homework formerly eaten by the dog.": "Doug",
  "There is a computer disease that anybody who works with computers knows about. It's a very serious disease and it interferes completely with the work. The trouble with computers is that you 'play' with them!": "Richard",
  "From computers to information technology to airplanes, it has been America's unique blend of republican government and free-market capitalism that has allowed us to surpass all other nations in history.": "George",
  "Google did a great job hacking the Web to create search - and then monetizing search with advertising. And Apple did a great job humanizing hardware and software so that formerly daunting computers and applications could become consumer-friendly devices - even a lifestyle brand.": "Douglas",
  "Machine learning is the science of getting computers to learn without being explicitly programmed.": "Sebastian",
  "I think that what computers have done is just disastrous to the language.": "Gary",
  "Design is the fundamental soul of a man-made creation that ends up expressing itself in successive outer layers of the product or service. The iMac is not just the color or translucence or the shape of the shell. The essence of the iMac is to be the finest possible consumer computer in which each element plays together.": "Steve",
  "By the time we get to the 2040s, we'll be able to multiply human intelligence a billionfold. That will be a profound change that's singular in nature. Computers are going to keep getting smaller and smaller. Ultimately, they will go inside our bodies and brains and make us healthier, make us smarter.": "Ray",
  "Man-made computers are limited in their performance by finite processing speed and memory. So, too, the cosmic computer is limited in power by its age and the finite speed of light.": "Paul",
  "Technology has forever changed the world we live in. We're online, in one way or another, all day long. Our phones and computers have become reflections of our personalities, our interests, and our identities. They hold much that is important to us.": "James",
  "I think computer viruses should count as life. I think it says something about human nature that the only form of life we have created so far is purely destructive. We've created life in our own image.": "Stephen",
  "What I was proud of was that I used very few parts to build a computer that could actually speak words on a screen and type words on a keyboard and run a programming language that could play games. And I did all this myself.": "Steve",
  "Computing is not about computers any more. It is about living.": "Nicholas",
  "I am regularly asked what the average Internet user can do to ensure his security. My first answer is usually 'Nothing you're screwed'. ": "Bruce",
  "Theaters are always going to be around, and doing fine. With computers and technology, we're becoming more and more secluded from each other. And the movie theater is one of the last places where we can still gather and experience something together. I don't think the desire for that magic will ever go away.": "Wolfgang",
  "Computers are still technology because we are still wrestling with it: it's still being invented we're still trying to work out how it works. There's a world of game interaction to come that you or I wouldn't recognise. It's time for the machines to disappear. The computer's got to disappear into all of the things we use. ": "Douglas",
  "People are craving this great progress in electronics, going after computers, the Internet, etc. It's a giant progress technologically. But they must have a balance of soul, a balance for human beauty. That means art has an important role.": "Mstislav",
  "By 2029, computers will have emotional intelligence and be convincing as people.": "Ray",
  "As computer intelligence gets better, what will be possible when we interface our brains with computers? It might sound scary, but early evidence suggests otherwise: interfacing brains with machines can be helpful in treating traumatic brain injury, repairing spinal cord damage, and countless other applications.": "Bill",
  "Men and machines are good at different things. People form plans and make decisions in complicated situations. We are less good at making sense of enormous amounts of data. Computers are exactly the opposite: they excel at efficient data processing but struggle to make basic judgments that would be simple for any human.": "Peter",
  "The computer is a moron.": "Peter",
  "The question of whether a computer can think is no more interesting than the question of whether a submarine can swim.": "Edsger",
  "Security is, I would say, our top priority because for all the exciting things you will be able to do with computers - organizing your lives, staying in touch with people, being creative - if we don't solve these security problems, then people will hold back.": "Bill",
  "If net neutrality goes away, it will fundamentally change everything about the Internet.": "James",
  "I look like a geeky hacker, but I don't know anything about computers.": "Justin",
  "My goal wasn't to make a ton of money. It was to build good computers.": "Steve",
  "Go into the auto mechanic, you've got to know computers to be able to work on the cars.": "Ann",
  "Until computers and robots make quantum advances, they basically remain adding machines: capable only of doing things in which all the variables are controlled and predictable.": "Michio",
  "The diverse threats we face are increasingly cyber-based. Much of America's most sensitive data is stored on computers. We are losing data, money, and ideas through cyber intrusions. This threatens innovation and, as citizens, we are also increasingly vulnerable to losing our personal information.": "James",
  "No one ever said on their deathbed, 'Gee, I wish I had spent more time alone with my computer'.": "Danielle",
  "Computers make it easier to do a lot of things, but most of the things they make it easier to do don't need to be done.": "Andy",
  "The Internet: transforming society and shaping the future through chat.": "Dave",
  "I was afraid of the internet... because I couldn't type.": "Jack",
  "The internet could be a very positive step towards education, organisation and participation in a meaningful society.": "Noam",
  "One of the most feared expressions in modern times is 'The computer is down.'": "Norman",
  "Personally, I rather look forward to a computer program winning the world chess championship. Humanity needs a lesson in humility.": "Richard",
  "The good news about computers is that they do what you tell them to do. The bad news is that they do what you tell them to do.": "Ted",
  "People think computers will keep them from making mistakes. They're wrong. With computers you make mistakes faster.": "Adam",
  "Supercomputers will achieve one human brain capacity by 2010, and personal computers will do so by about 2020.": "Ray",
  "We're entering a new world in which data may be more important than software.": "Tim",
  "In short, software is eating the world.": "Marc",
  "We can do things that we never could before. Stop-motion lets you build tiny little worlds, and computers make that world even more believable.": "Nick",
  "If you could utilize the resources of the end users' computers, you could do things much more efficiently.": "Niklas",
  "Don't try to be like Jackie. There is only one Jackie. Study computers instead.": "Jackie",
  "This is what customers pay us for - to sweat all these details so it's easy and pleasant for them to use our computers. We're supposed to be really good at this. That doesn't mean we don't listen to customers, but it's hard for them to tell you what they want when they've never seen anything remotely like it.": "Steve",
  "By 2020, most home computers will have the computing power of a human brain. That doesn't mean that they are brains, but it means that in terms of raw processing, they can process bits as fast as a brain can. So the question is, how far behind that is the development of a machine that's as smart as we are?": "Seth",
  "A smartphone links patients' bodies and doctors' computers, which in turn are connected to the Internet, which in turn is connected to any smartphone anywhere. The new devices could put the management of an individual's internal organs in the hands of every hacker, online scammer, and digital vandal on Earth.": "Charles",
  "The idea behind digital computers may be explained by saying that these machines are intended to carry out any operations which could be done by a human computer.": "Alan",
  "Interactive computers and software will, I think, provide a less costly method of doing some kinds of inquiry, in knowledge acquisition and even reasoning and interaction.": "Roy",
  "For short term relaxation, I take a hot tub. It's my best way to unblock writers' block, too. For a bit longer relaxation, I enjoy camping. Just being in the wilderness, with no phones or computers or anything I have to do really refreshes my spirit.": "Ellen",
  "I think after a time there won't be anything left to be interesting for mankind. Computers are about to do everything for us. Cellphones are smarter than we are. We'll embrace spirituality because we'll be bored of everything else.": "Damian",
  "My goal wasn't to make a ton of money. It was to build good computers. I only started the company when I realized I could be an engineer forever.": "Steve",
  "Because you have things like 'American Idol' and you've got radio stations that play music made entirely by computers, it's easy to forget there are bands with actual people playing actual instruments that rock.": "Dave",
  "I think a lot of people will be liberated from a lot of oppressive manufacturing jobs, or a lot of service jobs, because they'll be done by computers. There'll be the world's best education available online and free.": "Tyler",
  "Computers have proved to be formidable chess players. In fact, they've beaten our top human chess champions.": "Neil",
  "Juries are not computers. They are composed of human beings who evaluate evidence differently.": "Alan",
  "Everything is being run by computers. Everything is reliant on these computers working. We have become very reliant on Internet, on basic things like electricity, obviously, on computers working. And this really is something which creates completely new problems for us. We must have some way of continuing to work even if computers fail.": "Mikko",
  "Computers and computing are all around us. Some computing is highly visible, like your laptop. But this is only part of a computing iceberg. A lot more lies hidden below the surface. We don't see and usually don't think about the computers inside appliances, cars, airplanes, cameras, smartphones, GPS navigators and games.": "Brian",
  "I've always been into computers. When I was getting out of high school and forming my identity musically, all of it was really coming into the fold, computers and drum machines. It felt like, you know, I'm in the right place at the right time. I liked the collision.": "Trent",
  "With all the abundance we have of computers and computing, what is scarce is human attention and time.": "Satya",
  "I've always been at the intersection of computers and whatever they can revolutionize.": "Jeff",
  "Social media can be dangerous. People hide behind their computers and write negative things, so I like to keep it about communicating with my fans.": "Mo",
  "Today, computers are almost second nature to most of us.": "James",
  "Managerial and professional people hadn't really used computers, hadn't sat down at keyboards, until personal computers. Personal computers have a totally different feel.": "Mitch",
  "In the future, I'm sure there will be a lot more robots in every aspect of life. If you told people in 1985 that in 25 years they would have computers in their kitchen, it would have made no sense to them.": "Rodney",
  "It always helps to be a good programmer. It is important to like computers and to be able to think of things people would want to do with their computers.": "Bill",
  "Kids are finding out about the potential for discovery online from other sources; many of them have computers at home, for instance, or their friends have them.": "Daniel",
  "Science fiction has done a really good job of scaring us into thinking that computers shouldn't get too smart, because as soon as they get really smart, they're going to take over the world and kill us, or something like that. But why would they do that?": "Luis",
  "I start every book with something that outrages me. I'm outraged by the FBI, the CIA, and computers that seem to have catalogued our lives. Power too often is accompanied by irresponsibility.": "Robert",
  "In 1983, before computers came along, it wasn't easy to do electronic basslines and rhythms.": "Gillian",
  "Eventually, I believe, current attempts to understand the mind by analogy with man-made computers that can perform superbly some of the same external tasks as conscious beings will be recognized as a gigantic waste of time.": "Thomas",
  "Once computers can program, they basically take over technological progress because already, today, the majority of technological progress is run by software, by programming.": "Jaan",
  "No computer or smartphone can ever be considered 100 percent 'safe.' We're all engaged in a perpetual battle with criminals and hostile governments trying to use computers and the Internet to steal information and identities.": "Walt",
  "We could say we want the Web to reflect a vision of the world where everything is done democratically. To do that, we get computers to talk with each other in such a way as to promote that ideal.": "Tim",
  "The only legitimate use of a computer is to play games.": "Eugene",
  "The most used program in computers and education is PowerPoint. What are you learning about the nature of the medium by knowing how do to a great PowerPoint presentation? Nothing. It certainly doesn't teach you how to think critically about living in a culture of simulation.": "Sherry",
  "Few companies that installed computers to reduce the employment of clerks have realized their expectations... They now need more, and more expensive clerks even though they call them 'operators' or 'programmers.'": "Peter",
  "Many of our own people here in this country do not ask about computers, telephones and television sets. They ask - when will we get a road to our village.": "Thabo",
  "We're going to be able to ask our computers to monitor things for us, and when certain conditions happen, are triggered, the computers will take certain actions and inform us after the fact.": "Steve",
  "Computers make me totally blank out.": "Dalai",
  "It's been my policy to view the Internet not as an 'information highway', but as an electronic asylum filled with babbling loonies.": "Mike",
  "The next major explosion is going to be when genetics and computers come together. I'm talking about an organic computer - about biological substances that can function like a semiconductor.": "Alvin",
  "I never have used computers or calculators. I've always been able to figure out in my head, far before my opposition has, in negotiating for acquisitions, where we need to be and where the numbers are and how we could get the best sight of the bargain, without having to resort to accountants or assistants or financial experts.": "Jon",
  "We're leading a fundamental shift from centralized energy to distributed energy. Energy will go in that direction, just like mainframe computers went to client servers, then to the Internet. I believe in solar, and the macro trends are just too undeniable.": "Lynn",
  "Before computers, telephone lines and television connect us, we all share the same air, the same oceans, the same mountains and rivers. We are all equally responsible for protecting them.": "Julia",
  "People are seduced by signals from the world, but that is manipulation, not reality. Computers have learned more about us than we've learned about them.": "Douglas",
  "Computers double their performance every month.": "Stephen",
  "Electromagnetic theory and experiment gave us the telephone, radio, TV, computers, and made the internal combustion engine practical - thus, the car and airplane, leading inevitably to the rocket and outer-space exploration.": "Gregory",
  "I regard the brain as a computer which will stop working when its components fail. There is no heaven or afterlife for broken down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. ": "Stephen",
  "Computers are to design as microwaves are to cooking.": "Milton",
  "Even when I work with computers, with high technology, I always try to put in the touch of the hand.": "Issey",
  "There is a real danger that computers will develop intelligence and take over. We urgently need to develop direct connections to the brain so that computers can add to human intelligence rather than be in opposition.": "Stephen",
  "When Steve Jobs toured Xerox PARC and saw computers running the first operating system that used Windows and a mouse, he assumed he was looking at a new way to work a personal computer. He brought the concept back to Cupertino and created the Mac, then Bill Gates followed suit, and the rest is history.": "Douglas",
  "The Semantic Web is not a separate Web but an extension of the current one, in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.": "Tim",
  "Computers let people avoid people, going out to explore. It's so different to just open a website instead of looking at a Picasso in a museum in Paris.": "Raf",
  "When you learn to read and write, it opens up opportunities for you to learn so many other things. When you learn to read, you can then read to learn. And it's the same thing with coding. If you learn to code, you can code to learn. Now some of the things you can learn are sort of obvious. You learn more about how computers work.": "Mitchel",
  "Computers and electronic music are not the opposite of the warm human music. It's exactly the same.": "Bill",
  "We went from a world where almost nobody knew anything about computers to a world where almost all of us are computer geeks for a huge fraction of our day. And I'd like to see that happen with the digital world of biological molecules, too.": "George",
  "There's so much free material on the Internet you can learn from, and some people are pure self-starters: they pick up computers and teach themselves everything. Certainly there are millions of people like that. But at the same time, I think it's a pretty small percentage of the population.": "Tyler",
  "I think I thought it would be important for electronics as we knew it then, but that was a much simpler business and electronics was mostly radio and television and the first computers.": "Jack",
  "To err is human - and to blame it on a computer is even more so.": "Robert",
  "Computers, like automobiles and airplanes, do only what people tell them to do.": "Bill",
  "Our computers have become windows through which we can gaze upon a world that is virtually without horizons or boundaries.": "Joseph",
  "Computers may save time but they sure waste a lot of paper. About 98 percent of everything printed out by a computer is garbage that no one ever reads.": "Andy",
  "In computing, turning the obvious into the useful is a living definition of the word 'frustration'.": "Alan",
  "There is no reason for any individual to have a computer in his home.": "Ken",
  "The power of the computer is starting to spread.": "Bill",
  "If you like overheads, you'll love PowerPoint.": "Edward",
  "Nanotechnology will let us build computers that are incredibly powerful. We'll have more power in the volume of a sugar cube than exists in the entire world today.": "Ralph",
  "One of the biggest challenges we had in the first decade was not that many people had personal computers. There weren't that many people to sell to, and it was hard to identify them.": "Steve",
  "My whole life had been designing computers I could never build.": "Steve",
  "Musicians and journalists are the canaries in the coalmine, but, eventually, as computers get more and more powerful, it will kill off all middle-class professions.": "Jaron",
  "We've lost touch and allowed technology to take precedence over organic nature. But let's not forget that those microchips in our computers came from elements of the earth.": "Emilio",
  "I take computers practically apart and put them back together. I have a supercomputer I built over the years out of different computers.": "Jared",
  "Computers and the Internet have made it really easy to rant. It's made everyone overly opinionated.": "Scott",
  "Equipped with cell phones, beepers, and handheld computers, the 'conspicuously industrious' blur the line between home and office by working anytime, anywhere.": "Jo",
  "We all grew up, our grandmothers and mothers had about three channels to watch, so we watched those soaps and now, a generation has grown up with the Internet and computers and video games.": "Jack",
  "I get hired to hack into computers now and sometimes it's actually easier than it was years ago.": "Kevin",
  "I use many different gadgets connected with computers; I use PCs, laptops and a Palm Pilot. I also use the Internet to visit websites, especially within Polish-language Internet. I usually go to political discussion groups and sites - of course, as I use my real name, people never believe that they are chatting with me!": "Lech",
  "Originally, I was in both software and in online computing. The first innovation really was sort of at that time that we're marrying the telephone and the computer so that people wouldn't have to drive to the computer center. We didn't have $1,000 computers.": "Sam",
  "I don't look at computers as opponents. For me it is much more interesting to beat humans.": "Magnus",
  "How can you allow the trading companies to locate computers closer to exchanges and flash millions of bids to give an unfair advantage?... Even professionals are losing faith in some aspects of the system.": "Mario",
  "One of the big first computers was called SAGE, which was a missile defense, the first missile-defense computer, which was, like, one of the first computers in the history of the world which got sold to the Department of Defense for, I don't know, tens and tens of millions of dollars at the time.": "Marc",
  "People are good at intuition, living our lives. What are computers good at? Memory.": "Eric",
  "Brains are tricky and adaptable organs. For all the 'neuroplasticity' allowing our brains to reconfigure themselves to the biases of our computers, we are just as neuroplastic in our ability to eventually recover and adapt.": "Douglas",
  "More and more people are seeing the films on computers - lousy sound, lousy picture - and they think they've seen the film, but they really haven't.": "David",
  "I fix my grandchildren's computers.": "Alan",
  "I started with CB radio, ham radio, and eventually went into computers. And I was just fascinated with it. And back then, when I was in school, computer hacking was encouraged. It was an encouraged activity. In fact, I remember one of the projects my teacher gave me was writing a log-in simulator.": "Kevin",
  "Computer science is one of the worst things that ever happened to either computers or to science.": "Neil",
  "I was around computers from birth; we had one of the first Macs, which came out shortly before I was born, and my dad ran a company that wrote computer operating systems. I don't think I have any particular technical skills; I just got a really large head start.": "Aaron",
  "I graduated from high school in 1963. There were no computers, cell phones, Internet, credit cards, cassette tapes or cable TV.": "Jeffrey",
  "Computers are very expensive and they need power, and that can be a problem in Africa.": "Mo",
  "Computers ought to help people find their own best path through lots of textual information.": "Mitch",
  "I think that technology - computers and smart phones and 24-hour availability - often leaves me, and others I know, feeling blank and depressed at the end of a day. I also believe that hyped expectations for raising children leaves many women and men feeling as if their days are a blur of carpools and play-groups and tutors.": "Rebecca",
  "I'm pretty much a dinosaur in the studio. I like things hand-drawn, even today. The story artists use Cintiqs, but I'm the only person who hasn't completely converted to computers. I like the Cintiq, but there's something about the raw emotional power of using paper and pencil.": "Walt",
  "Some computers have security software that make it impossible to hack into, and it's the same with brains - some malfunction, and some, you can't hack into them at all.": "Keith",
  "When I'm not writing or tweaking my computer, I do embroidery. When I'm not plunging into the past, tweaking, or embroidering, I'm reading books about history, computers, or embroidery.": "Lynn",
  "When I launched the development of the GNU system, I explicitly said the purpose of developing this system is so we can use our computers and have freedom, thus if you use some other free system instead but you have freedom, then it's a success. It's not popularity for our code but it's success for our goal.": "Richard",
  "Your car should drive itself. It's amazing to me that we let humans drive cars... It's a bug that cars were invented before computers.": "Eric",
  "I'm not very technically minded. I mean, I don't know how to do e-mail on computers.": "Kate",
  "My first synthesizer was the VCS3. I got it in Bristol in the late Sixties, long before Pink Floyd used them. I had to sell an acoustic guitar and an old reel-to-reel tape recorder to raise the money. You can do fantastic things with modern computers, but you cannot use them in the same intuitive, spontaneous way you can a VCS3.": "Jean-Michel",
  "Open-source encyclopedias such as Wikipedia and search engines such as Google and Bing, which people can tap into anytime and anywhere via computers and smart phones, put a world of knowledge at our fingertips at a lower cost than ever before.": "Naveen",
  "With faster Internet and better computers, you'd better believe we're creating and consuming more digital data.": "Peter",
  "Use a personal firewall. Configure it to prevent other computers, networks and sites from connecting to you, and specify which programs are allowed to connect to the net automatically.": "Kevin",
  "The early cyberpunk idea was that networked computers would let us do our work at home, as freelancers, and then transact directly with peers over networks. Digital technology would create tremendous slack, allow us to apply its asynchronous, decentralized qualities to our own work and lives.": "Douglas",
  "For many years, even as users became more sophisticated, personal computers took too much effort to use without problem-solving, keeping alive the yearning for greater simplicity. Microsoft's dominant Windows platform, in particular, was a home for all manner of bugs and problems that required IT people to straighten out.": "Walt",
  "No one has any faith in the tape anymore - everyone just relies on computers and considers the hardrive to be the safest option, and I don't. I think an analog tape is something you can hold.": "Dave",
  "I am very bad at computers. I don't really know how to write email.": "Marjane",
  "Bitcoin is not an actual physical coin, and if computers are shut down, you can't buy or sell them. That's why nothing will ever replace gold and silver coins themselves, and all investors should have them at home or in a safe deposit box.": "Mark",
  "Yes, I was a big math and computer geek, that's true. I was driven by the scholastic side of things. For me, it was all about what I could do with math and computers.": "Brian",
  "Well, the big products in electronics in the '50s were radio and television. The first big computers were just beginning to come in and represented the most logical market for us to work in.": "Jack",
  "I am cursed with computers something always goes wrong. ": "Carla",
  "In my view, the fact that computers caught up to humans and completely dominate humans in chess and some other domains already, that says there's evidence that, yes, in principle, they can be better programmers than humans.": "Jaan",
  "I think computers are the ultimate writing tool. I'm a very slow writer, so I appreciate it every day.": "Sherry",
  "I'm not really a knob-twiddler. I always work with an engineer I'm not super hands-on when it comes to mixing boards and computers. I'm much more about what I'm hearing and what it needs to be like. I deal with songs and ideas and instruments. ": "Danger",
  "Computers seem a little too adaptively flexible, like the strange natives, odd societies, and head cases we study in the social sciences. There's more opposable thumb in the digital world than I care for; it's awfully close to human.": "P.",
  "The reason we personify things like cars and computers is that just as monkeys live in an arboreal world and moles live in an underground world and water striders live in a surface tension-dominated flatland, we live in a social world.": "Richard",
  "There is no heaven or afterlife for broken-down computers that is a fairy story for people afraid of the dark. ": "Stephen",
  "Computers allow us to squeeze the most out of everything, whether it's Google looking up things, so I guess that tends to make us a little lazy about reading books and doing things the hard way to understand how those things work.": "Buzz",
  "Look at what Silicon Valley has done - the advance of computers.": "Buzz",
  "Computers absolutely changed my life. Before I had a computer, I had never written one thing. Not one thing. I'm a very bad speller and I was embarrassed by that. When I would type, the little mistakes would make me nutty, and I would never edit anything.": "Penn",
  "My love of computers, besides being practical, is very direct and visceral. I love the way things look on the screen.": "Penn",
  "The basis of computer work is predicated on the idea that only the brain makes decisions and only the index finger does the work.": "Brian",
  "When I first started making ambient music, I was setting up systems using synthesizers that generated pulses more or less randomly. The end result is a kind of music that continuously changes. Of course, until computers came along, all I could actually present of that work was a piece of its output.": "Brian",
  "If you want to make computers that really work, create a design team composed only of healthy, active women with lots else to do in their lives, and give them carte blanche.": "Brian",
  "Pop music can absorb so many peculiar talents, ranging from the completely nonmusical poseur who just uses music as a kind of springboard for a sense of style, to people who just love putting all that complicated stuff together, brick by brick, on their computers, to people like me who like playing conceptual games and being surprised.": "Brian",
  "I can live without endless television programmes and films just centered around computers. I can sort of live without that.": "Martin",
  "I just think people have a lot of fiction. But, you know, I mean, the real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded.": "Mark",
  "The real story of Facebook is just that we've worked so hard for all this time. I mean, the real story is actually probably pretty boring, right? I mean, we just sat at our computers for six years and coded.": "Mark",
  "With my wife Camille's help, I took to social networking. I'm working with the computers.": "Bill",
  "Sci-fi films are the epic films of the day because we can no longer put 10,000 extras in the scene - but we can draw thousands of aliens with computers.": "William",
  "Our computers double in capability on time scales of only a few years. It's hardly outrageous to believe that we will successfully develop thinking machines within a handful of decades, or at most a century or two. If that happens, these artificial sentients will quickly leave us behind.": "Seth",
  "The U.S. government doesn't build your computers, nor do you fly aboard a U.S. government owned and operated airline. Private industry routinely takes technologies pioneered by the government and turns them into cheap, reliable and robust industries. This has happened in aviation, air mail, computers, and the Internet.": "Peter",
  "One thing that humans still do better than computers is recognize images.": "Peter",
  "I'm a Luddite with computers, and I'm slightly worried about being hacked as well.": "Jo",
  "'Bloomberg's, you know, for people who don't use the service, provides through the Internet - through specialized computers - information about the financial world. It's a very large data base. I think they have on the order of a billion dollars or more a year in revenue.": "Craig",
  "I'm not really gadget oriented. I'm not into technology or computers. I'm not good at interfacing with that sort of gear.": "Nicolas",
  "I just like music that sounds like music. Not like machines and computers and things that you design to make things sound slick and perfect.": "Zooey",
  "Ignorance breeds antipathy. Until I got to know how computers worked, I didn't want anything to do with them. I said, 'Well, why do I need them? I write letters.' Which I still do.": "Viggo",
  "Stock exchanges say that more than half of all trades are now executed by just a handful of high-frequency traders, who use rapid-fire computers to essentially force slower investors to give up profits, then disappear before anyone knows what happened.": "Charles",
  "Pixar is not about computers, it's about people.": "John",
  "If you take a regular animated film, that's being done by animators on computers, so the filmmaking is a fairly technical process.": "Peter",
  "Economics pretends to be a science. Its practitioners fill blackboards with equations and clog computers with data. But it is really a faith, or more accurately a set of overlapping and squabbling faiths, each with its own doctrines.": "Alex",
  "Most computers today have built in backup software.": "Barton",
  "I favor pocket-sized hard drives that travel between home and office, syncing with computers on both ends.": "Barton",
  "Dell fills its computers with crapware, collecting fees from McAfee and other vendors to pre-install 'trial' versions.": "Barton",
  "Given the volume of PC sales and the way McAfee runs its operation, I imagine there must be thousands of phantom subscribers - folks who signed up once upon a time and left the software behind two or three computers ago.": "Barton",
  "Perhaps one day we will have machines that can cope with approximate task descriptions, but in the meantime, we have to be very prissy about how we tell computers to do things.": "Richard",
  "I've never had Internet access. Actually, I have looked at things on other people's computers as a bystander. A few times in my life I've opened email accounts, twice actually, but it's something I don't want in my life right now.": "Jhumpa",
  "Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs founded Apple Inc, which set the computing world on its ear with the Macintosh in 1984.": "Kevin",
  "It was used for decades to describe talented computer enthusiasts, people whose skill at using computers to solve technical problems and puzzles was - and is - respected and admired by others possessing similar technical skills.": "Kevin",
  "If I wasn't a professional scientist, I'd be an amateur scientist. But plan B was to go into computers.": "Michio",
  "I have nothing against investment banking, but it's like massaging money rather than creating money. If you're in physics, you create inventions, you create lasers, you create transistors, computers, GPS.": "Michio",
  "Your computer needn't be the first thing your see in the morning and the last thing you see at night.": "Simon",
  "Everyone knows, or should know, that everything we type on our computers or say into our cell phones is being disseminated throughout the datasphere. And most of it is recorded and parsed by big data servers. Why do you think Gmail and Facebook are free? You think they're corporate gifts? We pay with our data.": "Douglas",
  "Not only have computers changed the way we think, they've also discovered what makes humans think - or think we're thinking. At least enough to predict and even influence it.": "Douglas",
  "The reason why Apple computers have worked so well over time is that, unlike Microsoft, they don't bend over backward to be compatible with every piece of hardware or software in the digital universe. To code or create for Apple, you follow Apple's rules. If you're even allowed to.": "Douglas",
  "I have a crazy amount of different jobs, so the way I manage that is to not do more than one at a time. It's like old computers that had small memory chips, they would do something called swapping, where they would fill the memory with one task, do it and get it out.": "Louis",
  "Every one of today's smartphones has thousands of times more processing power than the computers that guided astronauts to the moon.": "Peter",
  "I'm interested in all kinds of pictures, however they are made, with cameras, with paint brushes, with computers, with anything.": "David",
  "India for sure is a mobile-first country. But I don't think it will be a mobile-only country for all time. An emerging market will have more computing in their lives, not less computing, as there is more GDP and there is more need. As they grow, they will also want computers that grow from their phone.": "Satya",
  "I know when I grew up, it was, if it was daylight outside, get outside. Well, now, with the technological age of computers and everything, everyone's inside virtually going everywhere they want to go, virtually having relationships, virtually traveling across the neighborhood, virtually going to that island.": "Matthew",
  "Companies are accustomed to dismissing employees for misuse of computers at work.": "Bill",
  "I wouldn't know how to find eBay on the computer if my life depended on it.": "Marc",
  "When I helped to develop the open standards that computers use to communicate with one another across the Net, I hoped for but could not predict how it would blossom and how much human ingenuity it would unleash.": "Vint",
  "I'm projecting somewhere between 100 million and 200 million computers on the Net by the end of December 2000, and about 300 million users by that same time.": "Vint",
  "The future of television is not on television but online. A majority of us are turning to our computers and mobile devices for news and entertainment, Millennials especially.": "Jason",
  "Everybody jokes about that old story about the world only needing five computers, but when you think about it, that's where we're heading.": "Matt",
  "Regardless of how it's done, transaction costs will continue to plummet as computers get more powerful. Low transaction costs are a wonderful thing if you're in the transaction business. They're wonderful for consumers too, making it cheaper and easier to buy things and creating new things to buy.": "Nathan",
  "Why pay a fee for Internet content when a million free sites are just a click away? There's no incentive until people are too addicted to the Net to turn off their computers, yet are bored with what's available.": "Nathan",
  "The whole hardware industry has experienced the phenomenon in which every time computers get cheaper, they appeal to a new set of users; every time they get more powerful, old customers upgrade.": "Nathan",
  "I am not great at computers. If I were to try shopping through Google, I'd end up with 33 vests.": "Mary",
  "Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better.": "Marc",
  "People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the D.M.V. and look around, you're like, Oh, my God, I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers.": "Marc",
  "Technology is like water; it wants to find its level. So if you hook up your computer to a billion other computers, it just makes sense that a tremendous share of the resources you want to use - not only text or media but processing power too - will be located remotely.": "Marc",
  "Google is working on self-driving cars, and they seem to work. People are so bad at driving cars that computers don't have to be that good to be much better. Any time you stand in line at the DMV and look around, you're like, 'Oh, my God, I wish all these people were replaced by computer drivers.'": "Marc",
  "We believe the singularity is inevitable, and all businesses will be redefined as computers overtake humans in intelligence.": "Masayoshi",
  "I understand that computers, which I once believed to be but a hermaphrodite typewriter-cum-filing cabinet, offer the cyber literate increased ability to communicate. I do not think this is altogether a bad thing, however it may appear on the surface.": "David",
  "My background was in graphic design, but when I was doing it, it was all hand-drawn stuff, not computers.": "Jeffrey",
  "I hate the thought of my children being glued to a screen. Children only play on computers all day because their parents let them.": "Mariella",
  "There's no other major item most of us own that is as confusing, unpredictable and unreliable as our personal computers.": "Walt",
  "My first computers were a Timex Sinclair and an Apple II.": "Walt",
  "I am a child of digital generation. I have done most of the records with Rilo Kiley on computers, on Pro Tools or other digital programs.": "Jenny",
  "The form of computers has never been important, with speed and performance being the only things that mattered.": "Jonathan",
  "I wonder what would have happened if automation and computers had existed when 'Oklahoma!' was having its out-of-town try-out, and three days before closing in Boston, when it was still called 'Away We Go,' they added a new song called 'Oklahoma!' I don't think that could happen today. It's almost impossible to change musicals on the go now.": "Andrew",
  "Some claim that computers will, by 2050, achieve human capabilities. Of course, in some respects they already have.": "Martin",
  "Some things, like the orbits of the planets, can be calculated far into the future. But that's atypical. In most contexts, there is a limit. Even the most fine-grained computation can only forecast British weather a few days ahead. There are limits to what can ever be learned about the future, however powerful computers become.": "Martin",
  "Would you go into a CD store and steal a CD? It's the same thing, people going into the computers and loggin' on and stealing our music.": "Britney",
  "We resemble computers intellectually and animals emotionally.": "Mother",
  "I don't know where anyone ever got the idea that technology, in and of itself, was a savior. Like all human-created 'progress,' computers are problematic, giving and taking away.": "Ellen",
  "Closed environments dominated the computing world of the 1970s and early '80s. An operating system written for a Hewlett-Packard computer ran only on H.P. computers I.B.M. controlled its software from chips up to the user interfaces. ": "Ellen",
  "People talk about computer programmers as if computers are our whole lives. That's simply not true.": "Ellen",
  "A computer is a general-purpose machine with which we engage to do some of our deepest thinking and analyzing. This tool brings with it assumptions about structuredness, about defined interfaces being better. Computers abhor error.": "Ellen",
  "Introduced in the 1960s, multitasking is an engineering strategy for making computers more efficient. Human beings are the slowest elements in a system.": "Ellen",
  "Everyone talks about how much data's in the world. Except, actually, 80% of it is pretty blind to computers. I mean, it can store it. But if it's a movie, a poem, a song, it doesn't know what it's actually saying or doing.": "Ginni",
  "At home, we're listening to TV or playing with our computers, so our entertaining is rusting. We don't know how to be good hosts and guests in business situations.": "Letitia",
  "The idea that computers can ever replace teachers and schools reveals a deep lack of understanding about the role leadership plays in student success.": "Wendy",
  "People need to get out and do some more exercise, especially children who are stuck inside with computers.": "Katie",
  "I think the only reason people use PCs is because they have to. Mac is the most streamlined computer there is. I started using the Mac in college because I was doing editing, and they were the only computers we could use to do that.": "Cary",
  "The way we live is changing. Each year, our free time shrinks a little more as computers clamor for an increasing percentage of our attention.": "Ruth",
  "I loathe computers more and more, so I have one I can shut down and shelve like a book.": "Will",
  "The whole aesthetics of computers very much feeds into my OCD. They fill my head with obsessionalities and my actions become very repetitive. It seems quite inimical to the dreamy state out of which fiction comes which seems so much less causally repetitive than the way one works on computers.": "Will",
  "Computers intimidate me.": "Dylan",
  "Well, I had a lot of help from my father with the soldering and so on, and he was very good at math and was fascinated with computers, and so I was fortunate enough to have a bunch of exposure going all the way back to high school - this was in the 1960s.": "Mitch",
  "I give Bill Gates an A for vision because, as a business person and a strategist, he's brilliant. His flaw is that his view is not informed by a humanistic or compassionate vision of how to make computers work for people.": "Mitch",
  "In 2004, the iPod was a novelty, and tablet computers were a dream. Now we take for granted that we can see whatever we want whenever and wherever we want to see it, be it 'Grand Illusion' or 'Duck Dynasty.'": "Terry",
  "In the early 1990s, Americans used their home phone lines to connect their desktop computers to the Internet via ISPs like AOL, Earthlink, or Netzero. Back then, the ISPs didn't have cost-effective technology to select particular sites for blocking or privileging.": "Marvin",
  "Shareware tends to combine the worst of commercial software with the worst of free software.": "Linus",
  "You have to be very skilled in this industry. I grew in this industry we created the very beginnings of this industry. We made the first PCs (personal computers) in the world. ": "Shiv",
  "I was born in Tamil Nadu. I built HCL in UP. The first computers of the world were built in UP, and the UP government has supported us all through.": "Shiv",
  "When I got out of coaching, I had taught a class at the University of California, an extension class on football for fans. I was looking for tools. I was showing them films. I was going to write a textbook. Trip Hawkins came to me about making it a game for computers.": "John",
  "Computers have cut-and-paste functions. So does right-wing historical memory.": "Rick",
  "I've always shied away from computers, the Internet and all that. I'm a bit more traditional, really - pick up a newspaper, pick up a phone.": "Bradley",
  "In the past, Google has used teams of humans to 'read' its street address images - in essence, to render images into actionable data. But using neural network technology, the company has trained computers to extract that data automatically - and with a level of accuracy that meets or beats human operators.": "John",
  "I am not the only person who uses his computer mainly for the purpose of diddling with his computer.": "Dave",
  "As a child, I did what any normal kid who grew up without any electricity would do - I spent countless hours working on a computer wired to my parents' car battery... and learned how to code. This natural passion for computers lead me into the Internet market during the late 1990s and early 2000s.": "Ryan",
  "Social media has come a long way. With the good has come some bad, and you always have a lot of people hiding behind their computers and being very critical of what you do on and off the field, of what you tweet, of what you say, of everything you do.": "Alex",
  "A lot of journalists like to suck up to celebrities, and then as soon as they're a safe distance away at their computers, they take shots. But that's the way society has become, especially in pop culture.": "Scott",
  "All my kids were raised on computers: They were home-schooled on the Internet, so they're pretty good at that stuff. And I'm proud of them, but I don't really keep up with it.": "Willie",
  "You have riches and freedom here but I feel no sense of faith or direction. You have so many computers, why don't you use them in the search for love?": "Lech",
  "I believe China is a major trade violator. The Chinese break all the rules. They counterfeit our goods, steal our international property rights, and hack the computers of our industries and government. Something must be done about it.": "Lawrence",
  "I've never really been very interested in computers themselves. I don't watch them I watch how people behave around them. That's becoming more difficult to do because everything is around them. ": "William",
  "Computers shouldn't be parents, but they are. Please, spend time with your kids. If you don't want to, then I don't want to. It might hurt you to discipline your offspring, but it saves the child from being disciplined later by someone less forgiving. Like a criminal court judge. If you don't spank your child, someone else will.": "GloZell",
  "Computers tend to separate us from each other - Mum's on the laptop, Dad's on the iPad, teenagers are on Facebook, toddlers are on the DS, and so on.": "Tom",
  "I am not one of the new media experts working all the time with my computers and the PowerPoints and things of that sort.": "Ahmed",
  "Everyone has this perception that the bloggers, they say horrible things about you and they hide behind their computers where you can't see them.": "L'Wren",
  "Millions of nerdy kids who grew up in the 1980s could only find the components they needed at local Radio Shacks, and the stores were like a lifeline to a better world where everybody understood computers.": "Annalee",
  "Bounty hunters these days - because everything is so sophisticated with computers and surveillance, it doesn't have to be a one-man-army-type guy who goes in and kicks a door down.": "Mickey",
  "We're getting so pulled in by computers and technology, and our kids have their face in the computers all day. The human relationship is being diminished by this.": "Lenny",
  "I always loved computers - it's something inside you.": "George",
  "Most people are excited about themselves. Personal genome will deliver for inexpensively something about science to which you can relate. Just like computers are becoming something to which you can relate. It should be even easier to relate to your own biology, and I hope that will be one of the ways we get broader literacy in science.": "George",
  "This is a man who was 23 years old when he theorized the idea of creating a programmable machine, and in that way, Turing foresaw computers and artificial intelligence. These were revolutionary ideas at that time.": "Morten",
  "Personal computers were created by some teenagers in garages because the, the wisdom of the computer industry was that people didn't want these little toys on their desk.": "Howard",
  "Technologies evolve in the strangest ways. Computers were created to calculate ballistics equations, and now we use them to create amusing illusions. Creating amusing illusions is a big business if you play it right.": "Howard",
  "My father raised me to build computers, hardware. Literally, as an 8 year old, I had a soldering iron and circuit boards, and this was in neighbourhoods that wouldn't have a whole lot of money or anything. And I figured out ways to just hustle.": "Jidenna",
  "Man, I don't want to have nothing to do with computers. I don't want the government in my business.": "Erykah",
  "People assume that computers will do everything that humans do. Not good. People are different from each other and they are all really different from computers.": "Eric",
  "I've come to a view that humans will continue to do what we do well, and that computers will continue to do what they do very well, and the two will coexist, but in different spaces.": "Eric",
  "At our computer club, we talked about it being a revolution. Computers were going to belong to everyone, and give us power, and free us from the people who owned computers and all that stuff.": "Steve",
  "When I was growing up, I had lots of smart classmates that were girls, but none of us were really pushed into math or computers or anything like that. Girls took AP history and AP English and AP European history. And boys took calculus and physics.": "Aileen",
  "There's no telling how many guns we have in America - and when one gets used in a crime, no way for the cops to connect it to its owner. The only place the police can turn for help is a Kafkaesque agency in West Virginia, where, thanks to the gun lobby, computers are illegal and detective work is absurdly antiquated.": "Jeanne",
  "Strangely enough, the linking of computers has taken place democratically, even anarchically. Its rules and habits are emerging in the open light, rather shall behind the closed doors of security agencies or corporate operations centers.": "James",
  "My advice is not always so logical and consistent. But then, love is not logical and consistent. So why should my advice be? If you want that kind of thinking, go to a computer. Computers are always logical and consistent, and you see how often they get proposed to.": "Zsa",
  "Beatbullying's 'The Big March 2012' is such a brilliant campaign and I am very proud to be a part of it. I have been a victim of cyber bullying myself and I know firsthand just how hurtful it can be. People think that they can hide behind computers and send nasty and hurtful comments to people, and this is wrong.": "Katherine",
  "GIS started on mainframe computers; we could get one map every five to 10 hours, and if we made a mistake, it could take longer. In the early '90s, when people started buying PCs, we migrated to desktop software.": "Jack",
  "I went on to Harvard and got very interested in computers and studying the earth's landscape.": "Jack",
  "I'm a computer guy, and one of the things I did with the good fortune that 'Presumed Innocent' brought me was to buy one of the very first laptop computers. It weighed about eight and a half pounds, by the way.": "Scott",
  "The technological revolution at home makes it much easier for computers to do our work.": "Fareed",
  "I'm pretty into computers. I used to be a lot more into it when I was younger.": "Cameron",
  "I detest computers. If you had a device like that 30 years ago that froze up constantly, misbehaved constantly, lost your information and screwed up when you needed it the most, it would have been laughable.": "Tom",
  "There are more clocks than ever - clocks on computers, on cell phones, on televisions, on any screen available, telling time to the digital second - but they all seem to matter less.": "Stacey",
  "Nobody expects that just because they've made computers better they're going to give them to you free.": "Dean",
  "I wouldn't call myself a geek, but I do sometimes teach Mommy and Daddy stuff about computers. And I do watch TV, but only informative programmes like the news and documentaries.": "Adora",
  "Nowadays shots are created in post-production, on computers. It's not really photography.": "Mary",
  "I think I compose as a listener: improvising and listening back excites me because I get to ideas that never would have occurred. Then I bring in the computers and samplers... and I begin to loop and process and change them.": "Thomas",
  "Everywhere I look, there are ads marking Mother's Day. Mostly they conform to stereotype: flowers, jewelry, perfume. Not a lot of books. Not many computers. Few tools. Little that's useful.": "Margaret",
  "This is an anxiety driven world - the whole world is driven by anxiety. It is anxiety about the aftermath of the global financial crisis it's anxiety about inequality and about computers replacing jobs. ": "Robert",
  "The only thing I do on a computer is play Texas Hold 'Em, really. Obviously my cell phone is a computer. My car is a computer. I'm on computers every day without actively seeking them out.": "John",
  "I am of the very last generation who didn't have computers at school. As we grow old we'll become something of an aberration.": "Steve",
  "The iPhone is made on a global scale, and it blends computers, the Internet, communications, and artificial intelligence in one blockbuster, game-changing innovation. It reflects so many of the things that our contemporary world is good at - indeed, great at.": "Tyler",
  "We're seeing an enormous amount of global upward mobility that's quite rapid and quite sudden, and undiscovered individuals have a chance - using the Internet, using computers - to prove themselves very quickly. So I think the mobility story will be a quite complicated one.": "Tyler",
  "When humans team up with computers to play chess, the humans who do best are not necessarily the strongest players. They're the ones who are modest and who know when to listen to the computer. Often, what the human adds is knowledge of when the computer needs to look more deeply.": "Tyler",
  "In chess, computers show that what we call 'strategy' is reducible to tactics, ultimately. It only looks creative to us. They are still just glorified cash registers. This should make us feel uncomfortable, whether or not we think computers will ever be good composers of music or artistic painters.": "Tyler",
  "In the past, missionaries have traveled to far countries with the message of the gospel - with great hardship and often with the loss of life. In contrast, we can reach millions instantly from the comfort of our homes by merely hitting the 'send' button on our computers, or with iPads, or phones.": "Ray",
  "I can write anywhere. But I don't use a computer, and I could never write on a laptop. I hate the sound of computers; it's too dull, like it's not doing anything for you.": "Elmore",
  "For about half an hour in mid-1992, I knew as much as any layperson about the pleasures of remote access of other people's computers.": "Elizabeth",
  "I think our problems are inherently unsolvable. We need to change our genetic make-up or create computers that will think us out of it. I don't think humans are able to deal with what we have.": "Neill",
  "When I write a song, I always start on acoustic guitar, because that's a good test of a song, when it's really open and bare. You can often mislead yourself if you start with computers and samples and programming because you can disguise a bad song.": "Martin",
  "It was not until the appearance of cyberpunk in the 1980s that SF began to grapple in a broadly meaningful way with the reality of computers as something other than giant mainframes tended by crewcut IBM nerds.": "Paul",
  "That's what happens nowadays with people working on computers. They can so easily fix things with their mouse and take out all the, 'Oh, somebody coughed in the background; we need to take that out' - or somebody hit a bad note. Those are all the best moments.": "Jack",
  "Yeah, computers are going to take over the programming business because they have become so fast recently that they can solve the Halting Problem in five seconds flat.": "Craig",
  "Charlestoning is hard. People were fit in the '20s to be able to do that. I guess they didn't sit in front of their computers all day.": "Elizabeth",
  "There's an evolution from, today we tell computers to do stuff for us, to where computers can actually do stuff for us. For example, if I go and pick up my kids, it would be good for my car to be aware that my kids have entered the car and change the music to something that's appropriate for them.": "Sundar",
  "We carry around computers in our pockets. Many people barely use them as phones. We use them as computers. If you think about the future, when you're traveling around, it's great to have a lightweight, small form factor.": "Mitchell",
  "I'm impressed by the way some illustrators develop their images on computers, but it's too late for me to start, and I'm still in love with paper and paint and pencils.": "Anthony",
  "I want people to come to me open and vulnerable. When they come to the gallery, they have to leave their watches, their computers, their Blackberrys, iPads, iPhones, because we are so incredibly used to technology, and I wanted to remove that.": "Marina",
  "A smartphone is a computer - it's not built using a computer - the job it does is the job of being a computer. So, everything we say about computers, that the software you run should be free - you should insist on that - applies to smart phones just the same. And likewise to those tablets.": "Richard",
  "I truly believe that you have to bring more content to the table to survive in radio than saying, 'There was AC/DC, and here's Journey,' because computers can do that.": "Eddie",
  "I'm actually pretty good with computers. I use computers when I'm working on making and producing music, so I do know a thing or two!": "Nick",
  "I know so many people who actually just watch television on their computers now and don't even really watch their TV anymore.": "Busy",
  "Whatever they do, criminals and non-criminals act in particular ways. Some writers, for instance, use computers, others pen and paper. Some write in the morning, some at night. Each writer has a distinct style, with variations in grammar, sentence structure, and voice.": "Ronald",
  "I had been doing MP3 players and handheld computers since 1990-1991, and so they sought me out because of my experience. And about 18 generations of iPod and three generations of iPhone later, I decided to leave Apple.": "Tony",
  "Computers are great tools, but they need to be applied to the physical world.": "Tony",
  "Without computers, in the 17th century, we could classify the entire animal kingdom... there was this idea of the speciation, right? And now, all a search engine is is essentially the mathematical speciation of ideas - and these things really derive from the way that language is used and the way words relate.": "Joshua",
  "Elon Musk is talking about silicon nanoparticles pulsing through our veins to make us sort of semi-cyborg computers. But why not take a noninvasive approach? I've been working and trying to think and invent a way to do this for a number of years and finally happened upon it and left Facebook to do it.": "Mary",
  "I've found that people who design computers don't know a lot about displays.": "Mary",
  "When I heard the news that Steve Jobs had died, my mind flashed back to 1985, when I began my love affair with computers. I was stationed in Moscow for The Associated Press, and I ordered an Apple IIc - by Telex - from a department store in Helsinki, Finland. They express-shipped it to me, a month later, by train.": "Andrew",
  "I have sometimes thought the power of computers had exceeded our ability to use them, but Mr. Jobs and his team kept giving us devices that made indispensable things easier in ways you never thought of.": "Andrew",
  "You have to wait for people to program you. The only difference is the amount of people that you're going to reach but that's going to even out in the next two or three years anyway. Computers are being bought faster than televisions right now.": "Chuck",
  "Silicon Valley is a great place for Bitcoin, since everyone understands computers, and there are lots of libertarians running around.": "Roger",
  "I didn't want there to be a computer on stage. When I see people with computers on stage, I think, 'Are you sending e-mail?' That's so corny.": "Pat",
  "With our work at Kazaa, we began seeing growing broadband connections and more powerful computers and more streaming multimedia, and we saw that the traditional way of communicating by phone no longer made a lot of sense.": "Niklas",
  "I always have traveled with a camera throughout my life, but I always had my old 35mm film camera. When I was training to go into space, the only equipment there was a digital camera. I went through a fast-track class on Earth. It actually was fun, though I'm basically a dinosaur with computers.": "Guy",
  "I'd like to think life has improved since 1850, despite the long hours we all seem to spend slaving over hot computers, but the psychological journeys remain the same - the search for love, identity, a meaningful place in the world.": "Meg",
  "In effect, the Internet is a global connection of interconnected computers. It has been described as truly a peer-to-peer system with many distributed nodes and no central point of control architecture.": "Miriam",
  "If you write a blog post, you've got something to say; you're not just creating words and synonyms. We'd like the computers to actually pick up on that semantic meaning.": "Ray",
  "I'm working on artificial intelligence. Actually, natural language understanding, which is to get computers to understand the meaning of documents.": "Ray",
  "But computers have changed the world for everyone, so there will be some way of working it out.": "Debbie",
  "I was using computers for music in the '70s, '80s and '90s, and people didn't get it. They thought you should only use computers for your taxes and making pie charts.": "Buffy",
  "Keep in mind that there are computers, that do touch things up. Like when I got a hold of the poster for 'Gold Diggers,' I said: 'Hey, wait a minute! Those aren't my teeth!'": "Anna",
  "When I grew up we had gym at school, two or three dance classes after school, ice skating lessons, and all sorts of sports at our finger tips. We weren't glued to computers because they didn't exist, so being active was all we knew.": "Lisa",
  "I was a 'Duck Hunt' and 'Mario' guy, and stuff like that. I was never technologically driven. I never had all the cool, new toys. I was the youngest child, I wasn't the only child, so I wasn't spoiled as a kid. And, we were on the farm, so we didn't have a lot. Also, with computers, I'm not very good with them. I just check my email.": "Garrett",
  "I am not a great fan of computers. I do watch videos and analyse which batsman is playing how. Batsmen can play different shots on different days. A batsman may not play cover drives well, but if he connects with two such shots, he starts playing the drive well on that day.": "Harbhajan",
  "I got into computers back in the early '80s, so it was a natural progression of learning about e-mail in the mid-'80s and getting into the Internet when it opened up in the early '90s.": "Roger",
  "I'm a very methodical writer. Before computers, I used reams of paper and stacks of index cards.": "Frank",
  "I'm not afraid of computers taking over the world.": "Thom",
  "I'm really anti-option, so computers have been my nightmare with recording. I don't want endless tracks; I want less tracks. I want decisions to be made.": "Ian",
  "I am a huge supporter for cash for caulkers - which allows people to make improvement for energy efficient in their homes. We should do the same for Americans purchasing appliances and computers and for that matter, new air-conditioner and heating units.": "Harold",
  "As smartphones have allowed us to have our computers, emails, social media feeds, and a full surveillance system in our pockets at all times, stories of the law enforcement's unease with that have been popping up in the press. And of course, the ones that become viral videos aren't exactly flattering for law enforcement.": "Sarah",
  "Bill Gates is the pope of the personal computer industry. He decides who's going to build.": "Larry",
  "The great advance of personal computers was not the computing power per se but the fact that it brought it right to your face, that you had control over it, that were confronted with it and could steer it.": "Kevin",
  "Stationery gets me excited because it has an individual character, unlike computers, which may be convenient but are generic and bland.": "Damon",
  "Than Shwe ordered the confiscation of all cell phones and laptops and computers so no reportage could come out of Burma. It seemed clear that a demon, something diabolical, rather than something compassionate and human was in charge of Burma.": "Clarissa",
  "I was nerdy and really into computers. I was a good student until my senior year, when I started traveling and had a lot of absences.": "Tony",
  "There is a difference between the stuff that people put online themselves, like pictures and their trips and flights and meals they've eaten, than the stuff that they don't realize is also going into foreign computers. Like, for example, copies of your emails or every single online search you ever do, 'cause all that is being recorded as well.": "Mikko",
  "I honestly believe that people sit behind their computers and just get really brave.": "Leslie",
  "The ownership of computers in the home is far less than the statistics show, because usually when the computer breaks down once, that is the end of it for a long, long time. They do not have the money or incentive to get the computer repaired.": "Major",
  "It's interesting to see what people are saying about me. I like keep up with the latest rumors! A while back there was a rumor that I was going to do a film with Demi Moore about the takeover of Commodore computers!": "Warwick",
  "When I left Apple, it had $2 billion of cash. It was the most profitable computer company in the world - not just personal computers - and Apple was the number one selling computer.": "John",
  "When I was 8 or 9, I started using bulletin board systems, which was the precursor to the Internet, where you'd dial into... a shared system and shared computers. I've had an email address since the late '80s, when I was 8 or 9 years old, and then I got on the Internet in '93 when it was first starting out.": "Aaron",
  "I think we are at the very beginning of high changes, not only in terms of digital film, but in the way the movies will be screened, whether they'll be screened on phones, on computers - on everything.": "Michel",
  "I didn't know much about computers. I still worked on a manual Olivetti typewriter.": "Mona",
  "I think there is an awful lot of technology for technology's sake. I have yet to be convinced by my husband that persuading our mobiles to talk to our computers is going to be quicker and more straightforward than scribbling a note in our kitchen diary.": "Jojo",
  "If the machines can take the drudgery out of it and just leave us with the joy of drawing, then that's the best of both worlds - and I'll use those computers!": "Don",
  "We think we're saving time with microwaves, cell phones, beepers, computers and voice mail, but often these things help us create the illusion of getting somewhere - and they foster a chain of constant activity. We're really just squeezing extra activity into every minute that we gain.": "Arlie",
  "The humanitarian developers behind World of Warcraft have also discovered a way to bribe gamers into turning off their computers and going outside. If you log off for a few days, your character will be more 'rested' when you resume playing, a mode that temporarily speeds up your leveling.": "Clive",
  "More than any other modern tool, computers are a total mystery to their users. Most people never open them up to fix them or to see how they work.": "Clive",
  "The capacity of computers is doubling every eight months. It's exponential development. I think it's a real threat, actually, that a computer one day will be more intelligent than us.": "David",
  "Computers will be able to do all the mundane tasks in our daily lives.": "Aaron",
  "It seems like everything that we see perceived in the brain before we actually use our own eyes, that everything we see is coming through computers or machines and then is being input in our brain cells. So that really worries me.": "Hayao",
  "Computers were never designed in the first place to become musical instruments. Within a computer, everything is sterile - there's no sound, there's no air. It's totally code. Like with computer-generated effects in movies, you can create wonders. But it's really hard to create emotion.": "Thomas",
  "The manufacture and running of all the world's computers, the toxicity of the hardware mountains that we currently dump on other countries; all this can be totted up on the environmental account of web-users and its authors.": "Tristram",
  "I thought of computers as very low class. I thought of myself as a pure mathematician and was interested in partial differential equations and topology and things like that.": "Whitfield",
  "The trick with computers I think, is to approach old and new things with the same reverence as you would like your favourite chair and not be seduced by the constant innovation otherwise you never do anything.": "Colin",
  "One of the problems with computers, particularly for the older people, is they were befuddled by them, and the computers have gotten better. They have gotten easier to use. They have gotten less expensive. The software interfaces have made things a lot more accessible.": "Steve",
  "Our relationships with our computers are almost sexual, they're so close. They're just such a huge part of our lives.": "Mackenzie",
  "Reading computer manuals without the hardware is as frustrating as reading sex manuals without the software.": "Arthur",
  "Computers can bully us. A slow and unreliable system will bring even the toughest soul to their knees as they find themselves completely defenseless against the erratic whims of their rogue machine.": "Lou",
  "Computers have virtually replaced tape recorders.": "Tony",
  "China has legally purchased high performance computers, advanced machine tools, and semiconductor-manufacturing equipment from several American companies.": "Charles",
  "Educated women armed with computers have defeated extremists by denying them a monopoly to define cultural identity and interpret religious texts. No extremist can say that women are inferior to men without being made a laughingstock on Al Jazeera. Islam insisted on equality between everyone.": "Fatema",
  "It appears that the media filters we carry in our heads are like computers: they've been forced to get faster in order to keep up with the demands our high-speed society puts on them.": "Roy",
  "My parents had a software company making children's software for the Apple II+, Commodore 64 and Acorn computers. They hired these teenagers to program the software, and these guys were true hackers, trying to get more colors and sound and animation out of those computers.": "Bre",
  "Every ISP is being attacked, maliciously both from in the United States and outside of the United States, by those who want to invade people's privacy. But more importantly they want to take control of computers, they want to hack them, they want to steal information.": "Darrell",
  "We didn't know the importance of home computers before the Internet. We had them mostly for fun, then the Internet came along and was enabled by all the PCs out there.": "Burt",
  "Every company that made computers when we started the Mac, they're all gone.": "Phil",
  "I just became one with my browser software.": "Bill",
  "Well, we didn't have our original drummer on our last record. And most of that album was not played as a band in the studio. It was mostly the world of computers and overdubs. There was very few things played live or worked out as a band.": "James",
  "We are the greatest computers in this world, but now we've created the smart phone which is smarter than us now, but we're still making dumb decisions. We have given our creations more power than we have, and that to me is dumb.": "Bootsy",
  "Most of the musicians that I know almost to the man everybody uses Apple computers. They've thought of the steps that you're going to think of when you're trying to create your thing. And that's where the tools get invented to make better art.": "Mike",
  "By the time I was a senior in high school, I knew I wanted to move to Silicon Valley and learn more about computers and the Internet. I just fell in love with technology and the potential of everything the Internet had to offer.": "Brit",
  "But I'm so slow on it because I find it terribly hard writing blind on computers. The computer speaks to me, but it's just so slow, I'm so terribly slow using it.": "Jack",
  "I don't take for granted all the blessings that I have, and as soon as I heard about Computers for Youth, I really wanted to be involved. Anyone who knows me knows how much time I spend on computers. I'm a computer addict. Every young person deserves to have a computer in his or her home.": "Bow",
  "I would rather have racing without computers. The human side is forgotten, and instead of talking over what's happening and just trusting the feel of the driver, the data becomes almost more important.": "Jacques",
  "Lighter computers and lighter sensors would let you have more function in a given weight, which is very important if you are launching things into space, and you have to pay by the pound to put things there.": "Ralph",
  "I'm not on Twitter or Facebook and don't even use email. I don't trust computers: one day they'll all break down, and everyone will be knackered.": "Eric",
  "I wish people would turn off their computers, go outside, talk to people, touch people, lick people, enjoy each other's company and smell each other on the rump.": "Tre",
  "The idea that so many kids eat rubbish and sit on computers all day long appals me and getting them into sport is a major way of getting them off computers and leading healthier lives.": "Kirsty",
  "I grew up around electronic instruments. To me, the turntable is an electronic device. At the same time, I had access to drum machines and keyboards through my uncle; then track recorders into computers. At an early age, I was messing with computers more than most hip-hop musicians.": "Ali",
  "It was a huge challenge to learn digital painting well enough so that computers don't pop into mind when one sees one.": "Berkeley",
  "As the Kindle's dread grip on digital publishing is challenged by tablet computers and Android smartphones, with their bright screens and high resolution, the need for illustration is growing.": "Chris",
  "Computers are famous for being able to do complicated things starting from simple programs.": "Seth",
  "I'm encouraging kids to use computers at their own pace to build aspirations.": "Sugata",
  "Something else has happened with computers.": "Seth",
  "What's happened with society is that we have created these devices, computers, which already can register and process huge amounts of information, which is a significant fraction of the amount of information that human beings themselves, as a species, can process.": "Seth",
  "I just think there's a general interest in the world of computers.": "Irwin",
  "I don't type on the computer or edit. Law students who went to law school really just a couple years after I did were brought up all on the computers and that's how they do it, but I was still part of the older school.": "John",
  "If your computer speaks English, it was probably made in Japan.": "Alan",
  "As a science fiction fan, I had always assumed that when computers supplemented our intelligence, it would be because we outsourced some of our memory to them. We would ask questions, and our machines would give oracular - or supremely practical - replies.": "Gary",
  "We've lost these qualities, these abilities to do something by hand. Some illustrators have it still, but it's just not art. We have photography. We have cameras and computers that do it better and faster.": "Gerhard",
  "Modern people are only willing to believe in their computers, while I believe in myself.": "Alain",
  "Those who believe that health is a commodity, on par with cars or computers, fail to grasp the basic economic lesson that health is very vulnerable to exposure to the markets, not least due to the profound asymmetries in power between the providers and consumers.": "Vikram",
  "We're just into toys, whether it's motorcycles or race cars or computers. I've got the Palm Pilot right here with me, I've got the world's smallest phone. Maybe it's just because I'm still a big little kid and I just love toys, you know?": "Catherine",
  "I continue to meet people who have had their Web pages hijacked, their browsers corrupted, in some cases, their children exposed to inappropriate material from these dangerous programs hidden in their family computers.": "Cliff",
  "One of the things that is not so good is that a decision was made long ago about the size of an IP address - 32 bits. At the time it was a number much larger than anyone could imagine ever having that many computers but it turned out to be to small.": "Jon",
  "I've always been interested in technology, but specifically how we can use machines to engage the imagination. I started using computers when I was young and was fascinated by creating rules and instructions that allow a computer to engage in a dialogue with humans. The stories found in the data all around us can do just that.": "Aaron",
  "As a kid, I was always into art at the same time as computers, and eventually I realised I was making more interesting stuff with my keyboard than with my hands. I really enjoyed modifying computer games more than playing them, so that got me into programming.": "Aaron",
  "When computers came along, I felt for the first time that I had the proper tools for the kind of theoretical work I wanted to do. So I moved over to that, and that got me into psychology.": "Herbert",
  "Computers sort of came around through games and toys. And you know, the first computer most people had in the house may have been a computer to play 'Pong,' a little microprocessor embedded, and then other games that came after that.": "Rodney",
  "Even in the developing parts of the world, kids take to computers like fish to water.": "Nicholas",
  "We've been working now with computers and education for 30 years, computers in developing countries for 20 years, and trying to make low-cost machines for 10 years. This is not a sudden turn down the road.": "Nicholas",
  "Because I believe that humans are computers, I conjectured that computers, like people, can have left- and right-handed versions.": "Philip",
  "Dad was very into electronics, robotics and computers, so I was interested in what he was doing.": "Rhianna",
  "Our lives sometimes depend on computers performing as predicted.": "Philip",
  "Over the eons I've been a fan of, and sucker for, each latest automated system to 'simplify' and 'bring order to' my life. Very early on this led me to the beautiful-and-doomed Lotus Agenda for my DOS computers, and Actioneer for the early Palm.": "James",
  "I was writing my Ph.D. in the late 1980s and was keeping an eye on what was happening in the world. It became obvious to me that Russia couldn't live without computers. I think I worked this out a year before anyone else. I started looking for people who could help import them.": "Bidzina",
  "In computers, we do all kinds of manual manipulations. We grab and drag icons. We click on and open windows. We pull down a screen. We stretch a screen. We scroll up and down.": "Louis",
  "Writing genetic code like we do software will usher in a completely new way of living for all of us. When this happens, our society will be as fundamentally changed as we have seen from the invention of computers.": "Arvind",
  "You can model experiments on computers now and then execute them, and you don't actually need a fully stocked lab.": "Arvind",
  "I've never been much of a computer guy at least in terms of playing with computers. Actually until I was about 11 I didn't use a computer for preparing for games at all. I was playing a bit online, was using the chess club mainly. Now, obviously, the computer is an important tool for me preparing for my games.": "Magnus",
  "I started on an Apple II, which I had bought at the very end of 1978 for half of my annual income. I made $4,500 a year, and I spent half of it on the computer.": "Bill",
  "Right at the start, when I was about 13 or 14, I only had an Amiga 500 Plus running a bit of tracker software called OctaMED. My brother was big into his computers, and when he moved up to a proper PC, I took charge of the Amiga.": "Calvin",
  "Comic books aren't nerdy. You'd have to be an idiot to think computers are nerdy.": "Adam",
  "If computers remain far worse than us at image recognition, a certain over-confident combination of man and machine can elsewhere take inaccuracy to a whole new level.": "Tom",
  "Movies began as a communal experience. Even though we now watch them as DVD's, sometimes alone on our computers, mostly in the history of cinema it has been a communal experience.": "Alison",
  "By the end of 1978, we had 11 partners and six franchisees, we were operating in 22 cities, and we had about 6,000 clients. We had left Electronic Accounting Systems and were doing our own processing on our own computers.": "Tom",
  "And it's here and it's ready and we can really revolutionize the way we educate our children with tablet computers, and I'm committed to doing whatever I can to speaking to whomever I can to send this signal - to pound this message home. Now is the time.": "LeVar",
  "Every piece of software written today is likely going to infringe on someone else's patent.": "Miguel",
  "When I write software, I know that it will fail, either due to my own mistake, or due to some other cause.": "Wietse",
  "You can involve yourself in electronics, computers, puzzles... there's a lot of creativity and brain working. There's a lot to model trains that people don't realize.": "Gary",
  "We can just assume they have much more and powerful, more advanced technology, all the new computers, everything could be much more easier and help them to build much more and many more nuclear weapons.": "Mordechai",
  "My e-mail address is actually my wife's e-mail address. I actually hate computers.": "Joe",
  "Art shows us that human beings still matter in a world where money talks the loudest, where computers know everything about us, and where robots fabricate our next meal and also our ride there.": "John",
  "I like stuff designed by dead people. The old designers. They always got it right because they didn't have to grow up with computers. All of the people that made the spoon and the dishes and the vacuum cleaner didn't have microprocessors and stuff. You could do a good design back then.": "John",
  "I don't really love computers.": "John",
  "While the recent addition of the National Guard providing a support role manning computers and cameras has allowed more Border Patrol agents to work the field, more agents are still needed.": "Timothy",
  "You couldn't have fed the '50s into a computer and come out with the '60s.": "Paul",
  "I'm a '70s mom, and my daughter is a '90s mom. I know a lot of women my age who are real computer freaks.": "Florence",
  "All of a sudden, if you think about the entire ecosystem of connected devices that can pull down information, access content and allow me to share and work and communicate, the vast majority now are not Windows computers. They are iPhones. They are iPads. They are Android devices.": "Aaron",
  "I'm a very simple person. I don't use computers.": "Carrie-Anne",
  "Access to computers and the Internet has become a basic need for education in our society.": "Kent",
  "I don't care how big and fast computers are, they're not as big and fast as the world.": "Herbert",
  "Gee, I am a complete Luddite when it comes to computers, I can barely log on!": "Jonathan",
  "People are on their computers more than watching TV, because you can only watch voyeur TV, which is basically what reality shows are, for so long.": "Stephen",
  "I like computers as a tool. I like them as an instrument. I think they're just pretty.": "Dallas",
  "My work was fairly theoretical. It was in recursive function theory. And in particular, hierarchies of functions in terms of computational complexity. I got involved in real computers and programming mainly by being - well, I was interested even as I came to graduate school.": "Dennis",
  "In the practical world of computing, it is rather uncommon that a program, once it performs correctly and satisfactorily, remains unchanged forever.": "Niklaus",
  "People who are more than casually interested in computers should have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like. Otherwise the programs they write will be pretty weird.": "Donald",
  "I got up with my wife, I sat down at the computer when she went to work, and I didn't stop until she got home.": "George",
  "I realized that I loved using computers to create something, but being an architect just wasn't going to keep me interested. The idea of a life spent obsessing over bathroom details for an Upper East Side penthouse was pretty depressing.": "Joseph",
  "We can't really know ourselves because we have not created ourselves. But we can know computers, we can know cars, because anything that we made, we can understand.": "Terrance",
  "I have three brothers and they're all into computers. They're all intellects. My mother would pay me a quarter a page to read a book and I couldn't make 50 cents. I just couldn't do it.": "Josh",
  "Once you acknowledge that human brains are basically made of atoms and acknowledge that atoms are governed by simple laws of physics, then there is no reasoning principle why computers couldn't do anything that people are doing, and we don't really see any evidence that this is not the case.": "Jaan",
  "I used to have the very standard worldview. I can easily identify with people who see computers getting faster and smarter, and technology getting more and more beneficial, without seeing the other side.": "Jaan",
  "I'm pretty adept with computers and Photoshop for my blog, and I found my style with a conversational voice and an image-ready column.": "Robert",
  "We've got to be delivering young people, and people that are getting reeducated, people who are getting reemployed, into the marketplace with skills to work together, to understand computers, and to be able to be a part of that 21st century economy.": "Ann",
  "After a semester or so, my infatuation with computers burnt out as quickly as it had begun.": "Eric",
  "It is an interesting fact that during my tour I was never allowed access to computers, radios, or anything else that I might damage through curiosity, or perhaps something more sinister.": "Robert",
  "From cell phones to computers, quality is improving and costs are shrinking as companies fight to offer the public the best product at the best price. But this philosophy is sadly missing from our health-care insurance system.": "John",
  "I like computers. I like the Internet. It's a tool that can be used. But don't be misled into thinking that these technologies are anything other than aspects of a degenerate economic system.": "Jerry",
  "I grew up before computers. Computers are changing things, not all for the good.": "Graham",
  "I happen to think that computers are the most important thing to happen to musicians since the invention of cat-gut which was a long time ago.": "Robert",
  "Computers are scary. They're nightmares to fix, lose our stuff, and, on occasion, they crash, producing the blue screen of death. Steve Jobs knew this. He knew that computers were bulky and hernia-inducing and Darth Vader black. He understood the value of declarative design.": "Wesley",
  "Video games and computers have become babysitters for kids.": "Taylor",
  "Over and over again, financial experts and wonkish talking heads endeavor to explain these mysterious, 'toxic' financial instruments to us lay folk. Over and over, they ignobly fail, because we all know that no one understands credit default obligations and derivatives, except perhaps Mr. Buffett and the computers who created them.": "Richard",
  "I'm always working. I don't really set limits. I tend to go in bursts. And in between, I'm doing my taxes, answering the phone, and all those kinds of things. I waste a lot of time. Computers take a lot of time. I love computers.": "Richard",
  "Computers are hierarchical. We have a desktop and hierarchical files which have to mean everything.": "Ted",
  "They were saying computers deal with numbers. This was absolutely nonsense. Computers deal with arbitrary information of any kind.": "Ted",
  "How did the economy produce all these amazing things that we have around us - computers and cell phones and so on? There were a bunch of ideas, and the good ones grew and prospered. And the bad ones were pretty ruthlessly weeded out.": "Tim",
  "Failure's inevitable. It happens all the time in a complex economy. And how did the economy produce all these amazing things that we have around us, computers and cell phones and so on? Well, the process was trial and error. There were a bunch of ideas, and the good ones grew and prospered, and the bad ones were pretty ruthlessly weeded out.": "Tim",
  "A wide variety of devices beyond personal computers are arriving, many of which will be used to browse the Web... The Flash engineering team has taken this on with a major overhaul of the mainstream Flash Player for a variety of devices.": "Kevin",
  "Even though most people won't be directly involved with programming, everyone is affected by computers, so an educated person should have a good understanding of how computer hardware, software, and networks operate.": "Brian",
  "It's important to be informed about issues like usability, reliability, security, privacy, and some of the inherent limitations of computers.": "Brian",
  "If I was designing a web site for elementary school children, I might have a much higher percentage of older computers with outdated browsers since keeping up with browser and hardware technology has not traditionally been a strong point of most elementary schools.": "Mike",
  "So a more sensible thing it seemed to me was to go to Silicon Valley and be pushing on the technology companies to accelerate the use of audio and music in computers.": "Thomas",
  "Computers have become more friendly, understandable, and lots of years and thought have been put into developing software to convince people that they want and need a computer.": "Roberta",
  "Today, computers help us making the music. It's really a tool.": "Yael",
  "If somebody had told me when I was in graduate school, 'Brian, in 35 years you'll get a chance to fly the first commercial spacecraft with no computers,' I'd have said, 'I don't think so. People are not going to be that stupid.'": "Brian",
  "I do two things. I design mobile computers and I study brains.": "Jeff",
  "Kids today are smarter than we ever were. And they've got computers, too, which is awesome. They're scary to me.": "David",
  "Computers get better faster than anything else ever.": "Erik",
  "I worked at a local country club that I never belonged to. I did random tasks in the pro shop and supposed to be in charge of the register, but that didn't go so well. They quickly realized I was better with people, not computers.": "Shelley",
  "I don't think 'Sugar Man' is a music doc any more than 'The Social Network' is about computers. It just happens to have the best soundtrack ever.": "Malik",
  "People don't understand computers. Computers are magical boxes that do things. People believe what computers tell them.": "Bruce",
  "When I was in Japan on tour in 2010, I felt like I was 30 years into the future. I love technology and they are so advanced with their phones, computers, everything. I think they had the iPhone way before we did in the U.S. I love gadgets, games, social media and I try to stay ahead on all that stuff, but they get it all first.": "Soulja",
  "We want the digital world to bend to your physical life, your real emotional life as a person, and we don't want you to bend to computers.": "Rony",
  "Yet in this global economy, no jobs are safe. High-speed Internet connections and low-cost, skilled labor overseas are an explosive combination.": "Bob",
  "Google has placed its faith in data, while Apple worships the power of design. This dichotomy made the two companies complementary. Apple would ship the phones and computers, while Google would provide Maps, Search, YouTube, and other web tools that made the devices more useful.": "Ben",
  "We've seen computers play chess and beat grand masters. We've seen computers drive a car across a desert. But interestingly, playing chess is easy, but having a conversation about nothing is really difficult for a computer.": "Hod",
  "Well, my wife always says to me, and I think it's true, it's very difficult for us to understand the Elizabethan understanding and enjoyment and perception of form as it is to say... it would be for them to understand computers or going to the moon or something.": "Mark",
  "Before computers, you'd start designing using shapes of cubes. Now I can start with something like a handkerchief, an object that doesn't have strong inside and outside boundaries or much closed volume.": "Greg",
  "Everyone was saying computers were going to be the future of art; everyone had to do something in this medium. And it was almost some sort of rebellion that I wanted to do these small, intimate drawings.": "Marcel",
  "So technologies, whether it is a telephone or an iPhone, computers in general or automobiles, television even, all individualize us. We all sit in front of our iPhones and communicating but are we really communicating?": "Henry",
  "The future lies in designing and selling computers that people don't realize are computers at all.": "Adam",
  "Computers rather frighten me, because I never did learn to type, so the whole thing seems extraordinarily complicated to me.": "Charles",
  "The guy who knows about computers is the last person you want to have creating documentation for people who don't understand computers.": "Adam",
  "Diaspora starts about a thousand years from now. Most of human civilisation has moved inside computers; essentially, a major branch of our descendants consists of conscious software.": "Greg",
  "The Web is actually a coming together of three technologies, if you like: the hypertext, the personal computer, and the network. So, the network we had, and the personal computers were there, but people didn't use them, because they didn't know what to use them for, except maybe for a few games.": "Robert",
  "I've been programming computers since elementary school, where they taught us, and I stuck with computer science through high school and college.": "Masi",
  "People are good at figuring out what's attractive, and computers are good at quickly searching and finding. You put them together, and bang!": "Luis",
  "The basic idea of Games With a Purpose is that we are taking a problem that computers cannot yet solve, and we are getting people to solve it for us while they are playing a game.": "Luis",
  "I remember having computers at my parents' house growing up. We had different desktop PCs, but my first laptop was an IBM ThinkPad laptop. It was big, bulky, slow and terrible.": "Scott",
  "I don't like computers. I still like to do my drawings by hand.": "Dieter",
  "Technology ventures can succeed with very little investment, unlike many other industries. A lot of the big Internet players like Google or Yahoo were started by a couple of guys with computers. Microsoft was started in Bill Gates' garage.": "Jonathan",
  "They went back there, looked at all the computers, asked me to come in and tell them what all the computers were for specifically so they knew how to dismantle the network I had been running.": "Sherman",
  "When they were done downloading all the information off each hard drive, they took all the computers, all the literature, and loaded everything into a big white truck and left.": "Sherman",
  "And my real enemy is not to hold the specimen sterile, but it's the lighting. The light is our real enemy. So we have to work with very very poor lighting. But we can increase the light with computers.": "Lennart",
  "That's the new way - with computers, computers, computers. That's the way we can have the cell survive and get some new information in high resolution. We started about five years ago and, today, I think we have reached the target.": "Lennart",
  "Smartphones can relay patients' data to hospital computers in a continuous stream. Doctors can alter treatment regimens remotely, instead of making patients come in for a visit.": "Charles",
  "I closely follow everything about user interface or human-computer interface: technology that makes computers closer to the way the human being actually functions.": "Francois-Henri",
  "The Internet is a powerful way to make lots of money... But we are not going to buy Yahoo!": "Sumner",
  "I'm too old-fashioned to use a computer. I'm too old-fashioned to use a quill.": "Christopher",
  "I am interested in computers and technology, and art, photography, and design.": "William",
  "I'm going to get myself one of those, um, movable computers - what do you call them... ? Laptops! I am bad. I still call my radio a wireless.": "Katherine",
  "Future generations will know there's nothing mystical about wetware because by 2100, Moore's law will have given us tiny quantum computers powerful enough to upload a human soul.": "Frank",
  "I'm really interested in the current tech world because of my brother Michael. Since we were little kids, in the 1970s, he was dealing with the first computers. He works for the government.": "Jimmi",
  "I'm looking to evolve the concept of the new renaissance artist, taking the world by storm through the art of public display and demonstration, with technical savvy, using cell phones and computers.": "Perry",
  "Learning can take place in the backyard if there is a human being there who cares about the child. Before learning computers, children should learn to read first. They should sit around the dinner table and hear what their parents have to say and think.": "Dixie",
  "Doing a movie about computers between 1978 and 1982? You can't get much less sexy, less active than that.": "Joshua",
  "I have a cell phone that doesn't behave like a phone: It behaves like a computer that makes calls. Computers are becoming an integral part of daily life. And if people don't start designing them to be more user-friendly, then an even larger part of the population is going to be left out of even more stuff.": "Alan",
  "Computers in classrooms are the filmstrips of the 1990s.": "Clifford",
  "I watch virtually no TV. All my screen time is computer time for me. When I'm not doing that I'm reading or talking to my friends who I got to know through computers.": "Patrick",
  "When I was a kid, I really liked playing chess, which is pretty geeky; I just enjoyed it - thinking, exercising my mind. And I found computers to be like an eight-hour day chess game.": "Michael",
  "I don't understand computers. I've been unable to construct a working mental model of how they do what they do. I can break software by looking at it. I can blow anything up. Without trying. It's sort of like being a dowser. And this extreme elaborate clumsiness on my part is actually something people will pay me for. It's quite wonderful.": "Brenda",
  "I joined the staff of EMI in Middlesex in 1951, where I worked for a while on radar and guided weapons and later ran a small design laboratory. During this time, I became particularly interested in computers, which were then in their infancy. It was interesting, pioneering work at that time: drums and tape decks had to be designed from scratch.": "Godfrey",
  "Imagine if every Thursday your shoes exploded if you tied them the usual way. This happens to us all the time with computers, and nobody thinks of complaining.": "Jef",
  "Right now, computers, which are supposed to be our servant, are oppressing us.": "Jef",
  "There were no PCs when I started programming on computers.": "Dave",
  "Maths is fundamentally a different process in education than it is in the real world. There is an insistence that we do maths by hand when most of it is done by computers. The idea that you have to do everything by hand before you can operate a computer is nonsense.": "Conrad",
  "I use computers for email, staying current with my own website as well as finding important information through other websites. I also use it for creating MP3 files of new music I'm working on.": "Clint",
  "I started getting into Internet technologies and computers. I wasn't especially interested in being a musician, but I wound up finding my way back to being interested in music through computers.": "Eric",
  "I think I was lucky to come of age in a place and time - the American South in the 1960s and '70s - when the machine hadn't completely taken over life. The natural world was still the world, and machines - TV, telephone, cars - were still more or less ancillary, and computers were unheard of in everyday life.": "Ben",
  "Computers do the calculating to allow people to transform the world.": "Conrad",
  "Calculating does not equal mathematics. It's a subsection of it. In years gone by it was the limiting factor, but computers now allow you to make the whole of mathematics more intellectual.": "Conrad",
  "You can't have thousands of cars without good computers on the electric grid.": "Shai",
  "As computers have become more powerful, computer graphics have advanced to the point where it's possible to create photo-realistic images. The bottleneck wasn't, 'How do we make pixels prettier?' It was, 'How do we engage with them more?'": "Jefferson",
  "I took this 'how to build computers' course basically because I'm sick and tired of getting ripped off by cheesy computer companies. Software baffles me. I like hardware. I used to change my own oil, and now I want to build my own computer so I can have what I want.": "Pat",
  "Instead of the cashier and ticket-ripper of the movie theater, the block chain consists of thousands of computers that can process digital tickets, money, and many other fiduciary objects in digital form. Think of thousands of robots wearing green eye shades, all checking each other's accounting.": "Nick",
  "What do we want our kids to do? Sweep up around Japanese computers?": "Walter",
  "I got interested in computers and how they could be enslaved to the megalomaniac impulses of a teenager.": "Eugene",
  "You can't trust the internet.": "Nicollette",
  "Google is about information and computers and making things really fast. Facebook is about the sharing and connections. These missions give these companies direction and motivation.": "Paul",
  "I was playing in bands and doing gigs from the age of 14 on. I stopped at the age of 28. Technology replaced me. As soon as I saw what computers can do, I didn't think there would be a point for a live drummer.": "Mitchell",
  "Starting early and getting girls on computers, tinkering and playing with technology, games and new tools, is extremely important for bridging the gender divide that exists now in computer science and in technology.": "Beth",
  "People's computers are not getting more secure. They're getting more infected with viruses. They're getting more under the control of malware.": "Avi",
  "Computers are very powerful tools, but in the simulated world of the computer, everything has to be calculated.": "Margaret",
  "My dad could be beyond brilliant but totally introverted. If we're talking about computers, he's on. Otherwise, he's a total recluse - he stays in the house and won't leave, and I'm like that. If I'm not working, I'm locked up in my room.": "Alessandra",
  "Music is composed on computers and other electronic equipment producers don't want to spend money on orchestra. ": "Sivamani",
  "I think of myself as a Hollywood hillbilly, but I'm sick of all these questions people ask about Alabama. 'Do you have an outhouse?' 'Is there a lot of inbreeding in your family?' They think all Southerners don't have computers and TV sets and that we're all still living in 1862.": "Sunny",
  "What I try to do is factor in how people use computers, what people's problems are, and how these technologies can get applied to those problems. Then I try to direct the various product groups to act on this information.": "John",
  "Why is it that I notice so many brilliant scientists using Macs for their personal computers why does the Lawrence Livermore & Berkeley Labs buy millions of dollars worth of Macs? ": "Lene",
  "So the thing I realized rather gradually - I must say starting about 20 years ago now that we know about computers and things - there's a possibility of a more general basis for rules to describe nature.": "Stephen",
  "When the first computers started to come in, we tried to digitalize the seismological equipment.": "Frank",
  "I took computers in high school. I would do all my own programming, but I didn't see the future of computers for anything other than data processing. Who was going to use a computer for communications?": "Craig",
  "I do a lot of work on computers, but I am so practiced in drawing that I can draw it full size, and you can take the measurements off my drawings. It's like drafting, but it's a work of art - a really beautiful drawing.": "Charles",
  "I just bought a Mac to help me design the next Cray.": "Seymour",
  "We demand privacy, yet we glorify those that break into computers.": "Bill",
  "Fungible goods in economics can be extended and traded. So, half as much grain is half as much useful, but half a baby or half a computer is less useful than a whole baby or a whole computer, and we've been trying to make computers that work that way.": "Neil",
  "Obviously, our children, who have been playing with their computers since the age of five or six, don't have quite the same brain as those who were brought up on wooden or metal toys, whose brains are certainly atrophied by comparison.": "Claude",
  "There has never been an unexpectedly short debugging period in the history of computers.": "Steven",
  "I've always been slightly embittered about computers because it was the only subject I failed at school.": "Matt",
  "The computer is not, in our opinion, a good model of the mind, but it is as the trumpet is to the orchestra - you really need it. And so, we have very massive simulations in computers because the problem is, of course, very complex.": "Gerald",
  "As a rule, software systems do not work well until they have been used, and have failed repeatedly, in real applications.": "Dave",

  "I think that 'Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance' was mentally taxing, if only because I had to go to a Christmas party shortly after I had wrapped photography in Romania at two in the morning as the Ghost Rider. The invitation had a Christmas ornament on it with Ghost Rider's face on it as a tree.": "Nicolas",
  "Back when we was in school in Mississippi, we had Little Black Sambo.

  "What I'm not saying is that all government spending is bad. It's not - far, far from it, but there is no free lunch, as a former colleague of mine used to say. There is no public tooth fairy. Father Christmas does not work on the Treasury staff this year. You can never bail someone out of trouble without putting someone else into trouble.": "Arthur",

  "On the morning, Daddy and I get up at six o'clock because Christmas trees must be bought in the dark. We walk to the other end of town, as the big harbour is just the right setting for buying a Christmas tree. We spend hours choosing, looking at every branch suspiciously. It's always cold.": "Tove",
  "At school, I'd be the dude singing to the girls, always up in the auditorium, in the lunch room singing Christmas carols, in the halls between class. I was always singing, and same thing with my grandfather. The apple doesn't fall too far from the tree; you know how that goes.": "Desiigner",
  "Sometimes I wonder: What are the children thinking? And sometimes I wonder why the hell I'm not buying a tree like the other neighbors.

  "I've got more than 600 pairs of Ray-Ban sunglasses, from 1950s originals to newer models. I have them on the wall like opticians do so I can pick out a pair that goes with my outfit. I had around 30 pairs, then my husband Rainer started getting them for me as birthday and Christmas gifts.": "Suzi",
  "When I cook for my family on Christmas, I make feijoada, a South American dish of roasted and smoked meats like ham, pork, beef, lamb, and bacon - all served with black beans and rice. It's festive but different.": "Maya",
  "I just think that it's strong and it's important that we recognize what the Christmas season is about; it's about the birth of our Savior, and there's a lot of pressure today to be politically correct, but people are realizing, too, that you have to be open to express your faith what you want believe.": "Joel",
  "For those, like me, who can't rely on being given a home smoker this Christmas, you can build your own approximation with just a roll of tin foil and a big wok or pan for which you have a lid.": "Yotam",
  "I worked for a big department store, and strangely, on my first day, they put me in charge of Christmas wrapping. I didn't know how to wrap a present and make it not look like it fell off a truck.": "Joel",
  "A Christian's celebration of Christmas should be a lot different from that of nonbelievers.": "Monica",
  "Miramax seems to be showing the same faith in Roberto Benigni's 'Pinocchio' that the Republican Party showed in Trent Lott the live-action version of Carlo Collodi's fairy tale about the wooden puppet whose only ambition was to be a real live boy was sneaked into theaters Christmas Day. ": "Elvis",
  "Pfft, I hate Christmas Day. It's for children and families. Not for people like me.": "Karl",
  "I'm a physicist, and we have something called Moore's Law, which says computer power doubles every 18 months. So every Christmas, we more or less assume that our toys and appliances are more or less twice as powerful as the previous Christmas.": "Michio",
  "When I was a child in England before the war, Christmas pudding always contained at least one shiny new sixpence, and it was considered a sign of great good luck for the new year to find one in your helping of the pudding.": "Michael",
  "I grew up believing in Santa Claus, and we still treat our house at Christmas with a huge reverence for that belief - even though our children are 19 through 23.": "Mary",
  "Christmas is a rare occasion when we are reminded that we have obligations to people we did not choose to be related to, and that love is not just a spontaneous feeling but something we sometimes really have to work at, with people we may not even much like.": "Julian",
  "Back in the 1950s and '60s, J. M. Barrie's 'Peter Pan' - starring Mary Martin and Cyril Ritchard - was regularly aired on network television during the Christmas season. I must have seen it four or five times and remember, in particular, Ritchard's gloriously camp interpretation of Captain Hook.": "Michael",
  "I was talking to one of my aunties at Christmas and she said she didn't think it was ever in my nature to go against the grain, that I was always a good boy. I think she was right - I did always want to be good.": "James",
  "My mother was a professional sick person she took a lot of pain pills. There are many people like that. It's just how they are used to getting attention. I always remember she's the daughter of alcoholics who'd leave her alone at Christmas time. ": "Jim",
  "I wanted an electric train for Christmas but I got the saxophone instead.": "Clarence",
  "We used to indulge hopelessly as a family at Christmas. When the children were little, I dressed up as Father Christmas. They knew it was a gag, but they loved it. I remember stealing into their bedrooms at 1 A.M. and filling the stockings up at the end of the bed.": "Richard",
  "Christmas to a child is the first terrible proof that to travel hopefully is better than to arrive.": "Stephen",
  "I think 'Elf' is funny, with Will Ferrell. That's a great Christmas movie.": "Robert",
  "Throughout history, Hanukkah was a relatively minor festival, but it's become very popular in America due to its proximity to Christmas.": "Gil",
  "If you want me to sing this Christmas song with the feeling and the meaning, you better see if you can locate that check.": "Mahalia",
  "I have a musical called Goodbye and Good Luck, based on a Grace Paley short story. I also have King Island Christmas, and there are 20 different productions of it this year.": "David",
  "There's a little vanity chair that Charlie gave me the first Christmas we knew each other. I'll not be parting with that, nor our bed - the four-poster - I'll be needing that to die in.": "Helen",
  "Don't give me books for Christmas I already have a book. ": "Jean",
  "Our family's special holiday tradition is going over to my grandparent's house on Christmas morning. My grandma cooks a big breakfast, and I love hearing her tell old funny stories.": "Caroline",
  "Christmas really is about all the cliches: health, happiness and love. A future with my family is the important thing... to stay alive for them.": "Sylvie",
  "I love the smell of a real Christmas tree - also, my mum's Christmas pudding with brandy sauce.": "Mallory",
  "At Christmas, I am always struck by how the spirit of togetherness lies also at the heart of the Christmas story. A young mother and a dutiful father with their baby were joined by poor shepherds and visitors from afar. They came with their gifts to worship the Christ child.": "Queen",
  "I know that a Christmas tree farm in Pennsylvania is about the most random place for a country singer to come from, but I had an awesome childhood.": "Taylor",
  "Country ham is baked whole, usually with a glaze, sometimes studded with cloves, and served as the centerpiece of Christmas and Easter feasts.": "Kate",
  "The term 'natural resources' confuses people. 'Natural resources' are not like a finite number of gifts under the Christmas tree. Nature is given, but resources are created.": "Alex",
  "Yeah, I started when I was 6 years old. My brother and sister would get all of these presents at Christmas time from the cast and crew of their show and I was jealous. So I decided that I had to become an actor.": "Sara",
  "Christmas, children, is not a date. It is a state of mind.": "Mary",
  "My mother was a not-too-devoted atheist. She went to Episcopal church on Christmas Eve every year, and that was mostly it.": "Anne",
  "I loved rock and roll when that came in, Bill Haley, Little Richard, Fats Domino, Buddy Holly, Elvis Presley, all those great records. So I begged my mom and dad for a guitar, which eventually they did get me for Christmas, but it went out of tune very quickly, and it hurt my fingers.": "Ian",
  "There's nothing sadder in this world than to awake Christmas morning and not be a child.": "Erma",
  "I like to think I'm like the guy who goes to the office Christmas party Friday night, insults some people, but still has his job Monday morning.": "Don",
  "I was nine or 10 years old and my father was sacked on Christmas Day. He was a manager, the results had not been good, he lost a game on December 22 or 23. On Christmas Day, the telephone rang and he was sacked in the middle of our lunch.": "Jose",
  "Christmas is, of course, the time to be home - in heart as well as body.": "Garry",
  "Christmas cookies can't help but be retro - they are memory first, sugar-flour-egg-redhot-gumdrop-sparkle reality second.": "Dana",
  "The Christian faith can never be separated from the soil of sacred events, from the choice made by God, who wanted to speak to us, to become man, to die and rise again, in a particular place and at a particular time.": "Pope",
  "I always liked it when people go back in time to discover things about themselves, like with 'A Christmas Carol' and you're getting a tour of your life by the ghosts of Christmas past, present and future.": "John",
  "Halloween is bigger than Christmas in America. I've experienced it in New York, Los Angeles and Washington D.C., and if you're in the right neighbourhood, every house is decorated with spooky ghosts, spider webs, and jack-o-lanterns.": "Rhys",
  "When we were children we were grateful to those who filled our stockings at Christmas time. Why are we not grateful to God for filling our stockings with legs?": "Gilbert",
  "Time always seems long to the child who is waiting - for Christmas, for next summer, for becoming a grownup: long also when he surrenders his whole soul to each moment of a happy day.": "Dag",
  "My mom is a really good cook. I didn't get the cooking gene, but she cooks this really amazing dinner every Christmas, and that's always really fun.": "Miranda",
  "Working on 'Nightmare Before Christmas,' I had endless arguments, like the studio saying, 'You can't have a main character that's got no eyeballs!' 'How is anybody going to feel for somebody with just eyesockets?' You know? So, it's those kind of things that really wear you down.": "Tim",
  "Leftists wage the war on Christmas using their traditional methods - government fiat and the court system. They never win voting, and they certainly don't win in the free market, so they bravely fight their battles through big government.": "Milo",
  "I love Christmas tree bulbs, and I started putting them in my paintings. You've got to plug this painting in, and it's got a rig in the back, so that each one can be replaced if it burns out.": "David",
  "We consider Christmas as the encounter, the great encounter, the historical encounter, the decisive encounter, between God and mankind. He who has faith knows this truly; let him rejoice.": "Pope",
  "The two most joyous times of the year are Christmas morning and the end of school.": "Alice",
  "Expectancy is the atmosphere for miracles.": "Edwin",
  "God seeks to influence humanity. This is at the heart of the Christmas story. It is the story of light coming into the darkness, of a Savior to show us the way, of light overcoming the darkness, of God's work to save the world.": "Adam",
  "The fact is, we need markers in life, whether we subscribe to a religion or not. And the major holidays, such as Christmas, serve to remind us of the turning world.": "Jay",
  "My mother-in-law has come round to our house at Christmas seven years running. This year we're having a change. We're going to let her in.": "Les",
  "We're raising our girls to understand the real meaning of Christmas, and to know that it's most important to have Christmas in your heart. We go to our local mall and donate toys, and we say prayers for all the people in the world who might not be as lucky as we are.": "Faith",
  "We got to the moon on Christmas Eve 1968, at the end of a poor year for this country. We had Vietnam. We had civil unrest. We had the assassinations of Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King. But we went around the moon and saw the far side for the first time. A script writer couldn't have done a better job of raising people's hope.": "Jim",
  "In the minds of a Liberal, someone who isn't Christian might be offended if we say Merry Christmas to them, so we shouldn't say Merry Christmas to anyone. The logic is bizarre!": "Milo",
  "My little brother and grandma told me I could sing. I used to sing in church, too. Not like in the choir or anything, but for people around the church... on the church bus going home and Christmas plays.": "Bryson",
  "No matter what else is going on, Christmas is my all-time favorite period in the year. It has a positive effect on me like very little else does, seasonally, that is.": "Rush",
  "My parents got me a sewing machine for Christmas during my senior year of high school. I made three pieces of clothing and had a fashion show at the end of the year, where we had to wear the clothes that we made. I took it to a whole new level; I made all my friends clothes.": "Kourtney",
  "Christmas gives us the opportunity to pause and reflect on the important things around us - a time when we can look back on the year that has passed and prepare for the year ahead.": "David",
  "Christmas is, for those who wish to follow the way of Jesus, an invitation to accept into our comfortable and safe lives those who come to us from far away, who seem ragged, marginal, in transition.": "Jay",
  "I love 'White Christmas.' That's one of my favorites just because I love the music. I love the story, Bing Crosby. It's just one of my all time favorites. And it's hard to have a Christmas without seeing a little bit of Jimmy Stewart and angels running around town.": "Scott",
  "My family background is Mexican, and I was born in Chicago. It's pretty much family tradition every time we get together for Christmas and major holidays to sing. Our family time is centered around the food and a little bit of performing for one another.": "Ailyn",
  "I didn't know the full dimensions of forever, but I knew it was longer than waiting for Christmas to come.": "Richard",
  "Every July, I look forward to taping a Christmas show - in July in Nashville. In 98-degree weather. I love it.": "Larry",
  "Christmas is a Christian holiday, and any self-respecting person of another religion should not celebrate a holiday that they don't believe in. Clearly, Christ is in the name of the holiday, so there should be a belief in Him.": "Monica",
  "Giving is a really big thing around Christmas, as well it should be. Christmas is about giving, and it all stems from the greatest gift the world has ever received - the gift of Jesus Christ.": "Monica",
  "For me, the two weeks between Christmas and Twelfth Night have come to be reserved for desultory reading. The pressure of the holiday is over, the weather outside is frightful, there are lots of leftovers to munch on, vacation hours are being used up.": "Michael",
  "That's the true spirit of Christmas people being helped by people other than me. ": "Jerry",
  "The thing about Christmas is that it almost doesn't matter what mood you're in or what kind of a year you've had - it's a fresh start.": "Kelly",
  "I save every Christmas card. I keep them all.": "Alison",
  "Next to a circus there ain't nothing that packs up and tears out faster than the Christmas spirit.": "Kin",
  "Christmas is the antithesis of Thanksgiving. Christmas is pretty much a man-made holiday.": "John",
  "According to an ancient Sardinian legend, the bodies of those who are born on Christmas Eve will never dissolve into dust but are preserved until the end of time.": "Grazia",
  "It is never too late to get into tennis! While I started playing at the age of 8 when my parents gave me a tennis racquet for Christmas, tennis is a lifelong sport that can be enjoyed by people of almost any age. It's also something you never forget once you learn.": "Samantha",
  "When you have kids, you instantly feel that you do not want to do them wrong. Those dads that go off to Florida and start a new life, I couldn't imagine that: seeing my kid once every Christmas, every three years. If I'm gone for six days it feels like too much.": "Adam",
  "For me growing up, Christmas time was always the most fantastic, exciting time of year, and you'd stay up until three in the morning. You'd hear the parents wrapping in the other room but you knew that also, maybe, they were in collusion with Santa Claus.": "Chris",
  "I've got some incredible fans actually - so loyal and they make me birthday cards and Christmas cards. I got this package of poems and artwork based around the songs. They've got this thing called 'Floetry' where they all have to put in artwork. They've set up their own competitions and stuff which is kind of amazing.": "Florence",
  "Globalization has created this interlocking fragility. At no time in the history of the universe has the cancellation of a Christmas order in New York meant layoffs in China.": "Nassim",
  "I still get up every morning at 4 A.M. I write seven days a week, including Christmas. And I still face a blank page every morning, and my characters don't really care how many books I've sold.": "Dan",
  "I'm a strong nonbeliever in the Christmas letter where you don't really read it because it's just full of kind of meaningless information. It doesn't really resonate to the person reading it, but it means so much to the person that wrote it.": "B.",
  "I throw a Christmas party at my house. It's not really a Christmas party, because I don't want to call it a Christmas party. But let's just say I put a lot of Christmas trees around the house, so it smells good.": "Bill",
  "It kills me when people talk about California hedonism. Anybody who talks about California hedonism has never spent a Christmas in Sacramento.": "Joan",
  "The holidays are my favorite time of year! Christmas was always one of the biggest celebrations in Sweden, and I look forward to the festivities each year.": "Marcus",
  "You are not practicing Judaism if you celebrate Christmas.": "Elliott",
  "I used to sleep in the T-shirt I wore during the day and whatever ratty old gym shorts I could find on the floor. But one year for Christmas, someone gave me a very chic, comfortable pair of pajamas from Brooks Brothers, and I realized the error of my ways.": "Derek",
  "If you had a Ministry box set under your Christmas tree, wrapped in paper, 'From Beer to Eternity' is the bow that goes around the present, you know what I mean?": "Al",
  "Once I found out that I was playing 'Deathlok,' I unearthed my old comic book collection. I was going home for Christmas, and I have a collection of thousands of comics. I was surprised to see that 90% of them were Marvel. So, I wanted to go through my collection and start there.": "J.",
  "My father Bill had a problem with Christmas. Although he appears in old photographs to possess a whippy, muscular frame, he was actually a frail man and usually managed to cause some kind of drama just before the festivities began.": "Christopher",
  "I don't have a real recipe with measurements for my chicken stew. I just kind of make it up as I go. I made it for the first time one Christmas when I came home from college. It's guaranteed to cure a cold.": "John",
  "Seeing the actual 'The Chronicles of Narnia: The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe', I absolutely loved it. It became one of my favourite films. It was a real Christmas classic, and it was one of the most popular films ever in British history.": "Will",
  "I tend to think of Pluto and its moons as presents sitting under a Christmas tree. They're wrapped, and from Earth all we can do is look at the boxes to see whether they're light or heavy, to see if something maybe jiggles a bit inside. We're seeing intriguing things, but we really don't know what's in there.": "Alan",
  "At the heart of every really good Christmas movie is the threat, I suppose, to Christmas. Something is wrong with Christmas, in all of these movies. In 'The Polar Express,' there's a kid that doesn't really believe, and that's the threat to Christmas. In 'Santa Claus: The Movie,' jealousy and greed are threatening to overrun his Christmas.": "James",
  "I love snow; I love building snowman. The only thing I don't like is the cold - so if we could have a hot Christmas, that would be amazing.": "Ella",
  "Growing up in Northern California, I've only seen snow at Christmas maybe twice in my life! I was always jealous of my cousins on the East Coast with their white Christmases.": "Guy",
  "I think we've taken the meaning of Christmas out. People don't stop and think about Jesus or the birth of Jesus. When they think of Christmas, they think of Santa Claus and - for the children, and they think of giving gifts and out-giving the next person of spending their time looking for the right thing for somebody who has everything.": "Billy",
  "When you give up yourself, that's when you will feel the true spirit of Christmas. And that's giving that's serving others and that's when you feel fulfilled.": "Joel",
  "I started wearing Ugg when I was, like, 13 or 14, in high school, and my mom got me a pair for Christmas one year.": "Tom",
  "It's funny, I was talking to somebody who writes for a cop show, and he was saying how they aren't allowed to acknowledge Christmas, Thanksgiving, Valentine's Day, just because it has to be able to play forever.": "Hannah",
  "As a very young man growing up in Texas, usually I got a shotgun or cowboy boots for Christmas.": "Robert",
  "Christmas can have a real melancholy aspect, 'cause it packages itself as this idea of perfect family cohesion and love, and you're always going to come up short when you measure your personal life against the idealized personal lives that are constantly thrust in our faces, primarily by TV commercials.": "Dan",
  "My fondest memories are generally the day after Thanksgiving. I get the total decorating Christmas itch.": "Katharine",
  "I'd rather do community service than sit and write a load of Christmas cards.": "Paul",
  "When I met Letterman, he told me he thought 'Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)' was the greatest Christmas song he ever heard, and he wanted me to be on his show to sing it.": "Darlene",
  "Every Christmas, all around Ghana, there are tons of these parties and they are full of everything that exists in human life in Ghana and worldwide.": "Taiye",
  "I cut 'Diamond in My Crown' in my home in Georgia, because I wanted to use an old 1848 pump organ that my mother-in-law had gotten for Emory for Christmas one year. His mother would be proud to know that pump organ was made use of.": "Patty",
  "It's bad enough being conned into singing an anti-war message by John Lennon when you think you're just wishing everyone a merry Christmas.": "Ian",
  "I have to confess that I've never been a great fan of Christmas or, as it's known in our house, The Monster That Ate the Last Third of the Year. It's mostly the rampant consumerism I object to, but I'm also a little wary of the annual crop of new Christmas stories and sometimes wonder why anyone bothers.": "Tony",
  "I might do 'X Factor' next year. It's looking good that I won't get the sack at Christmas.": "Gary",
  "No sane local official who has hung up an empty stocking over the municipal fireplace, is going to shoot Santa Claus just before a hard Christmas.": "Al",
  "Very early on in life, I decided the hell with it: material things weren't for me. Christmas would come, and other kids would have all these presents, and it wouldn't bother me a bit.": "James",
  "Christmas coming means one thing for comedians: office party gigs!": "Katherine",
  "I am a veteran of the War on Christmas. I am just emerging from a battlefield strewn with dead trees and torn shreds of brightly colored wrapping paper.": "Henry",
  "I like the idea of putting your Christmas wish list up and letting people share it.": "Bill",
  "Don't send funny greeting cards on birthdays or at Christmas. Save them for funerals, when their cheery effect is needed.": "P.",
  "I detest 'Jingle Bells,' 'White Christmas,' 'Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,' and the obscene spending bonanza that nowadays seems to occupy not just December, but November and much of October, too.": "Richard",
  "I suppose if you look back to your early childhood you accept everything people tell you, and that includes a heavy dose of irrationality - you're told about tooth fairies and Father Christmas and things.": "Richard",
  "Christmas makes everything twice as sad.": "Douglas",
  "Christmas means a great deal to me. I was reared in a family that celebrated Christmas to some extent, but I married into a family that celebrated Christmas in a big way. And my wife always made a big thing of Christmas for the children. We have five children, and we had a terrific time at Christmas.": "Billy",
  "For Christmas every year, my mother used to give me those cheap little diaries that would tell your horoscope and provide a little blank slot for each day.": "Patti",
  "Tiny quails may not seem as impressive as a mammoth turkey, but there is something refreshing about a spread of individual birds on the Christmas table.": "Yotam",
  "It's surprising to me how many of my friends send Christmas cards, or holiday cards, including my atheist and secular friends.": "Christopher",
  "My early business ventures included growing Christmas trees and breeding birds.": "Richard",
  "I've always loved Christmas and that's not really gone away from me from being a child to now. It's always a magical time and I'm unashamed in my love for Christmas.": "Martin",
  "Godot is whatever it is in life that you are waiting for: 'I'm waiting to win the lottery. I'm waiting to fall in love'. For me, as a child, it was Christmas. At least that eventually came.": "Ian",
  "When I was a child, I was living in the housing projects of Philadelphia. I didn't even have a Christmas tree.": "Bill",
  "Having a birthday cake squashed into your face by young kids? Delicious. I always don a Santa suit at Christmas. Remaining childish is a tremendous state of innocence.": "John",
  "Even today, I am still very child-like while designing. It's a bit like Christmas - each of your designs you create is like unravelling your presents.": "Christian",
  "Christmas for me is all about spending time with my family. I cherish any chance we have to spend all day together making gingerbread houses, baking cookies, or sitting around and watching movies.": "Blake",
  "The Swedish Christmas is definitely unique, even throughout Scandinavia. Like Christmas everywhere, it's a very family-centered holiday.": "Marcus",
  "I love singing Christmas carols. I know every harmony to every music-hall Christmas song.": "Zooey",
  "One thing I love about Christmas music is that it has a tradition of warmth.": "Zooey",
  "I remember driving to North Carolina when I was a little girl in a snowstorm to get down to my mom's family in the Carolinas. There were chains on the car - it was the late sixties - and we were just singing in the car. Christmas carols.": "Tori",
  "Fashion Week is like Christmas.": "Brad",
  "If you do good work, it tends to stick around. People still come up to me and say, 'The Ref' is my favorite Christmas movie.'": "Denis",
  "The Christmas market at the Barcelona Cathedral sells all kinds of things for your Nativity scene. It will also give you a good idea of Catalan culture.": "Jose",
  "There is a lot to celebrate about that little Babe who was laid in a manger. Christians celebrate Christmas because they are thankful for the promise of salvation, which was delivered in human flesh and named Jesus.": "Monica",
  "The word of God is very important to Christmas. For unto us a child was born, and we should be reminded of how Christ's amazing journey came to be.": "Monica",
  "It's funny how we 'do' Christmas. Christmas is not something that we do, it is something that was done. It celebrates the long awaited arrival of the Messiah, Jesus Christ. We had nothing to do with it, but what we can do is praise God for the coming of the Lord, who washed away the sins of the world by dying on the cross.": "Monica",
  "During the holiday season, Christmas specifically, it can be hard to be away from family and friends.": "Monica",
  "I'm not going to tell you to meditate on what Christmas really means and be thankful.": "Monica",
  "In my adolescence, I think I felt very outcast; I felt lonely. I felt great loneliness, and sometimes I wouldn't partake in Christmas, and I would go off and wander in the streets of Melbourne.": "Michael",
  "I used to have nightmares when I was a little kid that I woke up prematurely and opened all the Christmas presents. And then I would be so relieved when I woke up and I realized that I hadn't done it.": "Claire",
  "My family know not to get me any tech for Christmas. I can never get it to work, and it all becomes very tearful and pressurised.": "Peter",
  "We don't consider the Wizard of Oz or Father Christmas to be too old. They're still magical characters, and the fact they've been around the block only adds to their magic.": "Peter",
  "On Christmas morning, before we could open our Christmas presents, we would go to this stranger's home and bring them presents. I remember helping clean the house up and putting up a tree. My father believed that you have a responsibility to look after everyone else.": "George",
  "Tax cuts should be for life, not just for Christmas.": "George",
  "I got a .30-30 for Christmas in the seventh grade. It wasn't what I asked for, by the way.": "Matt",
  "I think that there are a lot of really beautiful Christmas carols, and then sometimes there are horrible renditions of them that are played to death in malls that make me sad. I try to avoid stores where they're playing bad versions of Christmas songs on repeat.": "Gillian",
  "There are those who argue that the public celebration of festivals such as Christmas should be discouraged, in the questionable belief that it might somehow offend those of other religions or none.": "Pope",
  "My first real job, I sold Christmas trees when I was twelve for extra money. I did that until I was fifteen. Then I bagged groceries, and I worked at the first Borders ever in Tulsa, Oklahoma.": "Bill",
  "Making a Christmas album is looked upon by some people as the thing you do when you are heading towards retirement.": "Annie",
  "I gave a Christmas party last year - well, two Christmases ago - where I did a Sam Cooke show. I didn't perform as R. Kelly. I performed the Sam Cooke show from 1964, when he performed at the Copacabana.": "R.",
  "Almost any American can connect on some level to a family background of having come across some ocean. They say, 'My great-grandparents came from wherever... this is why we have this last name, why we do this thing at Christmas.' All the details get watered down but don't quite disappear.": "Jhumpa",
  "Christopher Walken and Nathalie Baye played my parents so well that I really thought I was in my living room at Christmas. My mother couldn't have been played more correctly.": "Frank",
  "December used to be very difficult for me. For many years, I fought the transition to the new year, was generally exhausted at the end of the year, and just wanted to hide. I described myself as a 'cranky Jewish kid who felt left out by Christmas.'": "Brad",
  "Online, there's no time. It's always Christmas.": "Lewis",
  "Christmas time! That man must be a misanthrope indeed, in whose breast something like a jovial feeling is not roused - in whose mind some pleasant associations are not awakened - by the recurrence of Christmas.": "Charles",
  "You can't allow the forces of political correction to shut you up. I mean, why are people afraid to say, 'Merry Christmas?' Give me a break. If people don't like it, yeah, they can go do something else.": "Ben",
  "In London the day after Christmas (Boxing Day), it began to snow: my first snow in England. For five years, I had been tactfully asking, 'Do you ever have snow at all?' as I steeled myself to the six months of wet, tepid gray that make up an English winter. 'Ooo, I do remember snow,' was the usual reply, 'when I were a lad.'": "Sylvia",
  "It's fun when you start a movie, because it's kind of like you get to go Christmas shopping... you get to make your wish list and you start thinking about what each character needs.": "Spike",
  "Before Christmas, I host a party for our kids and all their friends. We love to make a mess while decorating gingerbread houses.": "Kourtney",
  "Sometime in the early Seventies, gender-free toys were briefly a popular idea. So at Christmas on the California beach in 1972, we downplayed the dolls with frilly dresses and loaded up Santa's sack with toy trucks and earth movers for our three daughters.": "Tom",
  "I love Christmas. I love the music... I love everything about Christmas. I'm a big fan.": "Darius",
  "When you spend such a large portion of your life working - and it's not fun, and you're worried about getting sued or fired for saying the wrong thing or for acting crazy at a work party - then what has work done to America? That's the impetus to have a huge office Christmas party.": "T.",
  "Actually, my mother and Alfie came for three weeks' Christmas vacation and stayed for 21 years. I guess my mother never went back because she was lonely.": "Frank",
  "We never really had any kind of a Christmas. This is one part where my memory fails me completely.": "Frank",
  "The way my family always did Christmas was on Christmas Eve, it wasn't really centered around a dinner on Christmas Eve. It was more about keeping the kids calm. Sometime after dark is when we were going to open all the presents underneath the tree from Mom, Dad and the kids and everything - just the family presents was every Christmas Eve.": "Blake",
  "Christmas in L.A. is weird. There's no snow. It's not even cold.": "Ellie",
  "Now I'm an old Christmas tree, the roots of which have died. They just come along and while the little needles fall off me replace them with medallions.": "Orson",
  "When I was a kid, we would get McDonalds on Christmas Eve, and that was a big deal because the closest one to the south side of Chicago was a 35 minute drive away. I remember opening the bag and smelling those fries, and even now when I smell them, it reminds me of Christmas Eve.": "Jane",
  "I've been in Chicago for every Christmas of my life.": "Jane",
  "I am Jewish, but I love Christmas, as most Jews with any taste do, because Hanukkah is lame.": "Billy",
  "Amy Poehler and I once ambushed people and made them sing Christmas carols with us.": "Billy",
  "If I'm getting on an airplane or anywhere, really, I have a lunch box and stuff. It's a running joke with my friends and family - everyone gives me lunch boxes for Christmas.": "Nikki",
  "Besides Christianity and specifically Catholicism being wonderful, Christmas is intrinsic to American culture and worth defending. Think of what happens at Christmas time. People play Mariah Carey Christmas songs... What else do you need in life?": "Milo",
  "I am a bit of a mother hen at Christmas! I always prepare in advance. It is the only way; otherwise, it can be really daunting.": "Mary",
  "My son is a tree surgeon and gets me a lovely tree. I like to put it up early, as I can't wait for Christmas. We dress it with decorations that have been in the family for years.": "Mary",
  "I grew up in a reform Jewish family in St. Louis. Our idea of Judaism was no bar mitzvahs and a Christmas tree that had a skirt at the bottom embroidered with the names of my grandparents.": "Danny",
  "We should celebrate Christmas throughout the year, but I believe the whole concept of giving was the basis of Christmas, that it was a charitable, you know, giving, and I think we got carried away with giving.": "Victoria",
  "My mom loved my Christmas music, so I did an awful lot of it!": "Johnny",
  "For me, hearing my voice is sometimes a little nauseating, especially at Christmas.": "Johnny",
  "My mom and dad always tried to make Christmas special for us. We were poor, but it's funny because we had no idea.": "Johnny",
  "I always felt like what I was doing wasn't selling toys; I was making a happy sound at Christmas. When people hear something so familiar, it brings them back to a special place, and that's been meaningful for me.": "Johnny",
  "Christmas is never going to go away, and it's always going to be there. And there's always room for one more Christmas song, I think.": "Johnny",
  "My parents were over the moon when I had some success with Christmas songs because that was the time of the year that meant so much to them. They were able to see their loved ones, and it was great to hear their son's voice on the radio while they visited.": "Johnny",
  "I was once part of a Christmas cabaret. I sang 'I Saw Mommy Kissing Santa Claus.' I tap-danced. I had a ten-gallon hat. It was quite absurd.": "Peter",
  "I do watch 'It's a Wonderful Life' with my children at Christmas, and I liked it long before it went into the public domain and became a cliche.": "Edward",
  "My favorite traditional Christmas movie that I like to watch is All Quiet on the Western Front. It's just not December without that movie in my house.": "Tom",
  "For a long time all I wanted for Christmas were books about outdoor survival. I was convinced that the woods were calling me. I camped a lot, I took classes. At 18, I told myself if I don't live in the woods by myself by the time I'm 25, I have failed.": "Chris",
  "I don't know of too many double Christmas albums, so it is something that's new, and hopefully will be fun, and there's plenty of stuff out there to cut.": "Garth",
  "When I was 11, I made truffle risotto for my family for Christmas dinner.": "Gigi",
  "I'm going to take the kids away over Christmas but I don't, I've written 14 musicals now, I don't want to rush into doing something just for the sake of doing it. I want to do it when I find a story.": "Andrew",
  "I am a Jew, and every single one of my ancestors was Jewish. And it does not bother me even a little bit when people call those beautiful lit up, bejeweled trees Christmas trees. I don't feel threatened. I don't feel discriminated against.": "Ben",
  "It doesn't bother me a bit when people say, 'Merry Christmas' to me. I don't think they are slighting me or getting ready to put me in a ghetto. In fact, I kind of like it.": "Ben",
  "In my experience, those who make the biggest fuss about not spending much at Christmas are generally the ones who buy what they want and eat where they want 12 months a year.": "Julian",
  "There's never really been a real hood Christmas movie.": "Ice",
  "I remember wishing there was snow in L.A. And how jealous we used to get of those Christmas specials with kids playing in the snow.": "Ice",
  "For many years, I've wanted to do one, and I've always mentioned it to the chieftains, and they would say things like, 'Oh well. Christmas albums don't sell,' and things like that. But that's not the point. Christmas albums are important. The music is important. The season is important.": "Aretha",
  "The eight years of war since 9/11 had meant several Christmases away from home for most of these men. For soldiers at war, there's comforting continuity in the traditions and inevitability of Christmas.": "Stanley",
  "Fragrance is a very personal gift, and I think that's why it makes a great Christmas gift. There's a very distinct signature to it, so if you give it as a gift, I like to think that it's from a person that thinks very highly of you.": "Ryan",
  "We only open a couple of presents on Christmas morning we're all about the stockings - we even get them for the dogs! ": "Darcey",
  "I always go to my mom's house for Christmas.": "Brantley",
  "My dad's a firefighter, so I know what it's like for policemen and firefighters to be on their own on Christmas Day.": "J.",
  "I still have the Triumph Palm Beach I was given for Christmas when I was 11. By today's standards, it is heavy and slow, but was my pride and joy at the time.": "Jeremy",
  "My most memorable meal was with my parents at Joel Robuchon's Restaurant Jamin in Paris. It was Christmas 1982, and the flavors - from cauliflower and caviar to crab and tomato - astounded me. It was the first time I remember thinking that I would like to really learn how to cook.": "Alex",
  "I was doing a tour of the 'Batman' live stage production, and I challenged the cast to join me to run. One time, we were running in Switzerland just before Christmas, and it was heavy snow. Another time, we were running down the Seine in Paris on Christmas Day, and we all had Santa hats on.": "Sam",
  "I'm like everybody: I gain the Christmas 10 or so, and then I try to exercise more and dial it back.": "Trisha",
  "We play everybody's Christmas records at our house, and sometimes you think, 'I'm not gonna play my own record; I'd be embarrassed.' But I'm gonna play our record this Christmas, because I love the songs!": "Trisha",
  "Christmas albums are not something you do frequently.": "Isaac",
  "There are very few people who have done more than one Christmas album.": "Isaac",
  "I would literally sit at home and have my friends take pictures of me on my little Canon camera that my mom gave me for Christmas.": "Kendall",
  "My urge at Christmas time or Hanukkah-time or Kwanzaa-time is that people go to bookstores: that they walk around bookstores and look at the shelves. Go to look for authors that they've loved in the past and see what else those authors have written.": "Michael",
  "It's a sad commentary on our time - to use a phrase much favored by my late father - that people increasingly celebrate Christmas Day by going to the movies.": "Michael",
  "Deep in my cortex, the year is divided into reading seasons. The period from mid-October to Christmas, for instance, is 'ghost story' time, while Jane Austen and P. G. Wodehouse pretty much own April and May.": "Michael",
  "Neither my mom nor my dad ever bought me any comic books. Certainly not for Christmas. I suspect that doing so would have violated the Parents' Code.": "Michael",
  "It may be a cliche, but it's true - the build-up to Christmas is so much more pleasurable than the actual day itself.": "Julie",
  "One Christmas build-up tradition, however, has totally bypassed me - that of going up to town and 'doing a show.'": "Julie",
  "Comparing 'Christmas Vacation' to 'It's A Wonderful Life' is the silliest thing. That film starred the greatest movie actor of all time, and the idea that our movie could ever be connected in some fashion to something so brilliant and beautiful always made feel like, 'That's all they had to write about?'": "Chevy",
  "Frank Capra's grandson was a second Assistant Director on 'Christmas Vacation.'": "Chevy",
  "I beg people not to accept the seasonal ritual of well-timed charity on Christmas Eve. It's blasphemy.": "Jonathan",
  "The tradition of putting candles on Christmas trees actually began in Germany. The person who came up with the idea is thought to have been Martin Luther, father of the Reformation.": "Christopher",
  "I love all the gift guides that the magazines put out, whether it's 'InStyle' doing Mother's Day gifts or color guides, or the 'O' magazine Christmas guide.": "Dylan",
  "Most of us remember Nat King Cole as a vocalist. His warm, grainy baritone is still so closely identified with such familiar ballads as 'Stardust' and 'The Christmas Song' that it's hard to imagine anyone else performing them.": "Terry",
  "The whole Christmas story was probably a later addition to the gospel narratives, presented only by the authors of Matthew and Luke. Mark and John seem never to have heard of the manger in Bethlehem, the Massacre of the Innocents, the hovering star, the three wise men, and so forth.": "Jay",
  "Christmas is a story that has both religious and pagan origins, and to ignore its power is to ignore the power of myth - those symbols and legends that help us to ground our lives.": "Jay",
  "Brits and Americans have hundreds of different phrases for the same thing. Luckily, it's usually a source of amusement rather than frustration. A flashlight by any other name is still a torch. My personal favourite is 'fairy lights,' which we boringly refer to as 'Christmas lights.'": "Sloane",
  "Once you start a business, you have to grow it and grow with it - starting a business is not just for Christmas.": "Natalie",
  "I like animals. I like people who like animals. I hate people who love animals to the point they lose their sense of reason. I'm talking the 'my computer wallpaper is my dog,' 'I hang a Christmas stocking for my cat' crowd.": "John",
  "Christmas is a great time to recommit to each other and our communities.": "James",
  "As we see thousands of public and private Christmas trees and nativity displays around the country, they remind us again of the powerful American value built into our Constitution: our freedom of religion.": "James",
  "For the millions of Americans, like my family, who believe that there is a creator God who can be known personally, Christmas is a celebration of Jesus' offer of love and forgiveness for all people.": "James",
  "Spanish Explorers celebrated Christmas in 1539 in the area we now know as the State of Florida.": "James",
  "I am one of those people who is not very patient in the makeup chair. I have been offered movies like 'Planet of the Apes' and stuff like 'The Grinch Who Stole Christmas' and I turned them down.": "John",
  "I quickly discovered that trying to go play golf while living in Manhattan was about as easy as trying to grab a taxi while standing out in front of Saks Fifth Avenue in the freezing rain on the last shopping day before Christmas.": "Dan",
  "I've got my organic veg patch and fruit; we're very garden-obsessed, my husband and I. He designed a garden for me for Christmas, so beautiful! Alasdhair's very good at the proportion and ground work, and I come in and do the planting and the color scheme.": "Stella",
  "When I was six years old, I fell in love with magic. For Christmas, I got a magic box and a very old book on card manipulation. Somehow, I was more interested in pure manipulation than in all the silly little tricks in the box.": "Philippe",
  "Christmas lights may be the loneliest thing for me, especially if you mix them up with reindeers and sleighs. I feel alone. I feel isolated. I feel I do not belong.": "Mira",
  "Lyndon B. Johnson thought he'd have the boys home from Vietnam by Christmas - for four Christmases in a row (he never shifted course, and lost his presidency for it).": "Rick",
  "Things change; your priorities change in life. So I'd never think of riding 100 miles on Christmas Day now, because I've got two kids, and it's selfish.": "Bradley",
  "When I grew up, we always had our chickens, and we ate our eggs, and we ate our chickens. The family always had a pig, and we would kill it at Christmas and eat it for three or four months afterwards.": "Isabella",
  "I don't know if anybody's ever ready for another award season. It's kind of like Christmas.": "James",
  "I love Christmas. I never used to. I didn't hate it, but I could take it or leave it. But, as I got to the age of 25 or 26, Christmas became quite a big deal, and I love it now. I love the food, and I love sharing time with people.": "James",
  "I grew up as a photo nut. Every Christmas I would get a new camera. It's a huge part of my life.": "Kevin",
  "All punk rockers hate Christmas.": "Rhys",
  "In terms of the first Christmas when I met everybody, I went over to Nick's grandfather's house where they were having the big Christmas dinner, and they have this tradition of this thing called oyster stew.": "Megan",
  "Every Christmas, all I ever wanted was Playskool instruments. It was my entire life. And then by the time I was 6 or 7 years old, it became, 'Now I'm going to force my entire family to watch me perform all these rock songs.'": "Andy",
  "Some bands today have the experience of really working together and honing their craft. And other bands are very much like, 'I just got a guitar for Christmas, let's start a band.' And you can hear the difference.": "Robbie",
  "I had always sung in choirs. Even when it was something to be laughed at or made fun of, you know, in school. And I was always the kid who was picked at the Christmas concert to sing the solo, you know, while the other kids snickered in the front few rows.": "Scott",
  "I think it's kind of difficult to write a good Christmas song because you have a narrow framework of references that you have to work within, and at the same time you want to do something that's personally original and hopefully somewhat unique.": "John",
  "The Christmas genre is a field that's been well-ploughed.": "John",
  "The cheese board is my big treat at Christmas that I have to deny myself during the rest of year.": "Johnny",
  "My Christmas present to myself each year is to see how much air travel can open up the world and take me to places as far from sheltered California and Japan as possible.": "Pico",
  "As Michael Scheuer, who ran the C.I.A.'s bin Laden unit until 1999, has pointed out, if bin Laden believed in Christmas, the Iraq war would be his perfect present from Santa Claus. The 9/11 attacks and the subsequent war in Afghanistan severely damaged bin Laden's organization.": "Peter",
  "'The Christmas Song,' by Nat King Cole, is not only a masterful performance; to me it just sounds like the holidays. I've never sung it, because Nat's version is so perfect. I gotta leave it alone.": "Harry",
  "My favorite holiday memory was sitting at home all day in my pajamas during winter break for school watching a bunch of old Christmas movies like 'Jack Frost' and 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer' with my siblings and parents.": "Becky",
  "Atheists well understand that Christmas is the most visible display of religion in the world, and that any diminishment of it is a good thing to militant secularists.": "Bill",
  "I built my church on Easter services, Christmas Eve services, and Norman Vincent Peale.": "Robert",
  "I love giving gifts. It's almost like I don't open my gifts until, like, three days after Christmas 'cause I want to give everyone else their presents.": "Mariah",
  "Christmas is always the most fun. I start looking forward to Christmas before it's even summertime.": "Mariah",
  "The sight of people sleeping on the streets hits us hardest around Christmas and New Year. We see them camped out alone on the freezing concrete, and we think, with a rush of guilt, about heading home to our families and our soft beds.": "John",
  "I've been playing on Christmas for the last 10, 11, 12 years. So just got to get up early with the babies, and give them their toys and try to get a nap in and just come to play.": "Shaquille",
  "My favorite part was when my grandfather and I would make a special trip to Firpo's Bakery for red and green Christmas cookies and fruitcake studded with the sweetest cherries I've ever tasted. Usually Firpo's was too expensive for our slim budget, but Christmas mornings they gave a discount to any children who came in.": "Chitra",
  "As I remember my grandfather and those Christmas mornings he gave for a little girl's pleasure, I know that often a big life starts with doing small things.": "Chitra",
  "We even had a different word for Christmas in my language, Bengali: Baradin, which literally meant 'big day.'": "Chitra",
  "I couldn't live on the singing at first, so I worked as a cleaner, in a launderette, in a garage, face painting and doing the windows of shops at Christmas, 'cause I had been to art college.": "Imelda",
  "I've got a quad copter on my Christmas list, as I suspect quite a few people do.": "Blake",
  "We go to Italy every winter, and my husband's mother has a bingo party on Christmas. Every woman brings a dish: lentils, cavolo nero, tons of beans, polenta, every type of cheese, bruschetta, fresh vegetables, and local olive oil and wine.": "Debi",
  "So we're considering doing a new Christmas album, because there's been Christmas episodes since then, and maybe finally do the version of 'The Most Offensive Song Ever' with lyrics intact.": "Trey",
  "I remember being banned from other houses as a younger child during the winter holiday season; I was the only one who didn't believe in Santa Claus, and I was ruining everyone's Christmas.": "Jami",
  "The real reason Jews don't have more Hanukkah music is that, historically, American Jewish singer-songwriters were too busy making Christmas music. 'White Christmas,' 'Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer,' 'Silver Bells' and 'The Christmas Song (Chestnuts Roasting)' were all written by Jews.": "Matisyahu",
  "Is it possible Hanukkah doesn't inspire folksy songs? Plot lines may be a part. The Christmas story has a lot of material to work with. There's Jesus and his birth, the wise men, their gifts and tons of frankincense.": "Matisyahu",
  "Songs that aren't even remotely connected to Christmas are now officially canonized Christmas tunes. 'Frosty the Snowman,' 'Jingle Bells' and 'Winter Wonderland' never mention anything religious but are still notches in Christmas' belt of musical dominance.": "Matisyahu",
  "The No. 1 best-selling Christmas album of all time is from Kenneth Bruce Gorelick, the Jewish smooth-jazz legend Kenny G. American Jews have always produced a lot of holiday music, just not Hanukkah music.": "Matisyahu",
  "I made a French film called 'Merry Christmas' which is a very European film. It's a World War I piece.": "Diane",
  "It's quite a famous story that takes place on Christmas Eve, and the Germans, French, and Scottish are trying to make peace one night and they bury their dead and they play football. I play a German opera singer, in German, which I never have so I am really excited about that.": "Diane",
  "We no longer sing and dance. We don't know how to. Instead, we watch other people sing and dance on the television screen. Christmas, which was once a festival of active enjoyment, has turned into a binge of purely passive pleasures.": "Tom",
  "In Denmark, the annual Christmas party is probably the most important cultural institution in the country.": "Joshua",
  "My grandmother did all the cooking at Christmas. We ate fattened chicken. We would feed it even more so it would be big and fat.": "Alain",
  "The most classic French dessert around the holidays is the Christmas log, with butter cream. Two flavors. Chocolate and coconut. My first job in the kitchen when I was a boy was to make these Christmas logs.": "Alain",
  "I've always been shy, but I see that as a good thing because it kept me focused on music. When I was in seventh grade, I asked my parents for a mobile recording system for Christmas, and I got it. I didn't come out of my room for years after that. I'd get invited to the movies and I'd say, 'I'm gonna finish a couple of demos.'": "Hunter",
  "When I was in seventh grade, I asked my parents for a mobile recording system for Christmas, and I got it. I didn't come out of my room for years after that. I'd get invited to the movies and I'd say, 'I'm gonna finish a couple of demos.'": "Hunter",
  "Christmas is relentless. It's around the clock. I sit with my little ones in front of the TV screen, and we watch movie after movie after movie.": "Sayed",
  "When I was really young, I loved the movie 'White Christmas' - I still do - and I thought Rosemary Clooney was so pretty. When I was, like, nine, I would tell people, 'You know who I kind of look like? Rosemary Clooney.'": "Tina",
  "My family always makes a huge deal out of Christmas.": "Jenna",
  "I turned the Gloucester Christmas lights on and our local Newent lights on, so everyone recognises me now. It is a completely different life for me.": "Charlotte",
  "I can remember being at Sandringham, for the first time, at Christmas. And I was worried what to give the Queen as her Christmas present. I was thinking, 'Gosh, what should I give her?'. I thought, 'I'll make her something.' Which could have gone horribly wrong. But I decided to make my granny's recipe of chutney.": "Kate",
  "The first story I can remember writing, that I truly set down on paper, was a Christmas story that I wrote when I was ten years old.": "Greg",
  "Dickens was a part of how the whole celebration of Christmas as we know it today emerged during the 19th century.": "Claire",
  "'A Christmas Carol' has been described as the most perfect of Dickens's works and as a quintessential heart-warming story, and it is certainly the most popular.": "Claire",
  "I think Father Christmas is real because the belief is real. The belief becomes the reality.": "Matt",
  "Christmas comes during a season when the Earth is in its darkest time. It's a holiday for the family and for everyone.": "Melissa",
  "The whole point of me doing a Christmas record and what I centered it around was the song 'Christmas with You' from the point-of-view of the soldiers in Iraq.": "Rick",
  "The family is the focal point of our existence. And up until Jane and Lucy's death, there were always 16 of us together for Christmas.": "Richard",
  "My brothers and sisters, may the spirit of love which comes at Christmastime fill our homes and our lives and linger there long after the tree is down and the lights are put away for another year.": "Thomas",
  "What will you and I give for Christmas this year? Let us in our lives give to our Lord and Savior the gift of gratitude by living His teachings and following in His footsteps.": "Thomas",
  "I'm totally the 'decorate early, start listening to Christmas songs super early' guy. I've just always been that way.": "Drake",
  "I love the atmosphere at the mall - everything about Christmas. I don't think anything specific gets me in the holiday spirit except for the holidays themselves.": "Drake",
  "I love Christmas. I'm totally the 'decorate early, start listening to Christmas songs super-early' guy.": "Drake",
  "My parents were willing to let me follow my nose, do what I wanted to do, and they supported my interest by buying the books that I wanted for birthdays and Christmas, almost always poetry books.": "Donald",
  "I would work until I got stuck, and I would put it down and pick up something else. I might be able to take a 20-minute nap and get to work again. That way, I was able to work about 10 hours a day... It was important to me to work every day. I managed to work on Christmas day, just to be able to say I worked 365 days a year.": "Donald",
  "The only thing I liked about Christmas as a kid was the gifts; otherwise, it just seemed like a stressful time.": "Lake",
  "I've taught fifth-year Christmas leavers last thing on a Friday afternoon. Basically, if you can face that you can face anything.": "Johann",
  "So many people release albums before Christmas and they get lost in the Christmas rush.": "Bonnie",
  "I'm over the moon to be involved in the 'Doctor Who' Christmas special. I can't quite believe it as it's a part of the family tradition at the Jenkins household. I heard the news that I got the role on my 30th birthday and it was the best birthday present ever.": "Katherine",
  "Felixstowe, the United Kingdom's largest port, stops work only for Christmas Day and for crane-toppling Force 9 gales.": "Rose",
  "I used to sing in church, too. Not like in the choir or anything, but for people around the church... on the church bus going home and Christmas plays.": "Bryson",
  "I love Halloween, trick or treating and decorating the house. And I love Thanksgiving, because of the football and the fall weather. And of course, I love Christmas - that's my favorite of all!": "Joe",
  "Everybody loves a good Christmas song if you do it right.": "Sabrina",
  "Every Christmas Eve, the elves will come and give us a new pair of pajamas.": "Sabrina",
  "The vocal arrangements are a big part of the formula for a Bad Religion song - layered harmonies and background vocals. So when I start to describe the elements of Bad Religion's sound, it starts to sound like a Christmas choir.": "Greg",
  "Like my dad, I have a Christmas party most years. I like to celebrate and see as many people as possible.": "Lauren",
  "It can't be overstated how wonderful it is not to have to audition any more. Any actor will tell you, it's like Christmas.": "Bill",
  "I can't tell you how scary it can be walking onto a movie and suddenly joining this family, it's like going to somebody else's Christmas dinner, everyone knows everyone, and you're there and you're not quite sure what you're supposed to be doing.": "John",
  "Faith is salted and peppered through everything at Christmas. And I love at least one night by the Christmas tree to sing and feel the quiet holiness of that time that's set apart to celebrate love, friendship, and God's gift of the Christ child.": "Amy",
  "Come Christmas Eve, we usually go to my mom and dad's. Everybody brings one gift and then we play that game when we all steal it from each other. Some are really cool, others are useful and some are a bit out there.": "Amy",
  "Most of the soap operas always use the Christmas special to kill huge quantities of their characters. So they have trams coming off their rails, or cars slamming into each other or burning buildings. It's a general clean-out.": "Julian",
  "Black Friday is not another bad hair day in Wall Street. It's the term used by American retailers to describe the day after the Thanksgiving Holiday, seen as the semi-official start of Christmas shopping season.": "Evan",
  "I remember a great America where we made everything. There was a time when the only thing you got from Japan was a really bad cheap transistor radio that some aunt gave you for Christmas.": "Cher",
  "I had a great AP U.S. History teacher in Pittsburgh. We still exchange Christmas cards. She was the first teacher who said I was a good writer - and I'd never heard that before. And so I remember that, and I remember that level of loving the material and really loving writing about it.": "Nathaniel",
  "It was, you know, probably 80 degrees out in L.A., and my dad took me outside and there was snow. At the time, I thought, 'Every kid doesn't have snow in their backyard on Christmas?'": "Tori",
  "Well, the album 'Intuition' is out and just went platinum officially. So I think to have the music doing what it's doing right now, man, it's the ultimate. Nobody is really selling records out there but we are at a million records and we dropped it at Christmas, so we are just trying to get that thing to like two million, you know.": "Jamie",
  "I'm bad on Valentine's Day, but even worse on Christmas. I go shopping at nine o'clock on December 24th every year. Nobody else is there. I'm in Toys'R'Us all by myself. I get there five minutes before closing.": "Jamie",
  "Christmas is the time when kids tell Santa what they want and adults pay for it. Deficits are when adults tell government what they want and their kids pay for it.": "Richard",

  "Contemplating Christmas when you are isolated and far from home brings its own unique pain.": "Amanda",
  "Christmas was the one time of year when my brothers surfaced at home, when my parents and grandparents congregated to eat my mother's roast turkey.": "Amanda",
  "Santa is our culture's only mythic figure truly believed in by a large percentage of the population. It's a fact that most of the true believers are under eight years old, and that's a pity.": "Chris",
  "My family makes these vinegars - out of everything from grapes to peaches and cherries. We go through the whole process with the giant vat and drainer, label them, and give them as Christmas presents.": "Mario",
  "It is a fine seasoning for joy to think of those we love.": "Moliere",
  "The 'Story of Silent Night', which was given to me one Christmas when I was six - it was the story of a down and out composer who had no ideas left, and it was Christmas, and he came up with the hymn 'Silent Night.'": "Adriana",
  "I do have a family, and I do have friends, and so-called friends, and acquaintances, and many other people I see only around Christmas time. Maybe they could vouch for me. Maybe they could testify to my existence and save a part of me that thinks I'm no better than a bag of potato chips.": "Macaulay",
  "One of my first favorite books was 'The 12 Days of Christmas,' and I would just go up to people and say, 'I can sing 'The 12 Days of Christmas,' and I would make them sit through me reciting it, and I'd go all the way, each time. I've always hooked into lyrics.": "Lin-Manuel",
  "The first music I was ever exposed to was Irish folk music, like the Clancy Brothers. My father plays that and Christmas songs.": "Matt",
  "My Christmas wish would be to have an entire week off. To spend it with my family and just curl up and watch Christmas movies when it's snowing outside.": "David",
  "'I am a bad mother.' Every Christmas, this is what I think because the holiday season fills me with such anxiety. I'm sure that other mothers are happily baking cookies, decorating trees, and finding perfect gifts for everyone.": "Tess",
  "One of the best Christmas presents I ever got was the globe that I now keep right beside my desk.": "Tess",
  "Every singer eventually gets around to a Christmas disc.": "Renee",
  "To understand this Christmas record, you have to understand our ministry.": "John",
  "I hate to say it, but Christmas as a kid was always a moneymaking venture for me. I played trumpet, and a friend of mine who played trombone and a guy who played tuba, every Christmas we'd go out for three or four days beforehand and play Christmas carols on our horns.": "John",
  "I think I'm a lot like other moms out there who feel like if we don't have the pecan pie we have every year, then it just won't be Christmas.": "Faith",
  "I grew up asking for everything under the sun for Christmas, but I knew I wasn't going to get it all.": "Faith",
  "You don't want your jewelry to make you look fat. A lot of what's out there now does - you just wind up looking like a Christmas tree.": "Padma",
  "I stopped going to Kingdom Hall, the church, when I was 11 years old, so I was very young. They don't celebrate birthdays, you get no Christmas, so it's a very difficult religion for children to get into. And they do a lot of finger-pointing among the Jehovah's Witnesses.": "Ja",
  "Don't let the past steal your present. This is the message of Christmas: We are never alone.": "Taylor",
  "It's true, Christmas can feel like a lot of work, particularly for mothers. But when you look back on all the Christmases in your life, you'll find you've created family traditions and lasting memories. Those memories, good and bad, are really what help to keep a family together over the long haul.": "Caroline",
  "You have to remind kids to stay connected to the meaning of Christmas. Sometimes it takes a little bit of effort, but it's so worth it.": "Caroline",
  "'The Nightmare Before Christmas' is my number one biggest influence artistically in every way.": "Amy",
  "I like, 'I Believe In Father Christmas' - that is one of my favorites it is a lovely composition; 'Colder Than Winter' as well. There are so many beautiful songs.": "Sarah",
  "'A Christmas Carol' is an extravagantly symbolic thing - as rich in symbols as Christmas pudding is rich in raisins.": "Michel",
  "I spent 250 to 300 days of every year on the road. But in the end, I felt something was missing. I needed to be anchored so I could concentrate, so in 2000, I established a new methodology - the one I use today. I spent the week in my office and travelled every weekend, even at Christmas.": "Hans-Ulrich",
  "I know 'Hallelujah' isn't actually a Christmas song, but it has that cozy, haunting vibe that sounds like a winter's night and belongs by a fire.": "Bonnie",
  "Why not share with the world the way it is and tell them my feelings about my cat, and how I played with my kids, and how addicted to Christmas time I am, and the smell of pine needles and hearing my kids laugh.": "Steven",
  "I remember when I was working at Sprint, I'd work on my birthday, New Year's Day, and even Christmas Eve. I'm just used to working on my birthday, so I'll be celebrating it afterward.": "Prince",
  "From a very young age, I liked to take apart things. All of my Christmas gifts would wind up in a million pieces. I actually recall taking apart my dad's lawnmower three times to understand how combustible engines work.": "Homaro",
  "I absolutely adore Christmas.": "Aurora",
  "New Year's Eve to Valentine's Day is our peak season, and in many ways, Valentine's Day is our Christmas. Everybody in the world makes the same three New Year's resolutions: health, career and money, and love.": "Sam",
  "There's been a concerted effort to steal Christmas.": "Jerry",
  "I eat everything I want on Christmas day. I really don't watch what I eat. It's not like you have Christmas every day!": "Adriana",
  "Christmas carols always brought tears to my eyes. I also cry at weddings. I should have cried at a couple of my own.": "Ethel",
  "My father used to always give me a basketball, a skate board, and a bike every Christmas. That's all I wanted every year.": "Amar'e",
  "Britain's passion for Christmas and huge white weddings dates from Victorian times - both were low-key celebrations before Victoria and her PR machine.": "Kate",
  "When I was five years old, I auditioned for the role of 'Tiny Tim in A Christmas Carol.'": "Zach",
  "My grandmother was a church organist, but we only went on Easter and Christmas Eve sometimes.": "Zach",
  "I'm sure most of us remember being a kid and you have all of this endless time where two weeks before Christmas feels like ten years. I used to go to bed to try and go to sleep to try and make it go faster.": "Andrea",
  "At Christmas time, I spent an extortionate amount of money on Buzz Lightyear toys, baby clothes, Disney cars and the like.": "Russell",
  "'El Gordo' is the name given to the oldest lottery jackpot in the world - and the richest. Held every year in Madrid on December 22, the Christmas Lottery culminates with the picking of the El Gordo number, the Fat One, which, for many, has become the true Christmas miracle in Spain.": "Michael",
  "For Christmas I do gift bags for my friends and the cast, and I put 'treat yo self' key chains in there. And people send me pictures of 'treat yo self' all the time.": "Retta",
  "I write seven days a week, starting at 4 o'clock in the morning, including Christmas.": "Dan",
  "My parents got me a $25 Kent steel-string acoustic guitar when I was around 12. The following Christmas, my parents bought me a Conora electric guitar. It looked almost like a Gretsch. It cost $59, and my mom still has it.": "Alex",
  "My mother accidentally gave me food poisoning. She fed me baby carrots for a snack before Christmas dinner - but they had expired in June! I threw up for the next 24 hours.": "Busy",
  "I want to go to Lapland and see Father Christmas, and now I've got a child, so I've got an excuse. Also, I'd like to go to South America especially as I'm now living in that part of the world, in L.A. now. And I must get down to Mexico.": "Ashley",
  "The real evidence for Jesus and Christianity is in how Jesus and the Christianity based on him manifest themselves in the lives of practicing Christians.": "Lionel",
  "Kind 'Guardian' readers have been forwarding me round robin Christmas newsletters for years now: lengthy missives full of perfect children, exotic holidays, talented pets and endless, tedious detail. The notes that accompanied them revealed they had inspired in the original recipients everything from mild irritation to absolute rage.": "Simon",
  "I've not cooked Christmas dinner since 1982.": "Lesley",
  "When I was eight years old, I got a dummy for Christmas and started teaching myself. I got books and records and sat in front of the bathroom mirror, practising. I did my first show in the third grade and just kept going; there was no reason to quit.": "Jeff",
  "'Make your plate look like a Christmas tree,' I tell people, 'mostly green with splashes of other bright colors.'": "Victoria",
  "I read everything. I'll read a John Grisham novel, I'll sit and read a whole book of poems by Maya Angelou, or I'll just read some Mary Oliver - this is a book that was given to me for Christmas. No particular genre. And I read in French, and I read in German, and I read in English. I love to see how other people use language.": "Jessye",
  "There I am, watching Philip Seymour Hoffman, one of my favourite actors in the world, walk into the room dressed up as Father Christmas, being hilarious, and I'm suddenly thinking, 'Where am I?'": "Tom",
  "I'm learning Spanish - I got Rosetta Stone for Christmas.": "Karlie",
  "Christmas is a time of year that's so romantic.": "Katharine",
  "The truth is the Super Bowl long ago became more than just a football game. It's part of our culture like turkey at Thanksgiving and lights at Christmas, and like those holidays beyond their meaning, a factor in our economy.": "Bob",
  "My mom always makes the whole family pile into the car and drive around to look at the Christmas lights. My brother and I never want to do it, but my mom just loves it!": "Debby",
  "I get very unsettled by the mess of Christmas. I find the decorations a little bit hard, as my desire for everything to match is never fully satisfied.": "Jade",
  "To perceive Christmas through its wrappings becomes more difficult with every year.": "E.",
  "As a child, I was bonkers for Christmas. The entire month of December, I couldn't sleep at night from anticipation.": "Rosecrans",
  "I was 23 when I learned how to cook; I grew up around the same time. It was precisely then that Thanksgiving started to mean something more. Growing up, Christmas was always about me, and eventually you, when I finally started to enjoy the giving part. But Thanksgiving is always about us.": "Rosecrans",
  "I don't like most Christmas movies. They're pretty bad, though they seem to make tons of money anyway. Like this movie 'Elf,' I got the script for that, and I turned it down right away. Against my wife's better judgment.": "Terry",
  "The last Christmas movie I really liked was 'It's a Wonderful Life,' probably. It's sort of a schmaltzy movie, but it's not without its dark moments. It still gets to me every year.": "Terry",
  "I'm a big hit at parties. Friends ask me to sing B-I-N-G-O all the time. I'm thinking, you know, of maybe putting out a Christmas album or something.": "Paula",
  "Fantastic! Right in the middle of that long stretch between Christmas and Spring Break, your coats are getting dirty, everything's dark, dingy - what a great time for a movie!": "John",
  "Christmas is a stocking stuffed with sugary goodness.": "Mo",
  "I love the excess of Christmas. The shopping season that begins in September, the bad pop star recordings of Christmas carols, the decorations that don't know when to come down.": "Mo",
  "One Christmas my father kept our tree up till March. He hated to see it go. I loved that.": "Mo",
  "I used to know Jennifer Love Hewitt. We lived in the same apartment building when I was about... jeez, I guess it was when I was doing 'Christmas Vacation', so I was about 13 or 14.": "Johnny",
  "There's a lot of movies that aren't all about Christmas, or where Christmas isn't the focus, but have that spirit of Christmas in them. I love that sequence in 'Auntie Mame,' where she's in the department store, sewing at Macy's, and she doesn't know how to do anything but fill out a form as 'cash on delivery!'": "Robert",
  "I'm still a Chicagoan in the fact that I can't do Christmas with sand and palm trees. It just doesn't compute - it's not Christmas unless your face hurts when you step outside.": "Johnny",
  "I like day-after-Christmas omelets, day-after Christmas pizzas... Or you take croissant rolls, put gravy on top, turkey, mashed potatoes, cheese, more gravy. That sounds good!": "Eric",
  "I had written a book that dealt with really serious issues. Was anybody going to want to read a Christmas love story from me?": "Jay",
  "Christmas is more stressful with present buying and making sure everyone gets included, but Thanksgiving is really not that. I don't ever really get stressed out about the food.": "Sandra",
  "My mother died of metastatic colorectal cancer shortly before three P.M. on Christmas Day of 2008. I don't know the exact time of her death, because none of us thought to look at a clock for a while after she stopped breathing.": "Meghan",
  "I loved the first Christmas I had in England.": "Blythe",
  "My grandson sees me as Lois on TV every Christmas, and that scores me points.": "Margot",
  "I've played D&D for years. I'm a comic book guy. Comic-Con in San Diego is nerd Christmas for me.": "Brian",
  "I got given a pair of Christmas socks with penguins on. They know you're obviously not going to wear them. I think they do it just to annoy you, to be honest.": "Jamie",
  "I have a love/hate relationship with Amy Grant, but I do go back to her Christmas albums once in a while. They're dated and sentimental and the production is nearly unlistenable, but there's something about her vocal performance that just feels really true. I would take her Christmas albums over Mariah Carey's or Destiny's Child's any day.": "Sufjan",
  "I don't know if that's a year's bad luck, or if that's how it works. But stealing a Christmas tree - that can't be a good thing, karma-wise.": "Adrian",
  "Accounts of eating Christmas sweet potatoes baked in ashes and jackrabbit stewed with white flour dumplings are testaments to pioneer resilience and pleasure - and they help inspire my own best scratch cooking.": "Isabel",
  "It's more like Christmas, you know, when you get a shot in that looks great and it's exactly what you want. It's a great feeling, and there's nothing like it.": "Zack",
  "Some of my favorite records growing up were Christmas albums. The ones I liked best were the albums that you could listen to from start to finish. You could put them on while you're decorating the tree or driving around looking at Christmas lights.": "Chris",
  "I wanted to have more songs with religious backgrounds. The Christmas record has strong, traditional hymns, but it also has a song called 'Christmas in Heaven' about missing someone that you love that's passed on, and wondering what's going on up there on Christmas.": "Scotty",
  "A title means marketing. It means that company's coming soon, and you'd better get out the Christmas lights so they don't miss your house.": "Caroline",
  "You know, I started my career in politics in 1967. I'm not new to this. I did not just fall off the Christmas tree. I understand the world is complex. I know that there are people out there who want to hurt other people.": "Dennis",
  "My wife's brother has a little house on a small island in the Baltic Sea, and we go there at Christmas. The 30-minute crossing from the mainland to this island is the most terrifying cruise you'll ever take. They give you a barf bag when you walk on board.": "Nick",
  "I became hugely overweight and then hated myself because it was a form of self-abuse, something over which I had no control. I think the thing compulsive over-eaters want to achieve is that stuffed-full Christmas afternoon feeling.": "Marcus",
  "The ebulliently sharp mind of 'White Christmas' director Walter Bobbie made me tremble and strive in the same breath. The deceptively 'simple' dialogue of David Ives, asking every actor to just. say. it. Float it on the breeze; it doesn't need 'explanation,' just energy and truth.": "David",
  "My mother would give my brothers and me a pile of catalogues and let us pick what we wanted for Christmas.": "Kary",
  "We have 40 people over for Thanksgiving, 30 people for Easter lunch, 35 people on Christmas Eve. People tend to expect to spend their holidays with us, which is lovely and an expectation I carry with pride.": "Sonya",
  "Being half Jewish, we grew up with Christmas trees but had Jewish ornaments.": "Gina",
  "For a Jewish guy, I've recorded a lot of Christmas albums.": "Barry",
  "First of all, I've been having a wonderful run of luck with cover albums, songs I didn't write. I had five pop cover albums and two Christmas albums, and they were all very successful.": "Barry",
  "My earliest, most impactful encounter with a book was when I was seven and awoke early on Christmas morning to find Roald Dahl's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' in my stocking. I had never been so excited by the sight of a book - and have possibly never been since!": "Sophie",
  "I just travel all the time. And I was just looking at the schedules now and starting the first week of October I will be every weekend with somebody at tournaments through Christmas. So it gets very difficult to just go away and not do that.": "Ivan",
  "On Christmas Eve, we have a duck or roast pork with caramelised potatoes, braised red cabbage and gravy. For dessert, we have ris a l'amande, a rice pudding, and whoever gets the whole almond in it wins an extra present. Then we dance around the tree and sing carols.": "Birgitte",
  "One lived in the impression that nobody could ever compete with the 'Nutcracker' or 'A Christmas Carol.'": "Gian",
  "We try to make the name longer and longer every year. First, it was 'Larry the Cable Guy's Christmas Spectacular.' Then it was 'It's a Very Larry Christmas.' Now it's 'Larry the Cable Guy's Hula-palooza Christmas Luau.' I'll tell you what it is: It's funny. That's what it is. Who cares what the name of it is? It is a funny special.": "Larry",
  "The earliest you can play Christmas music is on Thanksgiving.": "Tinashe",
  "For many of us, Christmas lunch is the most special meal of the year - and I certainly want nothing but the very best for this celebration.": "Sheherazade",
  "Farmers' markets are one of my favourite sources for Christmas goodies.": "Sheherazade",
  "I was lucky enough to grow up in a home where I woke up Christmas morning and had toys. I know that's not the case with all people and I don't think kids should go without experiencing that sort of joy.": "Lucy",
  "My favorite toy growing up was Polly Pocket. But one gift that I wanted though never received for Christmas was a pair of trampoline moon shoes. You strap them to your feet and they have springs on them, and you can just jump around!": "Lucy",
  "The sharpest memory of our old-fashioned Christmas eve is my mother's hand making sure I was settled in bed.": "Paul",
  "At Christmas, 'It's a Wonderful Life' makes me cry in exactly the same places every time, even though I know it's coming.": "Nicholas",
  "All families had their special Christmas food. Ours was called Dutch Bread, made from a dough halfway between bread and cake, stuffed with citron and every sort of nut from the farm - hazel, black walnut, hickory, butternut.": "Paul",
  "Every Christmas should begin with the sound of bells, and when I was a child mine always did. But they were sleigh bells, not church bells, for we lived in a part of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, where there were no churches.": "Paul",
  "Most Americans acquire dogs impulsively and for dubious reasons: as a Christmas gift for the kids. Because they saw one in a movie. To match the new living-room furniture. Because they moved to the suburbs and see a dog as part of the package.": "Jon",
  "The earth has grown old with its burden of care, but at Christmas it always is young, the heart of the jewel burns lustrous and fair, and its soul full of music breaks the air, when the song of angels is sung.": "Phillips",
  "I grew up poor, but I didn't really know it because of amazing places like the Salvation Army where we got a lot of our Christmas presents from.": "Trey",
  "I'm a disorganized mess. My purse is gross: I once found a shoulder pad, string cheese, and a Christmas ornament in it!": "Hoda",
  "May I share with you my earliest memory of a political row? It was with my mother, about the Queen - classic Freudian stuff, shrinks would say. I was eight, and refusing to watch the Queen's Christmas Day broadcast.": "Alastair",
  "I absolutely adore Agatha Christie; so much so that when I received a kitten for my Christmas present, I called her Agatha, and I already have a cat called Hercule!": "Kimberley",
  "I simply believe food is too good to throw away - and Christmas leftovers can be a gastronomic opportunity for the well-skilled kitchen forager. With a little imagination, there are a million ways to use up leftovers rather than bin them.": "Tristram",
  "I'd just got back from filming my role as Flo in 'Kidnap & Ransom' when I got the news that Channel 4 had re-commissioned 'Fresh Meat,' so I think it was the first Christmas I could actually relax knowing that I had three months' work sorted. As an actor, that's always a good feeling.": "Kimberley",
  "You know how on Christmas day, the day feels different, even if you're just sitting in your chair waiting for your girlfriend to put her face on and you haven't even started any of the festivities yet, the day still feels different. The electrons are fatter and pushier.": "Bill",
  "'A Christmas Story' is my favorite Christmas movie.": "Paul",
  "One thing I hear a lot is, 'Dude, my mom loves your record,' or 'I got it for my dad for Christmas.' I'm essentially doing dad rock. Which is great, because I love Steely Dan, you know? Nothing wrong with dad rock!": "Mac",
  "On the whole, I prefer Christmas as an adult than I did as a child.": "Nigella",
  "The Christmas story has such power and such appeal every year. There are other stories we get tired of. You think of your favorite movie you don't want to watch it 15 times. ": "Frederica",
  "Somehow we just don't make the same boisterous fun of Holy Week that we do of Christmas. No one plans to have a holly, jolly Easter.": "Frederica",
  "Easter may seem boring to children, and it is blessedly unencumbered by the silly fun that plagues Christmas. Yet it contains the one thing needful for every human life: the good news of Resurrection.": "Frederica",
  "Pets, like their owners, tend to expand a little over the Christmas period.": "Frances",
  "When I was five my parents bought me a ukulele for Christmas. I quickly learned how to play it with my father's guidance. Thereafter, my father regularly taught me all the good old fashioned songs.": "Tony",
  "Our last jam session was this past Christmas. Dad played his harmonica, mom sang in English and Italian, and I played guitar. I'm so happy that we could share that musical experience for one last time.": "Tony",
  "From the time that I can remember, I worked to make money - either baby-sitting, or one year wrapping gifts at a department store at Christmas, so I could have my own money.": "Christie",
  "We always had lutefisk for Christmas dinner, after which Dad read from the Norwegian Bible.": "Peter",
  "I think we felt the pressure more at first than this time around. But still you don't want to let anyone down. I never even met Patrick until we had a Christmas party at Ian McKellen's house on the first movie and then I didn't see him again until the premiere.": "Rebecca",
  "When it comes to referring to Dickens's life, performing plays with your nine children for friends and family during Christmas is Dickensian.": "Matthew",
  "I love Christmas. Christmas is family time.": "Brody",
  "Christmas is taken very seriously in this household. I believe in Father Christmas, and there's no way I'd do anything to undermine that belief.": "Carol",
  "At Christmas our house is like a Donnie and Marie Christmas Special.": "Kevin",
  "I really want a Christmas in New York one year, when it's snowing. Like, it's Christmas morning, and you have a fight with someone, and you run down the street, and it's snowing, and you can't find them.": "Courtney",
  "I read the Scriptures at the American Cathedral on Christmas and Easter that's it. It's a task I love. ": "Olivia",
  "Now, the essence, the very spirit of Christmas is that we first make believe a thing is so, and lo, it presently turns out to be so.": "Stephen",
  "Whatever he does should be seen as working at the Presidency and if he goes to Colorado for Christmas, it should be for a minimum amount of time, the family tradition and family get-together aspect emphasized, and it be seen as a working vacation.": "Robert",
  "I think we need one recognized, respected public figure to make a tough, blunt statement on just what Reagan's record is and what he might do to the country, let alone the Republican Party before Christmas.": "Robert",
  "I never really did Christmas before. Christmas Day? I mean - what's that? What's it all about? I was always flying on Christmas Day.": "Monica",
  "Did you know that Christmas Day is absolutely the best day to fly? It is. No crowded airports and crowded planes. I always flew to Australia. That's what Christmas was for me - a plane journey to the next tournament.": "Monica",
  "A friend gave me a CD of the 'Pathetique' Symphony as a Christmas present. I went home, and I put on the CD expecting to listen to Tchaikovsky. But it started 'ta ta ta taaa.' It was too long for me. I didn't understand it at first, but then I fell in love, in love, in love.": "Gustavo",
  "During the first 13 centuries after the birth of Jesus in Bethlehem, no one thought of setting up a creche to celebrate Christmas. The pre-eminent Christian holiday was Easter, not Christmas.": "Nancy",
  "We are each one on a road going toward home, but we're not trying to get there for Christmas. We're trying to get there for eternity. We want to arrive home safely to our loving Father in Heaven. He wants us to make it safely there, so He has sent a guiding light for us to follow: a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, the perfect example.": "Margaret",
  "Christmas is the season I use to clock failure in life. It stops time, as it were, on the year - where you are in it, where you are in your travail unto the grave.": "Padgett",
  "I associate the truest spirit of Christmas with certain years when I had to spend it at my parents' house as an adult who had, presumably, escaped.": "Padgett",
  "At every Christmas, I fail to remember the daughters' shoe sizes, and they are not growing, but grown. After ostensible hard thought about who needs what, I have failed to give good gifts; I have failed to receive good gifts.": "Padgett",
  "I'm not romantic, and I don't like Christmas.": "Paula",
  "People think it's terribly sad to spend Christmas alone, but it's no sadder, really, than spending any other day alone, is it?": "Paula",
  "I was a postman one Christmas and I developed a morbid fear of dogs.": "Diane",
  "My parents still treat Christmas like I'm thirteen years old.": "Mike",
  "I was supposed to be working on 'The Weekenders,' but I was blocked. I got this crazy idea that I would make Christmas stockings out of blankets.": "Mary",
  "For a writer, capturing that elusive Christmas morning magic can be deeply problematic.": "Mary",
  "I picked up the guitar at 12 yrs old - basically, my mother and father bought it for me for Christmas. I played one at my friend's house; when I say played it, I just played around with it at my friend's house. It just struck me as something I really wanted.": "Greg",
  "A lot of sequins for New Year's! Red, green, white - I fail at all of that because I'm always in black. But for Christmas, I do love wearing cute dresses with tights and a pair of boots.": "Ashley",
  "Christmas 1972 was a lonely time for Kissinger, as well as for his boss, and a period of serious reflection. Kissinger was then a bachelor, enamored of the tall, elegant, but elusive WASP Nancy Maginnes, but still very much a bachelor - Washington's most sought-after bachelor.": "Alistair",
  "And of course there's so much music in and around our family. I had a piano during Christmas because it's obviously useful through the season. There are so many people, songwriters, who are around.": "Ashley",
  "He put a ring in the toe of a stocking. On Christmas Eve, we opened our stockings and it was there at the bottom of the toe. Then he got down on his knees and he was shaking.": "Kyra",
  "I got a guitar when I was about 14, for a Christmas present, and went from there.": "Robin",
  "Every year, like a good Catholic, I wait for Christmas. Putting up the lights, decorating the tree, making sweets and then unwrapping gifts on Christmas morning... it's a tradition my family has followed since I was very little.": "Malaika",
  "For me, the spirit of Christmas means being happy and giving freely. It's a tradition for all the kids in the family to help mom decorate the tree. Christmas is all about family, eating, drinking and making merry.": "Malaika",
  "No matter where I am in the world, I will always be back home for Christmas.": "Malaika",
  "Mom still has a huge, beautifully decorated Christmas tree. The whole family comes together after midnight mass and has the traditional plum cake and wine. We spend the night at mom's home, and in the morning we wake up and open the presents. In the afternoon, we sit down to have a traditional Christmas lunch.": "Malaika",
  "I'd love to have a Christmas classic under my belt. It's hard to write a Christmas song.": "Patty",
  "My first job, 9 years old, part-time, was selling Christmas cards door-to-door. Ten years old, my brother and I had paper routes. We delivered a morning paper called the 'L.A. Examiner.' Get up at 4 o'clock, fold your papers, deliver them and get ready for school.": "John",
  "I'd like to do a Christmas album. I've never done a Christmas album.": "Tanya",
  "I was thrilled one year when I was younger when not only did my brothers get hockey sticks for Christmas - but I did too!": "Nancy",
  "Adults are tempted to produce and perform Christmas for their kids and their families, and they arrive at Christmas Day weary and disillusioned.": "Ann",
  "A simplified Christmas isn't about circumstances as much as it is about focus.": "Ann",
  "I love giving gifts and I love receiving them. I really like giving little kids extravagant gifts. You see their little faces light up and they get excited. If it's a really good gift, I love receiving it, like jewels, small islands.": "Gina",
  "There are a lot of Grinches out there that would like nothing better than to take any references to religion out of the holiday season.": "Ernest",
  "I got this Christmas gift with the entire Beatles catalog. I had fun trying to duplicate what I was hearing on these records, only using the instruments I had at hand - an acoustic guitar, and that's all. It was endlessly amusing to me to try to imitate John Lennon and Paul McCartney's harmonies using the guitar.": "M.",
  "I'd have to say, for me, as a child, my favorite memories were always centered around Christmas time. It always seemed like no matter how much money my parents had or didn't have, we got completely spoiled rotten. There were always presents under the tree, and we always did special things, like hide elves around the house.": "Josie",
  "I love presents, But since I've gotten older, I haven't really wanted anything. Christmas is about family.": "Jacob",
  "In our open society, we are inclined to give to the less fortunate for the pure goodness of giving. We open our home to those who are alone on this holiday to spread some warmth into the life of another.": "Jeff",
  "Mail your packages early so the post office can lose them in time for Christmas.": "Johnny",
  "Now, a lot of what we are doing right now, quite frankly, is because of what happened on Christmas. Many of the things were kind of in the works. We were already planning, for example, the purchase and deployment of advanced imaging technology. You call them body scanners. We call them AITs (Advanced Imaging Technologies).": "Janet",
  "It will be a hard game if you think about winning a championship. We need to think about our own game at the moment and focus on getting good results especially over the Christmas period.": "Dennis",
  "I was at the vice president's Christmas party. I thought that his speech was spectacular, and I knew that it was a very emotional and difficult thing for him to do, but I admonished him for not waiting just one more stinking day.": "Bradley",
  "There's a little Christmas in all of us, I guess. Even in me.": "Leon",
  "In the spring of 1994 I decided not to seek reelection to the Senate. I had made the decision 12 years earlier, Christmas Day of 1982, just after I had been first elected to a full term, that I would do the best I could for a limited time.": "George",
  "The next thing I wrote was in a writing class at night school. It was about a poor woman who worked at a dime store and who was all alone for Christmas in Laurel, Mississippi.": "Beth",
  "To me, the most important thing is to wear something that I love and feel comfortable in, and Christmas is a great opportunity to get one of my old favourites out.": "Amber",
  "It's easy to write a short story and frighten people for five pages, but to work at length, when you do it as in 'The Turn Of The Screw' or 'A Christmas Carol,' it's different; you have to build it and build it.": "Susan",
  "As a youngster, when I was active in church, I had a lot of fun choosing and hanging massive stars and making the cribs. I was also very involved in the Christmas plays, though not as an actor, but I took joy in setting up the props.": "Nivin",
  "When 'I'm Sorry' came out and became such a huge hit, that made 'Rockin' Around The Christmas Tree' start selling. Then that became a huge, huge hit.": "Brenda",
  "The worst gift that I ever gave a girl was a suitcase for Christmas. As in, 'I can't think of anything to give you, but here's a new suitcase.' Afterward, I was like, 'What were you thinking, idiot?'": "Jensen",
