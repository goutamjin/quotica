  "If Christians realized that God Himself in the person of the Holy Spirit really dwells within our bodies, we would be far more careful about what we eat, drink, look at, or read. No wonder Paul said, \u201cI beat my body and make it my slave\u201d [1 Corinthians 9:27 NIV]. This should drive us to our knees in confession.": "Billy",
  "Faithfulness is produced by the Holy Spirit in a yielded Christian life.": "Billy",
  "It is never a question of how much you and I have of the Spirit, but how much He has of us.": "Billy",
  "Because [the Holy Spirit] is a spirit, [He] isn\u2019t limited by time or space. He can be everywhere at once. He is in the midst of the largest galaxy\u2014and the smallest atom.": "Billy",
  "If you know Christ, you don\u2019t need to beg for the Holy Spirit to come into your life; He is already there\u2014whether you \u201cfeel\u201d His presence or not. Don\u2019t confuse the Holy Spirit with an emotional feeling or a particular type of spiritual experience.": "Billy",
  "Sometimes I feel so helpless and inadequate, and wonder if I have done enough to make the Gospel clear. But I also know that only the Holy Spirit can open others\u2019 eyes to the truth.": "Billy",
  "We shouldn\u2019t refer to the Spirit as \u201cit\u201d; instead we should always refer to the Spirit as \u201cHe\u201d\u2014because the Holy Spirit is a Person. He speaks to us, He commands us, He intercedes for us, He hears us, He guides us.": "Billy",
  "The home is basically a sacred institution . . . Faith in Christ is the most important of all principles in the building of a happy marriage and a successful home.": "Billy",
  "Home was a refuge for me, a place I could truly relax.": "Billy",
  "My wife Ruth once said, \u201cIf our children have the background of a godly, happy home and this unshakeable faith that the Bible is indeed the Word of God, they will have a foundation that the forces of hell cannot shake.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that our homes should be hospitable and that those who come in and out of our homes should sense the presence of Christ.": "Billy",
  "The happiest Christian homes I know are those given to hospitality, where neighbors feel at home, where young people are welcome, where the elderly are respected, where children are loved.": "Billy",
  "God undertook the most dramatic rescue operation in cosmic history. He determined to save the human race from self-destruction, and He sent His Son Jesus Christ to salvage and redeem them. The work of man\u2019s redemption was accomplished at the cross.": "Billy",
  "The cross is the suffering love of God bearing the guilt of man\u2019s sin, which alone is able to melt the sinner\u2019s heart and bring him to repentance for salvation. \u201cFor he hath made him to be sin for us\u201d [2 Corinthians 5:21 KJV].": "Billy",
  "The heart of the Christian Gospel with its incarnation and atonement is in the cross and the resurrection. Jesus was born to die.": "Billy",
  "Why is it that the cross has become the symbol of Christianity? It is because at the cross Jesus purchased our redemptionand provided a righteousness which we could not ourselves earn.": "Billy",
  "The ground is level at the foot of the cross.": "Billy",
  "It was not the people or the Roman soldiers who put [Jesus] on the cross\u2014it was your sins and my sins that made it necessary for Him to volunteer his death.": "Billy",
  "Two thousand years ago God invited a morally corrupt world to the foot of the cross. There God held your sins and mine to the flames until every last vestige of our guilt was consumed.": "Billy",
  "It has been said there was a cross in the heart of God long before the cross was erected at Calvary. As we think about it we will be overwhelmed at the wonder and greatness of His love for us.": "Billy",
  "When Jesus hung on the cross, a great unseen cosmic battle raged in the heavens\u2014and in the end, Christ triumphed over all the forces of evil and death and hell.": "Billy",
  "The greatest vision of sin that a person canever receive is to look at the cross.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s house will be happy because Christ will be there.": "Billy",
  "Though the cross repels, it also attracts. It possesses a magnetic quality.": "Billy",
  "Once you have been to the cross, you will never be the same.": "Billy",
  "Heaven doesn\u2019t make this life less important": "it",
  "In heaven . . . the \u201ccommunication gap\u201d will be closed.": "Billy",
  "To take up your cross means to associate yourself with Christ and to share His rejection. It means you take a stand for Christ even though people make fun of you, persecute you\u2014or even kill you!": "Billy",
  "The Bible says that as long as we are here on earth, we are strangers in a foreign land. There are enemies to be conquered before we return home. This world is not our home; our citizenship is in heaven.": "Billy",
  "Only in heaven will we know exactly what heaven is like.": "Billy",
  "We were equipped by our Creator not only to live on this earth, but also to live in touch with heaven. This was the Great Design of the Great Designer.": "Billy",
  "There are restrictions to entering heaven. The Scripture says: \u201cNothing impure will ever enter [heaven], nor will anyone who does what is shameful or deceitful, but only those whose names are written in the Lamb\u2019s book of life\u201d [Revelation 21:27 NIV].": "Billy",
  "Only one answer will give a person the certain privilege, the joy, of entering heaven. \u201cBecause I have believed in Jesus Christ and accepted Him as my Savior.": "Billy",
  "Even when we allow our imaginations to run wild on the joys of heaven, we find that our minds are incapable of conceiving what it will be like.": "Billy",
  "What a thrilling future for those of us who know that some day we will populate the kingdom of God.": "Billy",
  "In our resurrection bodies we will know nothing of physical weakness. Limitations imposed on us on this earth are not known in heaven. We will have a habitation from God that is incorruptible, immortal, and powerful.": "Billy",
  "In heaven I\u2019ll wish with all my heart that I could reclaim a thousandth part of the time I\u2019ve let slip through my fingers, that I could call back those countless conversations which could have glorified my Lord\u2014but didn\u2019t.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t let the burdens and hardships of this lifedistract you or discourage you, but keep your eyes firmly fixed on what God has promisedat the end of our journey: heaven itself.": "Billy",
  "The most thrilling thing about heaven is that Jesus Christ will be there. I will see Him face to face. Jesus Christ will meet us at the end of life\u2019s journey.": "Billy",
  "Heavenly rest will be so refreshing that we will never feel that exhaustion of mind and body we so frequently experience now. I\u2019m really looking forward to that.": "Billy",
  "Nothing made by the hand of man has ever been so beautiful as starlight on the water or moonlight on the snow. And the same hand that made trees and fields and flowers, the seas and hills, the clouds and sky, has been making a home for us called heaven.": "Billy",
  "A Christian\u2019s citizenship may be in heaven, but he has obligations as a citizen of earth. Both living with Christ and going to be with Him in death are greatly to be desired.": "Billy",
  "If Jesus had not risen from the dead, no right-minded person would have glorified anything so hideous and repulsive as a cross stained with the blood of Jesus . . .An unopened grave would never have opened heaven.": "Billy",
  "Be willing to be sneered at than to be approved, counting the cross of Christ greater riches than all the treasures of Washington, London, Paris, or Moscow.": "Billy",
  "The law enables us to see ourselves as morally dirty and in need of cleansing. But it also points us to the place of cleansing: the cross of Christ.": "Billy",
  "The cross is the only way of salvation. And the cross gives a new purpose to life.": "Billy",
  "The cross shows the seriousness of our sin\u2014but it also shows us the immeasurable love of God.": "Billy",
  "Jesus was born with the cross darkening His pathway . . . From the cradle to the cross, [Jesus\u2019] purpose was to die.": "Billy",
  "Jesus Christ opened heaven\u2019s door for us by His death on the cross.": "Billy",
  "Great crowds followed our Lord . . . as He healed the sick, raised the dead, and fed the hungry. However, the moment He started talking about the cross . . . \u201cmany . . . no longer followed him\u201d (John 6:66 NIV).": "Billy",
  "Sin was conquered on the cross. [Christ\u2019s] death is the foundation of our hope, the promise of our triumph!": "Billy",
  "Had Satan not set himself in opposition to God . . . there would have been no need for God to send His Son to the cross.": "Billy",
  "One-third of Matthew . . . one-third of Mark . . . one-fourth of Luke, and one-half of John are given to [Christ\u2019s] death . . .Jesus came for the express purpose of dying for sinners. When He left heaven, He knew He was going to the cross.": "Billy",
  "Sin\u2019s masterpiece of shame and hate became God\u2019s masterpiece of mercy and forgiveness. Through the death of Christ upon the cross, sin itself was crucified for those who believe in Him.": "Billy",
  "The cross has become a symbol in much of the Western world, misused by many rock stars and others who do not comprehend its significance.": "Billy",
  "How do we get our values so mixed up? We look for shortcuts to happiness. Our lust for immediate pleasure prompts us to think of evil as good.": "Billy",
  "There is legitimate pleasure, which is not wrong, but we are not to become so preoccupied with its activities that it takes the place of God.": "Billy",
  "We have at our fingertips every pleasure that man is capable of enjoying, and man has abused every gift God ever gave him.": "Billy",
  "We are like a restless sea, finding a little peace here and a little pleasure there, but nothing permanent and satisfying. So the search continues!": "Billy",
  "[Mankind has] allowed worldly desires and pleasures to fill the heart and mind. Whatever the sin, we need to repent and turn to Jesus Christ in faith for forgiveness and new life.": "Billy",
  "Many of us have no appetite for spiritual things because we are absorbed in the sinful pleasures of this world. We have been eating too many of the devil\u2019s delicacies.": "Billy",
  "Today our world is mad in its obsession with pleasure, sex, and money. Its ear is too dull to hear the truth. Most men\u2019s eyes are blind. They do not want to see. They do not want to hear. They hurry to their doom.": "Billy",
  "Salvation is always \u201cgood news.\u201d It is news of God\u2019s love and forgiveness\u2014adoption into His family\u2014fellowship with His people\u2014freedom from the penalty of sin\u2014liberation from the power of sin.": "Billy",
  "Your salvation is a free gift, made possible only because God planned it . . .Christ paid for it . . . and the Holy Spirit assures you of it.": "Billy",
  "God doesn\u2019t say to be perfect and you\u2019ll get to heaven. He says to confess that you\u2019re a sinner and come to the cross, and whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is primarily concerned with the story of man\u2019s redemption as it is in Jesus Christ. If you read Scripture and miss the story of salvation, you have missed its message and its meaning.": "Billy",
  "If Satan can\u2019t keep you away from Christ, he will at least try to make you doubt your salvation.": "Billy",
  "Your salvation depends on what [Christ] has done for you, not on what you do for Him. It isn\u2019t your hold on God that saves you; it\u2019s His hold on you.": "Billy",
  "Believers in Christ owe nothing to God in payment for salvation . . . but they do owe God a life of undivided devotion and service.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s grace\u2014His goodness and love toward us in spite of our sin\u2014is the wellspring of our salvation.": "Billy",
  "The blood of Christ justifies and saves us . . .The word justification means \u201cjust as if you had never sinned.": "Billy",
  "God longs for men to be saved. God is at work to get men to stop their downward plunge in sin.": "Billy",
  "Salvation is an act of God. It is initiated by God, wrought by God, and sustained by God.": "Billy",
  "How can men boast that they control their own destiny when they cannot solve the problems of war, racism, poverty, sickness, or suffering?": "Billy",
  "Patience is the transcendent radiance of a loving and tender heart which, in its dealings with those around it, looks kindly and graciously upon them.": "Billy",
  "The Christian . . . way of daily living must be distinct from the world. While some will think you \u201cpeculiar,\u201d do not let this disturb you, for just as many others will secretly admire you for your stand. It is possible you will be persecuted by jokes and be misunderstood . . .but if you accept this with patience and in the spirit of love, God can use this very thing to help you win some of your friends [to Christ].": "Billy",
  "Patience includes perseverance\u2014the ability to bear up under weariness, strain, and persecution when doing the work of the Lord.": "Billy",
  "Patience graciously, compassionately and with understanding, judges the faults of others without unjust criticism.": "Billy",
  "God allows difficulties, inconveniences, trials, and even suffering to come our way for a specific purpose: They help develop the right attitude for the growth of patience.": "Billy",
  "Patience is part of true Christlikeness, something we so often admire in others without demanding it of ourselves.": "Billy",
  "Patience in our lives springs from God\u2019s power based upon our willingness to learn it.": "Billy",
  "We have some of the finest civil rights laws in the world, but they have not solved our racial problems. Why? Because we need a change of heart and attitude, Jesus said, \u201cYou must be born again\u201d [John 3:7].": "Billy",
  "The human race has the power right now to destroy itself. Jesus Christ is going to save us from ourselves.": "Billy",
  "There is only one possible solution to the race problem and that is a vital personal experience with Jesus Christ on the part of [all] races.": "Billy",
  "God prescribes the remedy for the ills of the human race. That remedy is personal faith and commitment to Jesus Christ. The remedy is to be born again.": "Billy",
  "In Christ the middle wall of partition has been broken down. There is no Jew, no Gentile\u2014no black, white, yellow, or red. We could be one great brotherhood in Jesus Christ. However, until we come to recognize Him as the Prince of Peace and receive His love in our hearts, the racial tensions will increase, racial demands will become more militant, and a great deal of blood will be shed. The race problem could become another flame out of control!": "Billy",
  "I had not been preaching long before I decided that I would never preach to another segregated audience in any situation over which we had control. This was long before the Supreme Court decision of 1954. I felt this was the Christian position and I could do no other.": "Billy",
  "Patience . . . speaks of a person\u2019s steadfastness under provocation . . .enduring ill-treatment without anger or thought of retaliation or revenge.": "Billy",
  "Only God can break down the national and racial barriers that divide men today. Only God can supply that love that we must have for our fellowman. We will never build brotherhood of man upon earth until we are believers in Christ Jesus.": "Billy",
  "Down through the ages man\u2019s heart has remained unchanged. Whatever the color of his skin, whatever his cultural or ethnic background, he needs the Gospel of Christ.": "Billy",
  "Ancient historians tell us that one of the symptoms of a declining civilization is a desexualization of the human race, with men becoming more effeminate and women becoming more masculine, not only in physical [appearance] but in their basic characters.": "Billy",
  "The closer the people of all races get to Christ and His cross, the closer they will get to one another.": "Billy",
  "Here is the judgment toward which every person outside [of] Christ is headed. The date has already been set by God. All men of all races and nationalities, both past and present, will be there. You may make and break appointments in this life\u2014but this is one appointment you will keep.": "Billy",
  "No personality in history stands above Jesus Christ . . .He alone is able to meet every need of the human race.": "Billy",
  "The human race is called on throughout the Bible to repent of sin and return to God.": "Billy",
  "Salvation is free! God puts no price tag on the Gift of gifts.": "Billy",
  "Our lives are to be characterized by patience, for it is important in developing the mature, stable character which God wants to produce in His people.": "Billy",
  "Salvation is not just repairing the original self. It is a new self created of God in righteousness and true holiness.": "Billy",
  "[God] holds in His omnipotent hand the priceless, precious, eternal gift of salvation, and He bids you to take it without money and without price.": "Billy",
  "Is it not arrogance or narrow-mindedness to claim that there is only one way of salvation or that the way we follow is the right way? I think not. After all, do we fault a pilot for being narrow-minded when he follows the instrument panel [while] landing in a rainstorm? No, we want him to remain narrowly focused!": "Billy",
  "Man stands on the brink of hell. The forces building up in our world are so overwhelming that man everywhere is beginning to cry out in desperation: \u201cWhat must I do to be saved?": "Billy",
  "Millions today want salvation, but on their own terms. They want to come their own way, and so we have hundreds of schemes and plans devised by men to regain paradise.": "Billy",
  "Man has rejected the revelation of the Bible concerning the true and living God of his fathers, and he has substituted gods of his own making. In actuality modern man has decided to dethrone God and enthrone himself in all of his nuclear glory.": "Billy",
  "Pride comes from looking only at ourselves": "meekness",
  "There may have been a time when pride was the very center of your life. You had ambitious thoughts of yourself, your powers, desires, and aims; but now that will begin to change . . . you have been born again.": "Billy",
  "Pride consists not in wanting to be rich, but in wanting to be richer than your neighbor. It is not in wanting to be noticed but in wanting to be the most noticed. It is not in wanting to have things but in wanting more things than others.": "Billy",
  "The destructive power of pride is that it countenances nothing higher than itself. Because of an inherent fault in our nature, man\u2019s bias is on the side of error. In our willful desire to live independently of God, we have severed the lifeline that flows from the source of all life.": "Billy",
  "We must not build up ourselves at the expense of others.": "Billy",
  "Pride always puts [self] above others\u2014and cuts [itself] off from them as a result. No one likes an arrogant, prideful person.": "Billy",
  "Pride flees when we compare ourselves to God instead of [to] other people.": "Billy",
  "One of the ironies of human nature is that it often has a way of rejecting the best and accepting the worst.": "Billy",
  "Acknowledge that there is a defect in human nature, a built-in waywardness that comes from man\u2019s rebellion against God.": "Billy",
  "Man is a rebel, and a rebel is naturally in confusion. He is in conflict with every other rebel. For a rebel by his very nature is selfish. He is seeking his own good and not the good of others.": "Billy",
  "Some people have said that man has improved . . . [and] that if Christ came back today, He would not be crucified but would be given a glorious reception. Christ does come to us every day in the form of Bibles that we do not read, in the form of churches that we do not attend, in the form of human need that we pass by. I am convinced that if Christ came back today, He would be crucified more quickly than He was two thousand years ago. Sin never improves. Human nature has not changed.": "Billy",
  "The deepest problems of the human race are spiritual in nature. They are rooted in man\u2019s refusal to seek God\u2019s way for his life. The problem is the human heart, which God alone can change.": "Billy",
  "Flesh is the Bible\u2019s word for unperfected human nature. Leaving off the \u201ch\u201d and spelling it in reverse, we have the word self. Flesh is the self-life: it is what we are when we are left to our own devices.": "Billy",
  "Man\u2019s nature and destiny are revealed in the Scriptures.": "Billy",
  "Science, they say, can tap the brain of man and alter his desires. But the Bible, which has withstood the ravages of time . . . says that we are possessed of a sinful, fallen nature which wars against us.": "Billy",
  "Our worldly wisdom has made us calloused and hard. Our natural wisdom, as the Scriptures teach, comes not from God, but is earthly, sensual, and devilish.": "Billy",
  "In taking our human nature upon Himself, [Jesus] showed us what we might become, what God intended us to be.": "Billy",
  "Man cannot control himself, and if he will not be controlled by Jesus Christ, then he will be controlled by Satan.": "Billy",
  "You cannot argue with [Satan], for he is the greatest debater of all time.": "Billy",
  "The devil is alive and kicking. But if you are in Christ and follow the rules of daily Bible study, prayer, and witnessing, he has no power over you.": "Billy",
  "Satan is the illusive manipulator. He prances and dances and drinks in the adulation of his worshippers as he glimmers and shimmers, displaying all that glitters and all that attracts the shallowness of man.": "Billy",
  "Satan is masterful at using just enough of God\u2019s truth to capture a person\u2019s attention and then mix it with his devious potion that will lead [believers] astray.": "Billy",
  "Satan is both a fashion designer and an interior designer. He first appeals to the eye and then shouts, \u201cGotcha!\u201d Then he goes to work on the \u201cinside job.": "Billy",
  "The architect of popular culture is none other than Satan. He is the chief designer and chief marketer, and he has been branding worldliness since the beginning of time. His methods are shifty and constantly in motion, changing fads and trends to keep the world running in circles, trying to keep up with the latest and greatest.": "Billy",
  "If you don\u2019t take your stand for Christ, you will be on the wrong side, and someday when it is too late, you\u2019ll cry out, \u201cI\u2019ve taken the wrong stand!\u201d You\u2019ll be in the devil\u2019s trap! You can\u2019t lick the devil.": "Billy",
  "If your heart is not attuned to God, it will become a catch basin for every device of the devil. Yes, Satan is at work in our world. The Bible is my authority.": "Billy",
  "Satan is real and is opposed to everything God is doing.": "Billy",
  "The cross was designed to defeat Satan, who by deception had obtained squatters\u2019 rights to the title of the earth.": "Billy",
  "Satan didn\u2019t lose any of his beguiling ways when he became the fallen prince. He took his charm, his subtleties, and his clever plots to use on us.": "Billy",
  "Satan exalted himself above God and endeavored to get man to doubt the reliability of God\u2019s Word.": "Billy",
  "Satan is the master of the ultimate double-talk and sophistry. He calls evil good and continues to confuse men with his cleverly disguised untruths.": "Billy",
  "Satan perverts everything good by mimicking and mocking the real thing.": "Billy",
  "Never forget: Satan\u2019s goal is to turn us away from God.": "Billy",
  "[Satan] will create a religion without a Redeemer. He will build a church without a Christ. He will call for worship without the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Your eyes should never be lent to the devil": "they",
  "The mind is the devil\u2019s favorite avenue of attack.": "Billy",
  "I have yet to see Satan overcome a truly joyful Christian.": "Billy",
  "Before Satan there was no sin, and before sin there was no pain.": "Billy",
  "Since the Bible is God\u2019s Word, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised if Satan tries to convince us otherwise.": "Billy",
  "We are living in a topsy-turvy world, where all is confusion. But you may be sure that it is confusion with a plan\u2014Satan\u2019s plan!": "Billy",
  "Never forget: Death was Satan\u2019s greatest victory.": "Billy",
  "Satan will thrash about in one last burst of evil,hoping to capture as many souls as possible before his inevitable end.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that Satan is the author of sin. Sin is the reason we have afflictions, including death. All of our problems and our suffering are a result of man\u2019s rebellionagainst God. But God has provided a rescue in His Son.": "Billy",
  "We have two natures within us, both struggling for mastery. Which one will dominate us? It depends on which one we feed.": "Billy",
  "We are to feed the new nature on the Word of God constantly, and we are to starve the old nature, which craves the world and the flesh. We are told to \u201cmake not provision for the flesh\u201d [Romans 13:14 KJV].": "Billy",
  "The greatest need in the world is the transformation of human nature. We need a new heart that will not have lust and greed and hate in it. We need a heart filled with love and peace and joy, and that is why Jesus came into the world.": "Billy",
  "Men cannot help that it is their nature to respond to the lewd, the salacious, and the vile. They will have difficulty doing otherwise until they are born again.": "Billy",
  "In John 6 we read that when great multitudes went after Him, He told them three times that unless they were willing to pay the price, they could not be His followers.": "Billy",
  "[Jesus] asked [His followers] to count the cost carefully, lest they should turn back when they met with suffering and privation. He told His followers that the world would hate them.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t be deceived by Satan and his lies. Instead, stay close to Christ\u2014because the closer you are to Him, the farther away you are from the devil.": "Billy",
  "Christ warned His followers that to believe in Him would not make them popular, and that they should be prepared to face affliction for His sake.": "Billy",
  "If [Christian leaders] do not teach Christian principles to all followers of Christ, we are not equipping them with God\u2019s truth that willovercome worldly influence.": "Billy",
  "Following Christ has been made too easy. It is easy to follow Him when our world is safe and comfortable . . .but when that world shatters, only a secure faith will sustain us.": "Billy",
  "Learn to keep close to [Jesus], to listen to His voice, and follow Him.": "Billy",
  "By faith in [Jesus] we can be forgiven of our sins and know the joy of following Him every day.": "Billy",
  "The men who followed Jesus were unique in their generation. They turned the world upside down because their hearts had been turned right side up.": "Billy",
  "The same Book that tells us over and over again of God\u2019s love warns us constantly of the devil who would come between us and God, the devil who is ever waiting to ensnare men\u2019s souls.": "Billy",
  "The devil is the god of this world and he has blinded our eyes.": "Billy",
  "Satan wants to lure us into his traps, and he knows exactly what kind of \u201cbait\u201d will appeal to us. He knows what we\u2019re like, and he will attack us exactly where we are the weakest.": "Billy",
  "Satan will do everything he can to divide Christians and destroy our witness. Only the Holy Spirit can subdue our old nature and overcome it with God\u2019s love.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t give Satan a foothold, but discipline yourself to stay close to God. He alone is your security.": "Billy",
  "Satan rejoices when old habits overwhelm [us] and we cave in to the pressure of the crowd . . .perhaps temptation lures [us] into sin . . .a backsliding Christian compromises their faith and causes unbelievers to mock the Gospel.": "Billy",
  "[Christians] are called to distinguish themselves as Christ followers, not community organizers.": "Billy",
  "The devil and his demons really do believe in God\u2014and why wouldn\u2019t they? They understand that they are engaged in a cosmic battle of titanic proportions, and they know they are up against the Creator of the universe\u2014a truth that makes them shudder. There are no atheists in hell!": "Billy",
  "When our minds are on Christ, Satan has little room to maneuver.": "Billy",
  "The greatest roadblock to Satan\u2019s work is the Christian who, above all else, lives for God, walks with integrity, is filled with the Spirit, and is obedient to God\u2019s truth.": "Billy",
  "The greatest hindrance to Satan\u2019s destructive efforts is our standing strong in the knowledge and fear of the Lord.": "Billy",
  "Satan rejoices when we are inconsistent, because he knows that an inconsistent Christian is an ineffective Christian\u2014or worse.": "Billy",
  "We constantly pass up the rich and beautiful and ennobling experiences and seek out the tawdry, the cheap, and the degrading. These are the works of the devil, and they flourish on every side!": "Billy",
  "The devil is a master at making us question God and His Word. Twisting Scripture . . . taking a verse out of context . . .deceiving us into thinking God is mean-spirited\u2014these are some of Satan\u2019s favorite tricks.": "Billy",
  "Satan does not care how much you theorize about Christianity or how much you profess to know Christ. What he opposes vigorously is the way you live Christ.": "Billy",
  "We must be constantly aware that Satan can take any human effort and twist it to serve his own purposes.": "Billy",
  "Only God can thwart the plans of Satan and his legions.": "Billy",
  "If you are not careful you will find yourself actually in the employ of the devil. He is powerful, slick, crafty, wily, and subtle.": "Billy",
  "One of the devil\u2019s methods is to attack everyone . . . He knows that the Word of God is powerful, and he will try to keep you from it.": "Billy",
  "When we are filled with the Spirit of God, obeying God, in His will and quoting Scripture, Satan will be defeated.": "Billy",
  "Jesus did not dispute [Satan] . . . our Lord quoted Scripture, and that\u2019s one thing the devil can\u2019t stand! The Scripture defeats him every time.": "Billy",
  "Fear can paralyze us and keep us from believing God and stepping out in faith. The devil loves a fearful Christian!": "Billy",
  "We have seen moral and religious leaders,men who claim to be followers of Jesus,fall into disgrace in the eyes of God and man, and worst of all we have seen the Gospel of Jesus Christ and twisted and distorted it by false teachers to accommodate the destructive morals and secular behavior of these times.": "Billy",
  "As long as Satan is loose in the world and our hearts are dominated by his evil passions, it will never be easy or popular to be a follower of Christ.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s followers need to know the truth He sets forth in His Word so that we can confidently discern between His truth and Satan\u2019s lies.": "Billy",
  "Salvation is free, but there is a price to pay in following Jesus. It is never said in Scripture that we can have \u201cChrist and . . .\u201d.It is always \u201cChrist or . . .\u201d. What is your \u201cor\u201d?": "Billy",
  "God\u2014the Bible\u2019s Author\u2014loves you and wants you to be His child through faith in Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Faith is loved and honored by God more than any other single thing.": "Billy",
  "Your faith may be just a little thread. It may be small and weak, but act on that faith. It does not matter how big your faith is, but rather, where your faith is.": "Billy",
  "Jesus Himself was the first missionary . . .He pledged His followers to be missionaries too!": "Billy",
  "The happiest people I know are separated followers of Jesus Christ.They are not dependent on artificial stimulants. They do not resort to sick, dirty jokes. They do not abuse their bodies to relax their minds.": "Billy",
  "Faith implies four things: self-renunciation, reliance with utter confidence on Christ, obedience, and a changed life.": "Billy",
  "When our faith becomes nothing more than a series of rules and regulations, joy flees and our love for Christ grows cold.": "Billy",
  "If our faith isn\u2019t rooted in the Bible, it will wither like a plant pulled out of the soil.": "Billy",
  "Fear can banish faith, but faith can banish fear.": "Billy",
  "Do you want your faith to grow? Then let the Bible begin to saturate your mind and soul.": "Billy",
  "Faith literally means \u201cto give up, surrender, or commit.\u201d Faith is complete confidence.": "Billy",
  "Faith in Christ is voluntary. A person cannot be coerced, bribed, or tricked into trusting Jesus. God will not force His way into your life. The Holy Spirit will do everything possible to disturb you, draw you, love you\u2014but finally it is your personal decision.": "Billy",
  "Happy is the person who has learned the secret of being content with whatever life brings him, and has learned to rejoice in thesimple and beautiful things around him.": "Billy",
  "Do you really want happiness? Then you will have to pay the price of humbling yourself at the foot of the cross and receiving Christ as Savior.": "Billy",
  "Happiness is a choice, but grief is a certainty.": "Billy",
  "Christ said there is a happiness in that acknowledgement of spiritual poverty which lets God come into our souls.": "Billy",
  "It is the presence of sin that prevents man from being truly happy.": "Billy",
  "The mourning of inadequacy is a weeping that catches the attention of God . . .The happiest day of my life was when I realized that my own ability, my own goodness, my own morality was insufficient in the sight of God; and I publicly and openly acknowledged my need of Christ.": "Billy",
  "We say, \u201cHappy are the clever, for they shall inherit the admiration of their friends\u201d; \u201cHappy are the aggressive, for they shall inherit a career\u201d; \u201cHappy are the rich, for they shall inherit a world of friendsand a house full of modern gadgets.\u201d Jesus said, \u201c[Happy] are the meek; for they shallinherit the earth\u201d [see Matthew 5:5]. If we want the secret of happiness . . .\"meekness\u201d is a basic key.": "Billy",
  "My wife and I were invited to have lunch with one of the wealthiest men in the world. He was seventy-five years old. Tears came down his cheeks. \u201cI am the most miserable man in the world,\u201d he said. I have everything anyone could ever want. If I want to go anywhere, I have my own yacht or private plane. But down inside I\u2019m miserable and empty.\u201d Shortly after, I met another man who preached in a small church nearby. He was vivacious and full of life, and he told us, \u201cI don\u2019t have a penny to my name, but I\u2019m the happiest man in the world!": "Billy",
  "The Bible lists in Hebrews 11 the heroes of the faith . . .who were tortured, imprisoned, stoned, torn apart, and killed by the sword. They didn\u2019t wear designer jeans but went about in animal skins, destitute and tormented.": "Billy",
  "There is no room for God\u2019s Word in our culture, where our children are without reverence for God or faith in the Bible. There is no room for our Lord\u2019s creed of purity and self-denial when the media sends forth a constant barrage of profanity and indecency and materialism.": "Billy",
  "Discouragement is the opposite of faith. It is Satan\u2019s device to thwart the work of God in your life.": "Billy",
  "[The] inability to comprehend fully the mysteries of God does not in any way curtail the Christian faith. On the contrary, it enhances our belief. We do not understand the intricate pattern of the stars in their courses, but we know that He who created them does, and that just as surely as He guides them, He is charting a safe course for us.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that faith will manifest itself in three ways. It will manifest itself in doctrine\u2014in what you believe. It will manifest itself in worship\u2014your communion with God . . .It will manifest itself in morality\u2014in the way you live and behave.": "Billy",
  "Christians who are strong in the faith grow as they accept whatever God allows to enter their lives.": "Billy",
  "I have never been to the North Pole, and yet I believe there is a North Pole. How do I know? I know because somebody told me. I read about it in a history book, I saw a map in a geography book, and I believe the men who wrote those books. I accept it by faith. The Bible says, \u201cFaith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God\u201d [Romans 10:17 KJV].": "Billy",
  "Our faith can stand up to any question, but sometimes people ask questions\u2014and keep asking questions\u2014just to avoid facing their own spiritual needs and acknowledging who Jesus really is.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t forget: Without fuel, a fire grows cold\u2014and without the \u201cfuel\u201d of the Bible, prayer, and Christian fellowship, our faith grows cold.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that faith is the only approach that we have to God. No man has sins forgiven, no man goes to heaven, no man has assurance of peace and happiness, until he has faith in Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Faith isn\u2019t pretending our problems don\u2019t exist, nor is it simply blind optimism. Faith points us beyond our problems to the hope we have in Christ.": "Billy",
  "Evangelism is not a calling reserved exclusively for the clergy. I believe one of the greatest priorities of the church today is to mobilize the laity to do the work of evangelism.": "Billy",
  "Philip is the only person in the Bible who was called an evangelist, and he was a deacon!": "Billy",
  "He who is called to and set apart for the work of an evangelist is to devote his time and effort single-mindedly to this God-given task. He is not to be distracted by anything likely to deflect him from this. Persecution will not weaken his resolution. The persuasion of others will fall on deaf ears. Only the clear leading of God will cause him to change his ministry.": "Billy",
  "No clergyman however brilliant, no evangelist no matter how eloquent or compelling, can bring about the revival we need. Only the Holy Spirit can do this.": "Billy",
  "The evangelistic ministry is a fight, not a frolic.": "Billy",
  "The great crowds themselves are meaningless. The thing that counts is what happens in the hearts of the people. The evangelist sows the seed, and much inevitably falls upon stony ground and bears no fruit. But if only a few seeds flourish, the results are manifold.": "Billy",
  "Evangelism has always been the heartbeat for our ministry": "it",
  "Evangelism is more than simply encouraging decisions for Christ. It is urging people to become disciples\u2014followers\u2014of Jesus Christ. As such, the evangelist has a responsibility to make growth in discipleship possible for those who come to faith under his ministry.": "Billy",
  "This is still the age of grace. God\u2019s offer of forgiveness and a new life still stands. However, the door will one day be closed. Someday it will be too late. This is why the Bible continually warns and challenges: \u201cNow is the accepted time\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:2 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "When you pick up the cross of unpopularity, wherever you may be, you will find God\u2019s grace is there, more than sufficient to meet your every need.": "Billy",
  "Some of the most radiant Christians I have ever met were \u201cwheelchair\u201d saints. May God give you grace to \u201ctriumph in affliction.": "Billy",
  "We are living in an age of grace, in which God promises that \u201cwhosoever will\u201d may come and receive His Son. But this period of grace will not go on indefinitely. We are even now living on borrowed time.": "Billy",
  "Only as we bow in contrition, confession, and repentance at the foot of the cross, can we find forgiveness. There is the grace of God!": "Billy",
  "The motive of grace is the infinite, compassionate love of a merciful God, but the work of grace was the death of Christ on the cross.": "Billy",
  "The grace of God has been tested in the crucible of human experience, and has been found to be more than an equal for the problems and sins of humanity.": "Billy",
  "Throughout Scripture we read of warnings preceding disaster. Such alerts from God are part of His grace and provision.": "Billy",
  "Christ did not suffer and die to offer cheap grace. Jesus did not willingly go to the cross so we could have an easy life or offer a faith built on easy-believism. As someone said, \u201cSalvation is free, but not cheap.\u201d It cost Jesus His life.": "Billy",
  "I look forward to seeing Christ and bowing before Him in praise and gratitude for all He has done for us, and for using me on this earth by His grace\u2014just as I am.": "Billy",
  "Envy and greed always\u2014always\u2014exact a terrible price. I have never met an envious or greedy person who was at peace.": "Billy",
  "The Bible warns us against greed and selfishness, it does encourage frugality and thrift.": "Billy",
  "The Bible sees greed as a form of idolatry, because a greedy person worships things instead of God. Greed and envy have their roots in selfishness.": "Billy",
  "Envy and greed starve on a steady diet of thanksgiving.": "Billy",
  "Everything that we see about us that we count is our possessions only comprises a loan from God, and it is when we lose sight of this all-pervading truth that we become greedy and covetous.": "Billy",
  "Life is not a matter of dollars and cents, houses and lands, earning capacity and financial achievement. Greed must not be allowed to make man the slave of wealth.": "Billy",
  "What is the authority in your life? Is it your selfishness? Your lust? Your greed? Or have you turned it all over to God and said, \u201cLord, You are going to be my authority\u201d? When you are under authority, you are then able to assume authority.": "Billy",
  "We have seen the results of unrestrained greed, corruption, and manipulation on Wall Street, financial mismanagement in the halls of government, fraud and perversion at the highest levels of both church and state. Many people sense the possibility of an even greater unraveling in the world. We are constantly confronted by the realities of new problems in this age of crisis.": "Billy",
  "It is not wrong to want to work and earn a decent living; in fact, God has given work to us. But this legitimate desire can very easily cross the line into greed\u2014especially in our materialistic society.": "Billy",
  "Greed is an unreasonable or all-absorbing desire to acquire things or wealth. One test of greed is that it is never satisfied. Greed is repeatedly condemned in the Bible.": "Billy",
  "We need to be on guard against greed . . . above all we need to make sure our lives are centered in Christ and not things.": "Billy",
  "Exercise and proper eating habits are very important, since the Bible says that the body is God\u2019s holy temple, but I don\u2019t think that superbodies equate with committed Christian discipleship. Some of the greatest saints I\u2019ve known have been those with physical infirmities.": "Billy",
  "Let us always remember that Christ calls men and women not only to trust Him as Savior, but also to follow Him as Lord. That call to discipleship must be part of our message if we are to be faithful to Him.": "Billy",
  "To be a disciple is to be committed to Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord and committed to following Him every day. To be a disciple is also to be disciplined in our bodies, minds, and souls.": "Billy",
  "Our minds must be set always to seek the will of the Lord. Following the progressive discipline revealed through the Bible will result in a walk of obedience to God.": "Billy",
  "God does not discipline us to subdue us but to condition us for a life of usefulness and blessedness. In His wisdom, He knows that an uncontrolled life is an unhappy life, so He puts reins on our wayward souls that they may be directed into the paths of righteousness.": "Billy",
  "It is no accident that the words discipline and disciple resemble each other in the English language. The most common word in the Gospels for a Christian is disciple.": "Billy",
  "Christ never told his disciples that they would get an Academy Award for their performances, but He did tell them to expect to have troubles.": "Billy",
  "Jesus Christ spoke frankly to His disciples concerning the future . . .In unmistakable language He told them that discipleship means a life of self-denial, and the bearing of a cross.": "Billy",
  "Many Christians want the benefits of their belief, but they hesitate at the cost of discipleship.": "Billy",
  "To be a disciple of Jesus means to learn from Him, to follow Him. The cost may be high.": "Billy",
  "We are commissioned to make disciples, to bring them into the same direct relationship with Christ as those who left their nets and their fishing boats to become \u201cfishers of men.": "Billy",
  "An evangelist is like a newscaster on television or a journalist writing for a newspaper . . . except that the evangelist\u2019s mission is to tell the Good News that never changes.": "Billy",
  "During all my years as an evangelist,my message has always been the Gospel of Christ.It is not a Western religion, nor is it a message of one culture or political system . , .it is a message of life and hope for all the world.": "Billy",
  "God called me many years ago to be an evangelist, and I have never regretted His leading. I love the crusades, meeting people from every country and culture all over the world. My life has been blessed by friends from every land, and challenges from every corner.": "Billy",
  "Itinerant evangelists are the most important ambassadors and messengers on earth. They are a mighty army, spreading out across the world with a vision to reach their own people for Christ.": "Billy",
  "Some evangelists spend too much time thinking and even planning about how to achieve visible results. This is an easy trap to fall into.": "Billy",
  "Nowhere do the Scriptures tell us to seek results, nor do the Scriptures rebuke evangelists if the results are meager.": "Billy",
  "The evangelist cannot bring conviction of sin, righteousness, or judgment; that is the Spirit\u2019s work. They cannot convert anyone; that is the Spirit\u2019s work.": "Billy",
  "The Bible opens with a tragedy and ends in a triumph.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is God\u2019s love letter to us.": "Billy",
  "The whole world ought to know the story of the Bible.": "Billy",
  "When you are told that science has disproved the Bible, ask specifically where such is the case. True science and a true understanding of the Bible are never at variance.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is a living Book and can be trusted for its advice and direction and knowledge of God.": "Billy",
  "[God] speaks from heaven through the Bible, His written Word. This is why I use the phrase \u201cthe Bible says.\u201d I would not have the authority to say what I do in sermons unless it was based upon the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "We should read the Bible expectantly, systematically, and obediently . . .The Bible can change our lives as we read it and obey its teachings every day.": "Billy",
  "God has spoken to us through a Book: the Bible.": "Billy",
  "No book ever takes the place of the Bible. It is its own best commentary.": "Billy",
  "Most of us do not understand nuclear fission, but we accept it . . . Why is it so easy to accept manmade miracles and so difficult to accept the miracles of the Bible?": "Billy",
  "The Bible is God\u2019s gift to us. It came from God, and it points us to God.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is a guidebook, leading men [and women] to God in a personal faith. Like a map or guidebook, it will show you the way, but you must take it one step at a time.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is to your soul what bread is to your body. You need it daily. One good meal does not suffice for a lifetime.": "Billy",
  "I\u2019m afraid most Bibles remain unopened and unread. Don\u2019t let this be true of yours!": "Billy",
  "The vitality [of] the Bible [is] exhibited in every generation . . .Its power to transform lives is its best apologetic.": "Billy",
  "There is nothing which indicates the inspiration of the Scriptures more than the factual and faithful record of men and their failures . . .These records are for our warning and instruction. They show us how sinful man needs God.": "Billy",
  "Just as the Bible is God\u2019s written Word, so Jesus is God\u2019s living Word.": "Billy",
  "One can approach the Bible with a cold, rationalistic attitude, or one can do so with reverence and the desire to hear God speak.": "Billy",
  "I do not understand why reading the Bible in public should make others feel uncomfortable . . . it may be such an example that serves to remind them of the Book they have neglected.": "Billy",
  "The [Bible\u2019s] message is concerned with earth dwellers, their origin, the reason for their existence, the cause of their misery, and the plan of redemption for a fallen race.": "Billy",
  "We are not free to pick and choose the parts of the Bible we want to believe or obey. God has given us all of it, and we should be obedient to all of it.": "Billy",
  "Psalms teaches us how to relate to God, and Proverbs teaches us how to relate to others.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is our authority in everything it touches. This means the Bible is our guide to show us how to live . . . it is our instructor.": "Billy",
  "The Bible has stood the test of time because it is divinely inspired by Almighty God, written in ink that cannot be erased by any man, religion,or belief system.": "Billy",
  "The Word does not change. The Dead Sea scrolls, archeology, modern science\u2014they do not change the Bible; they confirm it.": "Billy",
  "Man has not changed. Man still rejects the testimony of the Scripture.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t take your Bible for granted! For centuries ordinary believers had no access to the Bible; Bibles had to be painstakingly copied by hand and were very expensive. The only access most people had to the Bible was by hearing it read in church. The invention of the printing press changed all that, however, and today the Bible is readily available in multiple translations and hundreds of languages around the world.": "Billy",
  "Every generation has found [the Bible\u2019s] message indispensable, and its influence on individuals and society over the centuries has been enormous.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s laws for the spiritual world are found in the Bible. Whatever else there may be that tells us of God, it is more clearly told in the Bible.": "Billy",
  "The Bible will always be the center of controversy.": "Billy",
  "The only place we can find a clear, i unmistakable message is in the Word of God [the Bible].": "Billy",
  "We should begin the day with the Bible, and as it comes to a close let the Word speak its wisdom to our souls. Let it be the Staff of Life upon which our spirit is nourished. Let it be the Sword of the Spirit which cuts away the evil of our lives and fashions us in His image and likeness.": "Billy",
  "The central theme of the Bible is salvation, and the central personality of the Bible is Christ.": "Billy",
  "In the Bible God speaks to us": "in",
  "The Bible is to be our basis of authority. We must \u201cby faith\u201d accept [Jesus] as the Son of the living God. This sounds narrow and intolerant, and in a sense it is!": "Billy",
  "People from all walks of life are searching for answers to life\u2019s problems. I believe the Bible has the answer to man\u2019s deepest needs.": "Billy",
  "The main \u201cfood\u201d God has given to strengthen us is the Bible, the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Each of us has our reference point and as a Christian the reference point by which I measure my life and thought is the Bible.": "Billy",
  "I don\u2019t think people can live without hope. What oxygen is to the lungs, hope is to our survival in this world. And the Bible is filled with hope.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is not an option": "it",
  "The Bible is the constant fountain for faith, conduct, and inspiration from which we drink daily.": "Billy",
  "God gave the Bible to us because He wants us to know Him and love Him and serve Him. Most of all, He gave it to us so we can become more like Christ.": "Billy",
  "Some of the strongest warnings about judgment in the Bible come from the lips of Jesus.": "Billy",
  "Man is precisely what the Bible says he is. Human nature is behaving exactly as the Bible said it would. The course of human events is flowing just as Christ predicted.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that man\u2019s chief problem is spiritual.": "Billy",
  "In the textbook of revelation, the Bible, God has spoken verbally; and this spoken word has survived every scratch of the human pen.": "Billy",
  "The Bible . . . is the only Book that offers man a redemption and points the way out of his dilemmas. It is our one sure guide in an unsure world.": "Billy",
  "We have become a nation of biblical illiterates.": "Billy",
  "When we approach the Bible as history and biography, we approach the Bible in the wrong spirit. We must read the Bible, not primarily as historians seeking information, but as men and women seeking God.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is the textbook of revelation.In God\u2019s great classroom there are three textbooks\u2014one called nature, one called conscience, and one named Scripture. In the written textbook of revelation\u2014the Bible\u2014God speaks through words.": "Billy",
  "Without the Bible, this world would indeed be a dark and frightening place, without signpost or beacon.": "Billy",
  "Those who read the Scriptures as magnificent literature, breath-taking poetry, or history and overlook the story of salvation miss the Bible\u2019s real meaning and message.": "Billy",
  "As we cast our frightened eyes around for something that is real and true and enduring, we are turning once more to this ancient Book [the Bible] that has given consolation, comfort, and salvation to millions in the centuries past.": "Billy",
  "God never leads us to do anything that is contrary to the Bible.": "Billy",
  "The Bible stands as the supreme Constitution for all mankind, its laws applying equally to all who live under its domain, without exception or special interpretation.": "Billy",
  "The Bible can stand the onslaught of any enemy.": "Billy",
  "I have yet to discover a source of information, practical advice, and hope that compares to the wisdom found in the Bible.": "Billy",
  "As the Constitution is the highest law of the land [in America], so the Bible is the highest law of God. For it is in the Bible that God sets forth His spiritual laws. It is in the Bible that God makes His enduring promises. It is in the Bible that God reveals the plan of redemption for the human race.": "Billy",
  "Become grounded in the Bible. As Christians, we have only one authority, one compass: the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "The words of this Book have a way of filling in the missing pieces, of bridging the gaps, of turning the tarnished colors of our life to jewel-like brilliance. Learn to take your every problem to the Bible. Within its pages you will find the correct answer.": "Billy",
  "Before you \u201cre-think\u201d your faith, it may be wise to examine the critics of the Bible. In the end your faith will be even stronger.": "Billy",
  "Make use of this tool of communication by which God speaks to us\u2014namely, the Bible! Read it, study it, memorize it. It will change your entire life. It is not like any other book. It is a \u201cliving\u201d book that works its way into your heart, mind, and soul.": "Billy",
  "I find something new in the Bible every time I read it . . . that can be the experience of everyone who comes to it wanting to discover more of God\u2019s truth.": "Billy",
  "The Pilgrims . . . put their ideals ahead of all material considerations. It is not surprising that the Pilgrims had little and succeeded, while we have much and are in danger of failing. No civilization can make progress unless some great principle is generously mixed into the mortar of its foundations in life.": "Billy",
  "The Pilgrims had vision and hope because they lived in the dimension of eternity. Their strength of spirit was forged by a personal faith in God, by tough discipline, and by regular habits of devotion.": "Billy",
  "Our nation grew strong in an era when moral standards were emphasized, and it will grow weak when we condone that which we once condemned.": "Billy",
  "The nation\u2019s image has become more like a chameleon\u2014accepting whatever trend marketers concoct. Gone are the days of reverencing a holy God in the church or within ourselves. Yet the Bible tells us, \u201cHappy is the man who is always reverent\u201d (Proverbs 28:14 NKJV).": "Billy",
  "What I find disturbing in America is the consuming desire for leisure, convenience, and fun. It seems we, as a nation, have traded God for gadgets. We have traded eternal truth for momentary self-gratification\u2014worshipping false gods of materialism and humanism instead of the Creator of all things.": "Billy",
  "As long as we are on this earth, we possess dual citizenship. On one hand we owe allegiance to our nation and are called to be good citizens. But we are also citizens of the kingdom of God. Our supreme loyalty is to Him.": "Billy",
  "All the nations that make up the world are burdened down with riches or poverty, obesity or malnutrition, success or failure.": "Billy",
  "At the bitter end of an era of liberation\u2014women\u2019s lib, kids\u2019 lib, animal lib, and everything-but-ethics lib\u2014America has apparently been liberated from its moral foundations. But for too many, the good life has become a living hell.": "Billy",
  "The great flaw in the American economic system has finally been revealed: an unrealistic faith in the power of prosperity rather than in the ultimate power and benevolence of God.": "Billy",
  "The American Dream became America\u2019s god": "wealth",
  "No matter how hard we try, words simply cannot express the horror, the shock, and the revulsion we all feel over what took place in this nation on 9/11.

  "The blood of Christ \u201cpurchased men for God from every tribe and language and people and nation\u201d (Revelation 5:9 NIV).": "Billy",
  "People reading the Bible for the first time are often surprised to discover how much human drama it contains. Almost every conceivable human dilemma and conflict is reflected in its pages.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is the only Book in the world that predicts the future. The Bible is more modern than tomorrow morning\u2019s newspaper.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is God\u2019s book of promises, and, unlike the books of men, it does not change or get out of date.": "Billy",
  "Let the study of the Bible become central in your life\u2014not just so you will know it, but that you will obey it.": "Billy",
  "The sword of the Spirit\u2014the Bible\u2014is the weapon God has provided for us to use in this battle between truth and deception. Make it a priority to wield that sword skillfully.": "Billy",
  "[The Bible] has survived attack of every kind. Neither barbaric vandalism nor civilized scholarship has touched it. Neither the burning of fire nor the laughter of skepticism has accomplished its annihilation. Through the many dark ages of man, its glorious promises have survived unchanged.": "Billy",
  "I learned the importance of the Bible and came to believe with all my heart in its full inspiration. It became a sword in my hand to break open the hearts of men, to direct them to the Lord Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "It is man and not the Bible that needs correcting. Greater and more careful scholarship has shown that apparent contradictions were caused by incorrect translations, rather than divine inconsistencies.": "Billy",
  "Today there are more people who know the words to a television commercial than know the words in the Bible.": "Billy",
  "Every graveyard and every cemetery testify that the Bible is true.": "Billy",

  "Discover the Bible for yourself.": "Billy",
  "If I stick to the Bible and preach the principles and the teachings of the Bible, and quote the Bible, it has an impact of its own.": "Billy",
  "We can trust the Bible because it points us to the most important events in human history: the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "From one end of the Bible to the other, God assures us that He will never go back on His promises.": "Billy",
  "Come back to the Bible. Begin to read it. Study it and God will speak to you and change you\u2014and through you perhaps history can be changed.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is actually a library of books\u2014some long, some short\u2014written over hundreds of years by many authors. Behind each one, however, was [the] Author: the Spirit of God.": "Billy",
  "We have so many battles going on in America today that we should be a people of prayer. Our government needs prayer. Our leaders need prayer. Our schools need prayer. Our youth need our prayers. Our families need our prayers.": "Billy",
  "America\u2019s Declaration of Independence speaks of \u201cthe pursuit of happiness,\u201d but nowhere in the Bible are we told to pursue this. Happiness is elusive, and we don\u2019t find it by seeking it.": "Billy",
  "Just as America has grown and prospered within the framework of our Constitution, so Christianity has flourished and spread according to the laws set forth in the Bible.": "Billy",
  "[God] alone is perfect. Even His anger is righteous, because it is directed solely against evil.": "Billy",
  "Every destructive emotion bears its own harvest, but anger\u2019s fruit is the most bitter of all.": "Billy",
  "Can we overcome our anger, instead of constantly being overcome by it? Yes\u2014with God\u2019s help. Peter\u2019s anger was channeled into boldness for Christ. Paul\u2019s anger against Christians was replaced with a burning passion to spread the Gospel. Is this your goal?": "Billy",
  "Anger flees when the Spirit\u2019s fruit fills our hearts.": "Billy",
  "On the cross Christ took upon Himself every sin we\u2019ve ever committed\u2014including anger.": "Billy",
  "If you have been harboring anger or bitterness or jealousy in your heart toward someone\u2014a parent, an ex-spouse, a boss\u2014hand it over to Christ, and ask Him to help you let it go.": "Billy",
  "There are many irritations in life. They become prime opportunities for Satan to lead us into evil passion. Keep anger clear of bitterness, spite, or hatred.": "Billy",
  "Anger makes us lash out at others, destroying relationships and revealing our true nature. The history of the human race is largely the history of its anger.": "Billy",
  "Bitterness is anger gone sour, an attitude of deep discontent that poisons our souls and destroys our peace.": "Billy",
  "We get angry when others hurt us, both by what they say and what they do. We get angry when we don\u2019t get our own way or our plans and dreams are frustrated. Anger may arise in an instant, erupting like a volcano and raining destruction on everyone in sight. Often, anger simmers just below the surface, sometimes for a lifetime. Like a corrosive acid, this kind of anger eats away at our bodies and souls, yet we may not even be aware of its presence.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t let the acids of bitterness eat away inside. Learn the secret of trusting Christ in every circumstance.": "Billy",
  "America has probably been the most successful experiment in history. The American Dream was a glorious attempt. It was built on a religious foundation. Its earliest concepts came from Holy Scripture.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t let hatred control you, no matter what others do that causes [anger]. You would only become guilty of the same sin that afflicts them, and nothing would be solved.": "Billy",
  "When someone hurts us, our natural instinct is to strike back\u2014but when we do, we not only destroy any possibility of reconciliation, but we also allow anger and hate to control us.": "Billy",
  "You can put a public school and university in the middle of every block of every city in America\u2014but you will never keep America from rotting morally by mere intellectual education.": "Billy",
  "I believe America has gone a long way down the wrong road. If we ever needed God\u2019s help, it is now.": "Billy",
  "God honored and blessed America as few nations in history. However, in recent years the nation has been moving away from its religious heritage.": "Billy",
  "We must face honestly the toll that anger and bitterness take on our lives. They are our enemies! The Bible says, \u201cAn angry person stirs up dissension, and a hot-tempered one commits many sins.": "Billy",
  "America is said to have the highest per capita boredom of any spot on earth! We know that because we have the greatest variety and greatest number of artificial amusements of any country. People have become so empty that they can\u2019t even entertain themselves.": "Billy",
  "A terrifying spiritual and moral tide of evil has already loosed us from our spiritual moorings. Monstrous new ideas that could easily destroy our freedoms are rushing into the vacuum.": "Billy",
  "Nations rise, they flourish for a time, and then they decline. Eventually every empire comes to an end; not even the greatest can last forever.": "Billy",
  "There is no doubt that nations come to an end when they have ceased to fulfill the function that God meant for them.": "Billy",
  "The secret strength of a nation is found in the faith that abides in the hearts and homes of the country.": "Billy",
  "We talk out of both corners of our mouth at once. We say we are a Christian nation, but much of our literature, our social practices, our deep interests are not Christian at all. They are totally secular.": "Billy",
  "Spiritually, we have wandered far from the faith of our fathers . . . no nation which relegates the Bible to the background, which disregards the love of God and flouts the claims of the Man of Galilee, can long survive.": "Billy",
  "No form of government has been able to establish righteousness, justice, and peace, the three elements without which we can never have continued national prosperity or international peace.": "Billy",
  "Our government is certainly going to fall like a rope of sand if unsupported by the moral fabric of God\u2019s Word. The moral structure in our country grew from Judeo-Christian roots. When those values are applied, they produce moral fruits. But if that structure disappears, the moral sentiment that shapes our nation\u2019s goals will disappear with it.": "Billy",
  "We face dangers every day of which we are not even aware. Often God intervenes on our behalf through the use of His angels.": "Billy",
  "God isn\u2019t finished with you when you retire! When we know Christ, we never retire from His service.": "Billy",
  "Among young people . . . drinking is for getting drunk. And many go on to become alcoholics.": "Billy",
  "Drunkenness is not a new vice. Its ravages have always been a scourge on the human race . . .Alcohol is a killer, a murderer.": "Billy",
  "Thousands are killed and injured every year by teenagers driving too fast or under the influence of drugs and drink . . .others are killing [themselves] with alcohol or heroin overdoses.": "Billy",
  "In Christ alone there is deliverance from man\u2019s tortured thoughts and freedom from the sordid habits which are destroying so many people. Why does the Bible so clearly denounce drunkenness? Because it is an enemy of human life. Anything that is against a person\u2019s welfare, God is against.": "Billy",
  "Do not seek solace in alcohol. Alcohol obscures good judgment and leaves you unable to think clearly or understand what God is trying to say to you.": "Billy",
  "What began as an apparently harmless pastime has ended up as a frightening, overpowering addiction or obsession.": "Billy",
  "Some [young people] are taking pills called \u201cheaven or hell\u201d drugs, because you\u2019re liable to experience either one.": "Billy",
  "Drinking and other forms of body-wrecking pleasures are signs of weakness rather than manliness. It takes a better man to live a clean life\u2014free from the stimulants, depressants, and drugs\u2014than to be artificially [stimulated].": "Billy",
  "The cult of self has become an addiction\u2014feeding off the ego of self-glorification. The word cult encompasses many movements and ideas, but simply put, it describes a culture of alternative beliefs, fads, and trends, and tampers with just enough truth to knock many off balance.": "Billy",
  "There is hope for the alcoholic: God is able to deliver from this as well as any other addiction.": "Billy",
  "Old age has its compensations. More than ever I see each day as a gift from God. It is also a time to reflect back on God\u2019s goodness over the years and an opportunity to assure others that God truly is faithful to His promises.": "Billy",
  "Many people plan financially for retirement\u2014but not spiritually and emotionally.": "Billy",
  "Old age is Satan\u2019s last chance to blow us off course.": "Billy",
  "One of the characteristics of some drugs (such as cocaine) is that they make a person feel strong and alert\u2014when in fact the opposite is the case. Don\u2019t allow yourself to be deceived.": "Billy",
  "God wants us to work (whether at home or on the job), but that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s wrong to retire. The Levites (who assisted in Israel\u2019s worship) were required to retire at fifty.": "Billy",
  "Ask [God] to help you reflect Christ as you grow older, instead of turning sour or grumpy.": "Billy",
  "Life can grow sweeter and more rewarding as we grow older if we possess the presence of Christ. Sunsets are always glorious. It is Christ who adds colors, glory, and beauty to man\u2019s sunsets.": "Billy",
  "Life has its share of joys and laughter\u2014but we also know life\u2019s road is often very rough. Temptations assail us; people disappoint us; illness and age weaken us; tragedies and sorrows ambush us; evil and injustice overpower us. Life is hard\u2014but God is good, and heaven is real!": "Billy",
  "I believe in angels because the Bible says there are angels": "and",
  "Many people are trying to steady themselves by taking tranquilizers. Jesus is the greatest tranquilizer of all. He can straighten out your life and put you back on center.": "Billy",
  "Some people seem to put the devil on a par with God. Actually, Satan is a fallen angel.": "Billy",
  "[Angels] guide, comfort, and provide for the people of God in the midst of suffering and persecution.": "Billy",
  "The empire of angels is as vast as God\u2019s creation. If you believe the Bible, you will believe in their ministry.": "Billy",
  "Whether or not we sense and feel the presence of the Holy Spirit or one of the holy angels, by faith we are certain God will never leave us or forsake us.": "Billy",
  "[Angels] crisscross the Old and New Testaments, being mentioned directly or indirectly nearly 300 times.": "Billy",
  "Just as millions of angels participated in the dazzling show when the morning stars sang together at creation, so will the innumerable hosts of heaven help bring to pass God\u2019s prophetic declarations throughout time and into eternity.": "Billy",
  "Anger and bitterness\u2014whatever the cause\u2014only end up hurting us. Turn that anger over to Christ.": "Billy",
  "[God] wants to help you overcome the bitterness and anger that you feel, and He wants to encourage you . . . He knows that anger and depression will never help you deal with your problems\u2014they only make them worse.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s will is for us to commit our lives to Christ and follow Him. God\u2019s will also is that we avoid sin.": "Billy",
  "Do you want to know what God\u2019s will is for you? It is for you to become more and more like Christ. This is spiritual maturity, and if you make this your goal, it will change your life.": "Billy",
  "Sometimes it\u2019s best to start moving in the direction you think God may want you to go, and then trust Him to lead you\u2014closing doors He doesn\u2019t want you to go through and opening up others.": "Billy",
  "Each generation becomes more addicted to the sedatives of life, to dull the pain of living.": "Billy",
  "The greatest barrier to knowing God\u2019s will is simply that we want to run our own lives. Our problem is that a battle is going on in our hearts\u2014a battle between our wills and God\u2019s will.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s will is that we would be righteous in our living. God is holy, and the whole scheme of redemption has holiness for its goal.": "Billy",
  "God wants us to know His will and He reveals it to us both through the Bible and through the guidance of His Holy Spirit. Seek God\u2019s will when you pray, and He will help you know it.": "Billy",
  "The Bible condemns the use of any substance which alters or distorts our thinking (including alcohol, which was the most common drug in ancient times).": "Billy",
  "To know the will of God is the highest of all wisdom. Living in the center of God\u2019s will rules out all falseness of religion and puts the stamp of true sincerity upon our service to God.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s holiness demands that sin be punished\u2014but God\u2019s love has provided the way of redemption through Christ.": "Billy",
  "God will never\u2014never\u2014lead you to do something that is contrary to His written Word, the Bible.": "Billy",
  "Living the Christian life means striving for holiness.": "Billy",
  "When that glorious day comes, sin and death will be destroyed and Satan will be banished. All the strife and hatred and suffering and death that twist and scar this world will vanish, and the Lord\u2019s Prayer will be fulfilled: God\u2019s will will be done on earth as it is in heaven.": "Billy",
  "Some of the most heart-breaking letters I receive are from people who tell how alcohol or drugs have ravaged their lives and destroyed their families.": "Billy",
  "We cannot be satisfied with our goodness after beholding the holiness of God.": "Billy",
  "If you are ignorant of God\u2019s Word, you will always be ignorant of God\u2019s will.": "Billy",
  "When the headlines get black and foreboding, the sale of alcohol and barbiturates rises in the country, as millions try to escape from the grim realities of [such] dangers.": "Billy",
  "Many people turn to alcohol to try to drown the [cries] and longings of the soul. Others attempt to quiet the longings of their souls in other ways. Nothing but God ever completely satisfies, because the soul is made for God.": "Billy",
  "Some years ago I was invited to be on a television talk show with one of the most famous personalities in America. Afterward she took me aside and told of the emptiness in her life. \u201cMy beauty is gone,\u201d she said, \u201cI am getting old, I\u2019m living on alcohol, and I have nothing to live for.": "Billy",
  "One of the most conspicuous modes of escape is alcoholism, which is now a national catastrophe.": "Billy",
  "This self-confident generation has produced more alcoholics, more drug addicts, more criminals, more wars, more broken homes, more assaults, more embezzlements, more murders, and more suicides . . .it is time all of us . . . begin to take stock of our failures, blunders, and costly mistakes. It is about time that we place less confidence in ourselves and more trust and faith in God.": "Billy",
  "Escapism seems to be the order of the day . . .Escape with drugs or alcohol, and the bitterness of living will be blurred . . .We can\u2019t escape from God.": "Billy",
  "Researchers have found that peer pressure exerted within a clique has caused every one of its members to experiment with drugs, to engage in murderous gang fights, to steal autos, and to violate the seventh commandment.": "Billy",
  "Liquor is not necessary either for health or for so-called gracious living . . .It is the cause of untold sorrow, suffering, and material loss, not to mention the spiritual implications of drinking.": "Billy",
  "Drunkenness. This Greek word means overindulgence in alcohol. Alcohol may be used for medicine, but it can also become a terrible drug. The way it is used in our world is probably one of the great evils of our day. It is a self-inflicted impediment that springs from \u201ca man taking a drink, a drink taking a drink, and drink taking the man.\u201dDistilled liquors as we have them today were unknown in Bible times.12": "Billy",
  "In Houston, Texas, a man was born again in one of our meetings. He owned a liquor store. The next morning he had a sign on the front of his door saying, \u201cOut of business.": "Billy",
  "Drinking has become one of the most serious social problems. It is basically the result of an attempt to escape from the responsibilities and realities of life.": "Billy",
  "A senator once confided to me that the greatest need in Washington was the elimination of the cocktail party. He said: \u201cIt consumes so much of our time that we don\u2019t have time for matters of state.": "Billy",
  "Volumes could be written on the problem of [drug] addiction. Millions of barbiturates are swallowed every night to help the nation sleep. Millions of tranquilizers keep us calm during the day. Millions of pep pills wake us up in the morning. The Bible warns that these flights from reality bring no lasting satisfaction.": "Billy",
  "The Greek word used in the New Testament to designate a sorcerer or a person who practiced occult magic is \u201cpharmakeus,\u201d or one who mixed drugs and used them to induce spells . . .Such practices are included in the list of \u201cacts of the sinful nature\u201d in Galatians 5:19\u201321 that God will judge.": "Billy",
  "One of the bonuses of being a Christian is the glorious hope that extends out beyond the grave into the glory of God\u2019s tomorrow.": "Billy",
  "We are so caught up with the affairs of this life we give little attention to eternity.": "Billy",
  "What you do with Christ here and now decides where you shall spend eternity.": "Billy",
  "We glorify Christ when we live for God\u2014trusting, loving, and obeying Him.": "Billy",
  "When one bears suffering faithfully, God is glorified and honored.": "Billy",
  "What greater glory can we anticipate than to stand before the throne of God, to humble ourselves before His great and incomparable majesty.": "Billy",
  "Prayer serves a dual purpose": "the",
  "Our voices, our service, and our abilities are to be employed, primarily, for the glory of God.": "Billy",
  "One of the joys of heaven . . . will be discovering the hidden ways that God in His sovereignty acted in our lives on earth to protect and guide us [that we might] bring glory to His name, in spite of our frailty.": "Billy",
  "Our dress, our posture, our actions should all be for the honor and glory of Christ. Much of our talk as Christians is secular, not spiritual. It is easy to fall into the conversational conformity of the world and spend an evening discussing politics, new cars, and the latest entertainment. We often forget that we are to edify one another with holy conversation and that our conversation should be on heavenly, and not exclusively on earthly things.": "Billy",
  "We glorify God by living lives that honor Him.": "Billy",
  "Life is just a schoolroom with a glorious opportunity to prepare us for eternity.": "Billy",
  "Most people are living for today with barely a thought of eternity.": "Billy",
  "How do we prepare for that last day? Before we embark on our final trip, have we left an earthly home in a state of chaos or a condition of order?": "Billy",
  "[Multitudes] have never been born again. They will go into eternity lost\u2014while thinking they are saved because they belong to the church, or were baptized.": "Billy",
  "A Christian funeral should be a coronation ceremony, a statement to the world about eternal life.": "Billy",
  "Where will we spend eternity\u2014with God in that place of endless joy the Bible calls heaven, or apart from Him in that place of endless despair the Bible calls hell?": "Billy",
  "Heaven is real and hell is real, and eternity is but a breath away.": "Billy",
  "God can use the fear that grips the hearts of men today to point them to eternal truths\u2014the truth of God\u2019s eternal judgment, and the truth of His eternal love.": "Billy",
  "Jesus taught that there is an eternal destiny for each individual\u2014either heaven or hell (John 5:25\u201329). The eternal destiny of each individual depends on a decision made in this life (Luke 16:19\u201331)\u2014to be followed by a life of obedience.": "Billy",
  "Christians should seek after holiness\u2014without which no man shall see the Lord. Let us seek ardently the kind of life that reflects the beauty of Jesus and marks us as being what saints ought to be!": "Billy",
  "What stirs God most is not physical suffering but sin. All too often we are more afraid of physical pain than of moral wrong. The cross is the standing evidence of the fact that holiness is a principle for which God would die.": "Billy",
  "As I read the Bible, I seem to find holiness to be [Christ\u2019s] supreme attribute.": "Billy",
  "If you belong to Jesus Christ, you are called to live a life of purity and holiness. God wants your mind to be shaped by Him so that your thoughts and goals reflect Christ.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t take the holiness of God lightly, for it is the very essence of His character.": "Billy",
  "Compassion is not complete in itself, but must be accompanied by inflexible justice and wrath against sin and a desire for holiness.": "Billy",
  "We do not fail to enjoy the fruit of the Spirit because we live in a sea of corruption": "we",
  "Disappointment and failure are not signs that God has forsaken you or stopped loving you. The devil wants you to believe God no longer loves you, but it isn\u2019t true. God\u2019s love for us never fails.": "Billy",
  "[While] disappointment and failure aren\u2019t identical, they often occur together, and both can hold us back from God\u2019s best for our lives.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t be bound by the past and its failures. But don\u2019t forget its lessons either.": "Billy",
  "Repeated disappointment almost always triggers a series of other reactions: discouragement, anger, frustration, bitterness, resentment, even depression. Unless we learn to deal with disappointment, it will rob us of joy and poison our souls.": "Billy",
  "Pride is associated with failure, not success. We hear a great deal about the inferiority complex, but the superiority complex of pride is seldom spoken of . . .The greatest act of humility . . .was when Jesus Christ stooped to die on the cross of Calvary.": "Billy",
  "I long to see [Jesus] face to face, to hear His voice and touch Him. In the day I go to be with Him, there will be no unfulfilled longings or disappointments. He will welcome me into His mansion, answer my questions, and teach me the wisdom of the ages.": "Billy",
  "Disappointments are part of life; we can\u2019t always have our own way, and we need to learn to separate what is significant from what is merely annoying. Only in heaven will we be free of all disappointments and failures. A friend of mine says, \u201cOh well, a hundred years from now it won\u2019t make any difference!": "Billy",
  "Learn from your disappointments and failures and with God\u2019s help seek to overcome them. Ask yourself, could I have done anything to prevent this? Were my hopes and dreams unrealistic, or were my motives wrong?Is there a new path God wants me to explore?": "Billy",
  "The time to prepare for life\u2019s disappointments and hurts is in advance.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t let failure or disappointment cut you off from God or make you think the future is hopeless. When God closes one door, He often opens another\u2014if we seek it.": "Billy",
  "If we who have the Holy Spirit living and working within us falter and fail, what hope is there for the rest of the world?": "Billy",
  "Many of the mysteries of God\u2014the heartaches, trials, disappointments, tragedies, and the silence of God in the midst of suffering\u2014will be revealed in heaven.": "Billy",
  "Peter preached about [the blood]. Paul wrote about it, and the redeemed in heaven sing about it. In a sense, the New Testament is the Book of the Blood.": "Billy",
  "How often do we lie simply because we are trying to build ourselves up in the eyes of others? How often do we gossip because we want to appear \u201cin the know,\u201dor because we are trying to make ourselves appear better than someone else? The Bible's command is clear: [\u201cHave regard for good things in the sight of all men\u201d (Romans 12:17 NKJV)].": "Billy",
  "Renewal is brought by the Holy Spirit. Believers will learn what it means to minister to one another and build each other up. No longer will our lives seem ordinary and indistinguishable from the rest of the world.": "Billy",
  "Sometimes we encourage someone without even being aware of it. Even the example we set by attending church may encourage someone who is searching for God.": "Billy",
  "[The Holy Spirit] will remain with every believer right to the end. This thought has encouraged me a thousand times in these dark days when satanic forces are at work.": "Billy",
  "With an old head and a young heart, you can be a source of real strength [to others] who need your cheer and encouragement.": "Billy",
  "All around you are people whose lives are filled with trouble and sorrow, and they need your compassion and encouragement.": "Billy",
  "We never gain in life by hurting others. Sometimes we try to elevate our own insecure egos by degrading and belittling those around us. Yet this produces only a false sense of self-esteem.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches us to be more concerned about the needs and feelings of others than our own. We are to encourage and build self-confidence in our loved ones, friends, and associates.": "Billy",
  "The journey God has set before us isn\u2019t a freeway; we are constantly encountering forks and junctions and crossroads. Which way will we go when we meet them? Life is filled with decisions, and we can\u2019t avoid them.": "Billy",
  "Jesus does not allow us to be neutral about Him. Jesus demands that we decide about Him.": "Billy",
  "God has a plan and the devil has a plan, and you will have to decide which plan you are going to fit into.": "Billy",
  "Men and women do make decisions wherever the Gospel is proclaimed; whether publicly or privately, some say yes, some say no, and some procrastinate. No one ever hears the Gospel proclaimed without making some kind of decision!": "Billy",
  "When disappointment or tragedy or suffering strikes, we have a decision to make: Will we turn away from God, or will we turn toward Him? Which road will we take? One road leads to doubt, anger, bitterness, fear, hopelessness, and despair.The other leads to hope, comfort, peace, strength, and joy.": "Billy",
  "When we are called before God and His throne of judgment, it will be too late to reverse our decision. It is during our lifetime here on earth that we decide our eternal destiny.": "Billy",
  "Becoming \u201cnew\u201d in Christ is a wonderful beginning, but it isn\u2019t the end of pain or problems in our lives. It is the beginning of our facing up to them. Being a Christian involves a lifetime of hard work, dedicated study, and difficult decisions.": "Billy",
  "Part of the human makeup which distinguishes man from other creatures is his ability to reason and make moral decisions. Man is a free moral agent.": "Billy",
  "Once God leads you to make a decision, don\u2019t draw back. Instead, trust His leading, and believe He goes before you\u2014because He does.": "Billy",
  "The most important decision you will ever make is the decision you make about eternity.": "Billy",
  "Some people resist the idea of a choice of any sort. They don\u2019t want to be called \u201cnarrow.\u201d But Jesus taught that there are two roads, and you have to choose which road you will take.": "Billy",
  "There are two masters, and you have to choose which master you are going to serve.": "Billy",
  "There is not a day that we do not have a chance to choose between the devil\u2019s clever promises and God\u2019s sure Word.": "Billy",
  "From the beginning of time until the present moment, man\u2019s ungodly quest for power, his determination to use his gift of free choice for his own selfish ends, has brought him to the brink of doom.": "Billy",
  "Our families cannot choose Christ for us. Our friends cannot do it. God is a great God, but even God can\u2019t make the decision for us . . .we have to make our own choice.": "Billy",
  "[God] created us free to choose how we would live . . . but leaves us free to pursue our own ends with tragic, natural consequences.": "Billy",
  "The Bible clearly teaches that when we turn our backs on God and choose to disregard His moral laws there are inevitable consequences. Furthermore it is not God who is to blame for the consequences, but the person who has broken His law.": "Billy",
  "The Antichrist . . . will be the embodiment of evil, and will have great power to deceive those who choose to follow him.": "Billy",
  "[Our] problems boil down to one of moral choices.God wanted a world based on moral values,thus He created mankind with the ability to respond to moral choices.Faced with the moral option of living selfishly or unselfishly, people can and do make wrong decisions. We are free to choose, but we reap the consequences of bad moral decisions.": "Billy",
  "Ultimately, every human being must face this question: What do you think of Christ? Whose Son is He? We must answer this question with belief and action. We must not only believe something about Jesus, but we must do something about Him. We must accept Him or reject Him.": "Billy",
  "The destiny of your own soul is in your own hands by the choice you make.": "Billy",
  "Have you ever seen a person who was receiving a blood transfusion? The blood was precious, life-giving, and certainly not repulsive. The blood of Christ may seem to be a grim and repulsive subject . . .[but] the blood of Christ is precious.": "Billy",
  "Blood is the symbol of the life sacrificed for sin.": "Billy",
  "Once for all God made complete and perfect provision for the cure of man\u2019s sins; without the blood of Christ, it is indeed a fatal disease.": "Billy",
  "We are called to obey Christ. He is the Master of our lives and has washed us in His blood, which cleanses our souls, our minds, and our mouths. The world is watching. What do they see and hear?": "Billy",
  "To many people, the mention of the blood of Christ is distasteful. However, on [a] visit to Mayo Clinic I noticed that at each reception desk there were pamphlets entitled A Gift of Life, urging people to donate blood.Anyone who has gone through surgery and looked up to seethe bag of blood dripping slowly into his veins,realizes with gratitude the life-giving property of blood.5": "Billy",
  "Blood is mentioned 460 times in the Bible. Fourteen times in the New Testament Jesus spoke of His own blood. Why? Because by the shedding of His blood, He accomplished the possibility of our salvation.": "Billy",
  "The distinctive feature of Christianity is blood atonement. Without it we cannot be saved. Blood is actually a symbol of the death of Christ.": "Billy",
  "[Today] there is less emphasis on redemption by the blood of Christ.": "Billy",
  "Today the idea of the shed blood of Christ is becoming old-fashioned and out of date in a lot of preaching. It is in the Bible. It is the very heart of Christianity.": "Billy",
  "Anxiety and fear are like baby tigers: The more you feed them, the stronger they grow.": "Billy",
  "Look up on a starry night, and you will see the majesty and power of an infinite Creator.": "Billy",
  "Though we have less to worry about than previous generations, we have more worry. Though we have it easier than our forefathers, we have more uneasiness. Though we have less real cause for anxiety than our predecessors, we are inwardly more anxious.": "Billy",
  "Historians will probably call our era \u201cthe age of anxiety.\u201d Anxiety is the natural result when our hopes are centered in anything short of God and His will for us.": "Billy",
  "Hypochondriacs who have a fanciful anxiety about their health will never be well regardless of their physical condition.": "Billy",
  "Is it any wonder that fear and anxiety have become the hallmarks of our age?": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s star promised peace to the whole world . . .too often man\u2019s synthetic stars bring fear and anxiety. Our gadget-filled paradise, suspended in a hell of international insecurity, certainly does not offer us the happiness of which the last century dreamed. But there is still a star in the sky.": "Billy",
  "No situation is beyond God\u2019s control. Over my wife\u2019s desk are these words: \u201cFear not the future": "God",
  "Men and women who give [Christ] first place find that there is no need for anxiety about this world\u2019s goods.": "Billy",
  "A professor at the University of Michigan said to me: \u201cAs soon as we create life in a test tube, we won\u2019t need God anymore.\u201d I answered: \u201cThis happened once before when man ruled God out and proposed the Tower of Babel. It ended in frustration, confusion, and judgment.": "Billy",
  "The Bible is the one book which reveals the Creator to the creature He created! No other book that man has conceived can make that statement and support it with fact.": "Billy",
  "Have we just been placed here by some unknown creator or force without any clue as to where we came from, why we are here, and where we are going? The answer is \u201cno.\u201d We do have a code. We do have a key . . . the Bible.": "Billy",
  "The only one who can re-create us is the One who created us in the first place. If your watch were out of order, you wouldn\u2019t take it to a blacksmith. If your car needed overhauling, you wouldn\u2019t go to a machine shop. Our spiritual problems can be solved only by the God who created us originally.": "Billy",
  "As a Christian, I believe that we are all created in the image of God. I believe that God loves the whole world . . .The life of no human being is cheap in the eyes of God, nor can it be in our own eyes.": "Billy",
  "There is no conclusive scientific evidence that man is \u201cup from the ape.\u201d While the animals were created \u201cafter their kind,\u201d we are told that \u201cGod created man in His own image\u201d [Genesis 1:27 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "There is no point of space, whether inside or outside the bounds of creation, where God is not present. That is why when we ask the question, \u201cWho\u2019s in control?\u201d we can answer without equivocation, \u201cGod is!": "Billy",
  "Any theory of the universe that does not take into account the God and Creator of the universe is not worthy of serious consideration.": "Billy",
  "God is the Ruler of His mighty creation. There is no reason to despair, because He holds in His hands the whole world, while His Spirit is able to fill the void in man\u2019s heart.": "Billy",
  "[God] has in mind a picture of what He intends to create. He breaks, cracks, chisels, and polishes until one day there emerges His vision . . . God has not yet finished with us.": "Billy",
  "By faith I accepted Him for what He claimed to be, the Son of the Living God. That simple decision changed my life\u2014and I have seen it change the lives of countless others across the world.": "Billy",
  "When my decision for Christ was made . . . I knelt in prayer. I opened my heart and knew for the first time the sweetness and joy of God, of truly being born again . . .I knew in my heart that I was somehow different and changed. That night absolutely changed the direction of my life.": "Billy",
  "Deep down inside I knew something was different . . .I wanted to tell others what had happened to me. I didn\u2019t have any tears, I didn\u2019t have any emotion, I didn\u2019t hear any thunder, there was no lightning . . . but . . . I made my decision for Christ.": "Billy",
  "You need to make the right decision\u2014firmly and decisively\u2014and then stick with it with God\u2019s help.": "Billy",
  "Conscience is our wisest counselor and teacher, our most faithful and most patient friend.": "Billy",
  "You will never know the peace with God, peace of conscience, peace of mind, and peace of soul until you stand at the foot of the cross and identify yourself with Christ by faith . . . this is peace with God.": "Billy",
  "Christ can rid you of inner conflict. Man without God is always torn between two urges. His nature prompts him to do wrong, and his conscience urges him to do right.": "Billy",
  "In your own mind-darkened, will-paralyzed, conscience-dulled soul, God can make the light penetrate and turn the darkness of your own life into day, if you will let Him.": "Billy",
  "We\u2019ve tried calling sin \u201cerrors\u201d or mistakes\u201d or \u201cpoor judgment,\u201d but sin itself has stayed the same. No matter how we try to salve our conscience, we\u2019ve known all along that men are still sinners; and the results of sin are still disease, disappointment, disillusionment, despair, and death.": "Billy",
  "Conscience tells us in our innermost being of the presence of God and of the moral difference between good and evil; but this is a fragmentary message, in no way as distinct and comprehensive as the lessons of the Bible.": "Billy",
  "Many a criminal has finally given himself over to the authorities because the accusations of a guilty conscience were worse than prison bars.": "Billy",
  "Dishonesty is never justified. God will never approve, and even your own conscience will rise up to condemn you sooner or later.": "Billy",
  "The human conscience is often beyond the grasp of a psychiatrist . . .Humans are helpless to detach themselves from the gnawing guilt of a heart bowed down with the weight of sin. But where humans have failed, God has succeeded.": "Billy",
  "The human conscience is reliable only when it is guided by the Holy Spirit.": "Billy",
  "Some Christians have an elastic conscience when it comes to their own foibles\u2014and an ironbound conscience when it comes to the foibles of others.": "Billy",
  "Sin also affects the conscience, until one becomes slow to detect the approach of sin.": "Billy",
  "There are storms in your own life: storms oftemptation, confusion, and difficulty . . .An uneasy conscience says, \u201cStop before it is too late!": "Billy",
  "As a person finds God\u2019s will for his or her life, matters of conscience can be handled with perception from the Holy Spirit.": "Billy",
  "From a cleansed conscience emerges a changed life.": "Billy",
  "The one and only choice by which you can be converted is your choice to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ as your own personal Lord and Savior. The word \u201cconversion\u201d means simply \u201cturning.": "Billy",
  "In every true conversion the will of man comes into line with the will of God.": "Billy",
  "True conversion will involve the mind, the affection, and the will. There have been thousands of people who have been intellectually converted to Christ . . .but they have never been really converted to Him.": "Billy",
  "The converted person will love the good he once hated, and hate the sin he once loved.": "Billy",
  "To be a Christian is not a pious pose. It is not a long list of restrictions. Christianity flings open the windows to the real joy of living. Those who have been truly converted to Jesus Christ know the meaning of abundant living.": "Billy",
  "In order to get to heaven, Jesus said that you must be converted. I didn\u2019t say it\u2014Jesus said it!": "Billy",
  "There are thousands of people who have had some form of emotional experience that they refer to as conversion but who have never been truly converted to Christ. Christ demands a change in the way you live\u2014and if your life does not conform to your experience, then you have every reason to doubt your experience!": "Billy",
  "It is a comfort to hear the words of God in times of stress.": "Billy",
  "God doesn\u2019t comfort us to make us comfortable, but to make us comforters.": "Billy",
  "We should go to no place that we would not go in His Presence. But He is not with us just to judge or condemn us; He is near to comfort, protect, guide, encourage, strengthen, cleanse, and help.": "Billy",
  "There are countless opportunities to comfort others, not only in the loss of a loved one, but also in the daily distress that so often creeps into our lives.": "Billy",
  "Because tragedy happened to you, it gives you a greater sense of oneness with others who experience tragedy. Because we have been comforted through the Word of God, we in turn may be able to comfort others.": "Billy",
  "When we are a comfort and encouragement to others, we are sometimes surprised at how it comes back to us many times over.": "Billy",
  "Humanity wants comfort in its sorrow, light in its darkness, peace in its turmoil, rest in its weariness, and healing in its sickness and diseases: The Gospel gives all of this to us.": "Billy",
  "If the church is acceptable to this present ageand is not suffering reproach, then it is not the true church that our Lord founded.": "Billy",
  "The church should not reflect pop culture but portray godly attributes. The church should not seek pleasures but seek after God.": "Billy",
  "The church is blending into the community by embracing what the world enjoys and, in turn, bringing inside the church the world\u2019s ideas and interests.": "Billy",
  "Christ\u2019s church is a place to grow people up in the Lord, not to enhance our leisure time.": "Billy",
  "Church is not for pretenders and performers. Church is a place for pastors to preach principles of the faith in order to prepare believers to face the storms of life on the stage of an unbelieving world.": "Billy",
  "The church is in turmoil today. The church is not to reflect the world but to be a portrait of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "No church is perfect, but don\u2019t let that discourage you. Someone has said that if you ever find one that is, it will stop being perfect the minute you join!": "Billy",
  "The church should not be pampered but rather prepare for, and expect, persecution\u2014for it is Christ\u2019s body on earth.": "Billy",
  "We have become so tolerant and accepting of the world\u2019s ways that it is hard for many in the church to notice the sin much less answer how it crept in. The church is to be in the world, but worldliness is not to infiltrate the church.": "Billy",
  "When the church begins to entertain the flock and respond to the cult of self\u2014it is diminished to a mere community center.": "Billy",
  "The fiercest storm is taking place in some of our churches\u2014the unbelief and disobedience of God\u2019s Word.": "Billy",
  "In our desire to make Christ known and to increase the influence of the church, we are many times prone to think that Christians and the church can be made popular with the unbelieving world. This is a grave mistake on the part of the church.": "Billy",
  "It is vitally important for local church leaders to keep in touch with the spiritual state of their members, to discuss their level of biblical knowledge, and to teach them how to study God\u2019s Word and pray.": "Billy",
  "The church is far greater than [a building or denomination]. It includes the whole family of God\u2014that vast unseen fellowship of men and women throughout the ages who belong to Christ. Paul wrote of \u201cGod\u2019s household, which is the church of the living God\u201d [1 Timothy 3:15 NIV).": "Billy",
  "God speaks to us through our conscience. This may be a \u201cstill small voice\u201d that will not let us go until we do what we know is right . . .we must never silence that inner voice\u2014[but] check what we think it is saying against the Scriptures.": "Billy",
  "Conscience is the detective that watches the direction of our steps and decries every conscious transgression.": "Billy",
  "Conscience is a vigilant eye before which each imagination, thought, and act is held up for either censure or approval . . .There is no greater proof of the existence of a moral law and Lawgiver in the universe than this little light of the soul. It is God\u2019s voice to the inner man.": "Billy",
  "Do not be content to skim through a chapter [of the Bible] merely to satisfy your conscience. Hide the Word of God in your heart.": "Billy",
  "God does communicate with those who are willing to obey Him. He penetrates the dark silence with free, life-giving discoveries in nature, the human conscience, Scripture, and the Person of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Sometimes it is difficult to differentiate the Christian from the man of the world. In America, for example, churchgoing has become popular, but churchgoing may not necessarily be accompanied by genuine depth in prayer and Bible study or a change in lifestyle.": "Billy",
  "Satan] invades the Sunday school, the Bible class, and even the pulpit. He even invades the church under cover of an orthodox vocabulary, emptying sacred terms of their biblical sense.": "Billy",
  "I am afraid the church is trying to speak out on too many issues that really do not concern the church. There are certain issues we know to be wrong\u2014racial injustice, crime, gambling, dishonesty, pornography. On these matters we must thunder forth as the prophets of God.": "Billy",
  "In some churches today and on some religious television programs, we see the attempt to make Christianity popular and pleasant. We have taken the cross away and substituted cushions.": "Billy",
  "In thousands of churches [people] are led astray theologically. Thus spiritually and morally they are drifting aimlessly, without compass or guide.": "Billy",
  "The church in America has been deeply infiltrated by the \u201cworld,\u201d and in the process it is beginning to copy and resemble the world in many of its activities.": "Billy",
  "Preaching the whole council of God involves man\u2019s environment and physical being as well as his soul. There is no doubt that the church is in danger of getting off the main track and getting lost.": "Billy",
  "God did not ordain that the church should drift aimlessly in the seas of uncertainty without compass, captain, or crew.": "Billy",
  "The church should be setting the pace. The church should be taking its proper place of leadership in the nation . . .God help the church to wake up!": "Billy",
  "The church holds the key to revival. It is within our grasp.": "Billy",
  "America and Western Europe are on a moneymaking, pleasure-mad spree unparalleled in the history of the world. God is generally ignored or ridiculed. Church members in many cases are only halfhearted Christians. Judgment is coming.": "Billy",
  "We have been trying to solve every ill of society as though society were made up of regenerate men to whom we had an obligationto speak with Christian advice.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s church is a Bible-centered church, and it grows strong under persecution.": "Billy",
  "Before three thousand people were brought into the church on the day of Pentecost, the disciples had spent fifty days in prayer, fasting, and spiritual travail.": "Billy",
  "The Bible nowhere teaches that the church will ultimately convert the whole world to Jesus Christ. There has never been a generation in history, nor will there ever be generation, in which the majority of the people will believe in Christ.": "Billy",
  "Thousands of people have entered churches without discovering a vital experience with Jesus Christ. The substitutes have been handed them in the guise of religious rituals, good works, community effort, or social reform . . .none of which can gain a person a right relationship with God.": "Billy",
  "There will come a time when people hungering for the truth will seek it where it is supposedly disseminated, such as books and churches, but they will not hear the Word of the Lord. Instead of receiving a message to satisfy their spiritual longings, they will hear a sermon on some current political or social problem, or a sermonette on art and literature. And so they wander from one place to another, going from hope to despair, and eventually giving up.": "Billy",
  "Unless the church quickly recovers the authoritative biblical message, we may witness the spectacle of millions of Christians going outside the institutional church to find spiritual food.": "Billy",
  "What right does any church have even attempting to approve of lifestyles or certain acts for which God prescribed the death penalty in the Old Testament?": "Billy",
  "There are many who sit in some churches week after week, year after year, without hearing the whole Gospel and knowing what it is to be born again. They hear a gospel which is incomplete, and consequently not good news at all.": "Billy",
  "Statistics indicate that the church is rapidly losing in the population explosion. There are fewer Christians per capita every day.": "Billy",
  "The church has lost its ability to discipline members who live openly in sin. Consequently, we have lost our witness in the community.": "Billy",
  "The church is a storehouse of spiritual food whereby the inner man is fed, nourished, and developed into maturity. If it fails, it is not fulfilling its purpose as a church.": "Billy",
  "It could be said that going to church will not make one a Christian. But . . . refusing to fellowship with believers will not make you one either.": "Billy",
  "I hope the day will never come when the church abandons the \u201cclass meeting\u201d and the prayer service . . .The old-fashioned \u201ctestimony\u201d meeting should be revived, for through this medium we can share with others our faith and triumphs as well as our needs and mistakes.": "Billy",
  "Down through the centuries the church has contributed more than any other single agency in lifting social standards to new heights.": "Billy",
  "The church isn\u2019t just a particular building or congregation but the spiritual fellowship of all who belong to Jesus Christ. If we belong to Christ, we also belong to each other.": "Billy",
  "Many churches have molded their programs around the community\u2014not the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "The Lord did not design the church to cater to people\u2019s needs\u2014the Lord breathed life into the church to proclaim His truths.": "Billy",
  "The church does not prey on the lost": "it",
  "It is unbelief that shuts the door to heaven and opens it to hell. It is unbelief that rejects the Word of God and refuses Christ as Savior. It is unbelief that causes men to turn a deaf ear to the Gospel.": "Billy",
  "The subject of heaven is much easier to accept than the subject of hell. And yet the Bible teaches both.": "Billy",
  "Not one word about hell in the Bible would ever make you want to go there.": "Billy",
  "I am conscious of the fact that the subject of hell is not a very pleasant one. It is very unpopular, controversial, and misunderstood . . .As a minister I must deal with it. I cannot ignore it.": "Billy",
  "Among those Christians to whom hell means little, Calvary means less.": "Billy",
  "Will a loving God send a man to hell? The answer from Jesus and His teachings of the Bible is, clearly, \u201cYes!\u201d He does not send man willingly, but man condemns himself to eternal hell because . . .he refuses God\u2019s way of salvation and the hope of eternal life with Him.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches there is hell for every person who willingly and knowingly rejects Christ as Lord and Savior. Many passages could be quoted to support that fact.": "Billy",
  "Hell has been cloaked in folklore and disguised in fiction for so long, many people deny the reality of such a place.": "Billy",
  "Some teach \u201cuniversalism\u201d\u2014that eventually everybody will be saved and the God of love will never send anyone to hell. They believe the words \u201ceternal\u201d or \u201ceverlasting\u201d do not actually mean forever. However, the same word which speaks of eternal banishment from God is also used for the eternity of heaven.": "Billy",
  "A seminary professor I once knew told his students, \u201cNever preach about hell without tears in your eyes.": "Billy",
  "I would not change places with the wealthiest and most influential person in the world. I would rather be a child of the King, a joint-heir with Christ, a member of the Royal Family of heaven!": "Billy",
  "Your life is intricately woven into the lives of scores and hundreds of others around you. Consider the variety of lives that you influence in one day. Somewhere within your circle of contacts someone is being hurt. Are you aware of it?": "Billy",
  "Apart from religious influence, the family is the most important unit of society.": "Billy",
  "God will never lead contrary to His word\u2014so get acquainted with the Word of God, the Bible. Pray. He leads through the illumination of the Holy Spirit in our hearts. Use whatever you have and be faithful. We are called to serve Christ in our sphere of influence.": "Billy",
  "It doesn\u2019t take great wealth or social influence to be faithful, but it does take obedience and endurance.": "Billy",
  "The way in which we react to hurts and disappointments influences the shaping of our personalities.": "Billy",
  "Salt and light speak of the influence Christians can exercise for good in society.": "Billy",
  "We must understand what the word believe implies. It means \u201ccommit\u201d and \u201csurrender.": "Billy",
  "We can hold nothing back [from God]. He must control and dominate us [wholly]. It is a surrender without any conditions attached. This surrender is a definite and conscious act on our part in obedience to the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "There is not one verse of Scripture that indicates you can be a Christian and live any kind of a life you want to. When Christ enters into the human heart, He expects to be Lord and Master. He commands complete surrender.": "Billy",
  "Faith actually means surrender and commitment to the claims of Christ. It means an acknowledgment of sin and a turning to Christ.": "Billy",
  "Jesus expects one hundred percent surrender, and when that is accomplished He rewards a thousandfold.": "Billy",
  "Surrendering to Christ is like signing your name to a blank check and letting the Lord put in the amount.": "Billy",
  "In our spiritual pilgrimage we see sins which mar our relationship with God, but beneath it is a commitment which seeks to move beyond to a higher life, based on wholehearted surrender to God.": "Billy",
  "Pentecost was the day of power of the Holy Spirit. It was the day the Christian church was born.": "Billy",
  "The word church as applied to the Christian society was first used by Jesus Himself when He told Peter, \u201cUpon this rock I will build my church\u201d [Matthew 16:18]. He is the foundation of all Christian experience.": "Billy",
  "The blood of the martyrs is the seed of the church.": "Tertullian",
  "The blood of Christ purchased the church.": "Billy",
  "If we in the church want a cause to fight, let\u2019s fight sin. Let\u2019s reveal its hideousness. Let\u2019s show that Jeremiah was correct when e said: \u201cThe heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked\u201d [Jeremiah 17:9 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "I am convinced if the church went back to the main task of proclaiming the Gospel it would see people being converted to Christ, and it would have a far greater impact on the social, moral, and psychological needs of people than anything else it could possibly do.": "Billy",
  "I have met men who are habitual liars. They have lied so long that they no longer can distinguish between the truth and a lie. Their sensitivity to sin has been almost completely deadened.": "Billy",
  "Movie and television stars lay down the law offashions, manners, speech, and even moral behavior. It has been proven that a movie or a television program can brainwash.": "Billy",
  "New morality is nothing more than the old immorality brought up to date.": "Billy",
  "Truth is timeless. Truth does not differ from one age to another, from one people to another, from one geographical location to another . . . the great all-prevailing Truth stands for time and eternity.": "Billy",
  "Because truth is unpopular does not mean that it should not be proclaimed.": "Billy",
  "Our emotions can lie to us, and we need to counter our emotions with truth.": "Billy",
  "Where there is truth and error there is always compromise. Within some churches there is a movement to reshape the Christian messageto make it more acceptable to man.": "Billy",
  "If our minds and hearts are not filled with God\u2019s truth, something else will take His place: cynicism, occultism, false religions and philosophies, drugs\u2014the list is endless.": "Billy",
  "At the end of his life Buddha said: \u201cI am still searching for truth.\u201d This statement could be made by countless thousands of scientists, philosophers, and religious leaders throughout all history. However, Jesus Christ made the astounding claim: I am . . . the truth\u201d [John 14:6]. He is the embodiment of all truth. The only answer to man\u2019s search is found in Him.": "Billy",
  "It is Satan\u2019s purpose to steal the seed of truth from your heart by sending distracting thoughts . . . The difference between a Christian and a non-Christian is: though they both may have good and evil thoughts, Christ gives His followers strength to select the right rather than the wrong.": "Billy",
  "The Holy Spirit can take God\u2019s word of truthand minister it to our deepest needs.": "Billy",
  "It is far better to know God\u2019s truth than to be ignorant of it.": "Billy",
  "Honesty means exactly what it says. We are honest and trustworthy in all our dealings. People can trust our word, because we refuse to lie or shade the truth.": "Billy",
  "We have changed our moral code to fit our behavior instead of changing our behavior to harmonize with God\u2019s moral code.": "Billy",
  "We have glamorized vice and minimized virtue. We have played down gentleness, manners, and morals\u2014while we have played up rudeness, savagery, and vice . . . and the philosophy of \u201cmight is right.": "Billy",
  "We do not need a new moral order": "the",
  "The Bible teaches that man can undergo a radical spiritual and moral change that is brought about by God Himself.": "Billy",
  "What happens when lying and stealing and immorality and murder become the norm? The result can be summarized in one word: chaos.": "Billy",
  "Immorality is glorified today. The Scripture teaches that God hates immorality! The ideal of purity is scorned, immorality is laughed at in school\u2014\u201cGod is old-fashioned!\u201d What else can we expect but that thousands of our young people are growing up to be immoral?7": "Billy",
  "The first and second commandments are the only therapy the world has ever needed. \u201cThou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind . . . Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself\u201d [Matthew 22:37, 39 KJV].": "Billy",
  "This is a high-strung, neurotic, impatient age. We hurry when there is no reason to hurry, just to be hurrying. This fast-paced age has produced more problems and less morality than previous generations, and it has given us jangled nerves. Impatience as produced a crop of broken homes, ulcers, and has set the stage for more world wars.": "Billy",
  "Moral living sometimes demands difficult choices. It requires selflessness.": "Billy",
  "The fact that immorality is rampant throughout the nation doesn\u2019t make it right!": "Billy",
  "The Ten Commandments are just as valid today as they were when God gave them. They reflect the moral character of God, and they also provide the foundation of right living with others.": "Billy",
  "The Bible says more about hell than about heaven.": "Billy",
  "No one spoke more about hell than Jesus did, and the hell He came to save men from was not only a hell on earth . . .it was something to come.": "Billy",
  "We will be judged according to our ability. The retired couple who count the offering every Sunday, never divulging the amount anyone in the congregation contributes, will not be tested in the same way as the millionaire who wants an inscription on the stained glass window, so everyone will know who donated it. Some of the most severe tests will be given to the [preachers] for the way in which they handled the Word of God. There will be no reward for leading others astray in lifestyle or in doctrine through false teaching.": "Billy",
  "When we all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, we will have our true motives revealed.": "Billy",
  "Integrity is the glue that holds our way of life together. What our young people want to see in their elders is integrity, honesty, truthfulness, and faith. What they hate most of all is hypocrisy and phoniness . . . Let them see us doing what we would like them to do.": "Billy",
  "[Integrity] means a person is the same on the inside as he or she claims to be on the outside. He is the same person alone in a hotel room a thousand miles from home as he is at work or in his community or with his family. A man of integrity can be trusted.": "Billy",
  "Being pure in conduct also includes honesty and integrity in dealing with our fellowmen. A Christian should be known in his neighborhood or place of business as an honest person.": "Billy",
  "A godly person\u2014one who serves Christ and exhibits purity and integrity in his life\u2014is not necessarily welcomed or admired by those who live differently. They may even react in scorn, or refuse to include a christian in their social gatherings because his very presence is a rebuke to them.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s standard is expressed in the Bible, and the ultimate example of that standard is Jesus Christ. When we live by the truth, we possess integrity.": "Billy",
  "Integrity means that we are trustworthy and dependable, and our character is above reproach.": "Billy",
  "Unless men of purpose, integrity, and faith stand together in unswerving loyalty to Jesus Christ, the future of the world is dark indeed.": "Billy",
  "I believe integrity can be restored to a society one person at a time. The choice belongs to each of us.": "Billy",
  "Our world today is looking for men and women with integrity, for communicators who back up their ministry with their lives. Our preaching emerges out of what we are. We are called to be a holy people\u2014separated from the moral evils of the world.": "Billy",
  "The truth is that others judge us. More than that, they evaluate the truth of the Gospel by what they see of our lives and our integrity. [We] must make every effort to be above all suspicion in the matter of finances and statistics. We are not only accountable to God\u2019s people, but also to our Master (see Acts 24:16).": "Billy",
  "We will be judged according to the secret motives and the character of our work. If we have done our work for selfish motives or personal gain, even if the results looked noble to our friends and family, God knows our hearts.": "Billy",
  "Hundreds of passages point to a time of judgment for every person who has ever lived\u2014none will escape. If you took all the references to judgment out of the Bible, you would have little Bible left.": "Billy",
  "Integrity means that if our private life was suddenly exposed, we\u2019d have no reason to be ashamed or embarrassed. Integrity means our outward life is consistent with our inner convictions.": "Billy",
  "God has already set the date [for judgment]. You may make and break appointments in this life, but this is one appointment you are going to keep.": "Billy",
  "People judge us not by what we think or believe, but by what we do\u2014and when our lives don\u2019t measure up, we lose their respect and they conclude our faith isn\u2019t real.": "Billy",
  "I believe that one of the reasons for crime, perversion, and the evils of modern mankind is that we have lost belief in the certainty of God being just, holy, and righteous, and that He will judge the world.": "Billy",
  "A call for national and individual repentance is urgently needed today, or judgment is certain to fall.": "Billy",
  "God judges mankind by the standard of the only God-man who ever lived, Jesus Christ. Jesus, the innocent Lamb of God, stands between our sin and the judgment of God the Father.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s judgment echoes the sound of hoofbeats, but God\u2019s love quietly convicts.": "Billy",
  "In character-building and in living the Christian life, concentration is important. The [person] who has a general interest in everything usually isn\u2019t too good at anything.": "Billy",
  "None of us deserves God\u2019s love. All of us deserve His righteous judgment and wrath (John 3:18, 36; Romans 3:9\u201312). It is easy to think of an evil and depraved man like Adolf Hitler deserving divine judgment . . .But think of the kind and good people that you know . . .They too will be lost if they refuse and neglect God\u2019s offer of mercy and forgiveness. God\u2019s judgment applies to them too.": "Billy",
  "But the judgment of God is not only an event that may take place some day in history when war or conflict might bring death to millions. His judgment is more than death\u2014it is eternal banishment from the presence of God (2 Thessalonians 1:6\u201310": "Revelation",
  "One of the real tests of Christian character is to be found in the lives we live from day to day.": "Billy",
  "Instead of clinging to the only Lifeboat that can save, we have tossed overboard biblical truths in the name of [compromise], living on the edge of life, like the man who rides the parameter of a hurricane, daring it to sweep him away.": "Billy",
  "God promises no easy life or days without troubles, trials, difficulties, and temptations. He never promises that life will be perfect. He does not call His children to a playground, but to a battleground.": "Billy",
  "Be attractive and winsome, but do not compromise your convictions for the sake of popularity.": "Billy",
  "When Jesus was tempted, He didn\u2019t debate the devil. He quoted Scripture: \u201cIt is written . . . It is written . . . It is written\u201d (Matthew 4:4\u201310 NKJV). And each time the devil was defeated.": "Billy",
  "We can\u2019t flee from temptation in our own strength\u2014but God will give us the strength we need, if we\u2019ll only seek it. A friend of mine says, \u201cWhen the devil knocks, I just send Jesus to the door!": "Billy",
  "It is not the temptations you have, but the decision you make about them that counts.": "Billy",
  "Everyone has temptations but some folks entertain them . . .Get your eyes off the temptation and onto Christ!": "Billy",
  "I know that many of the things I have said from the Scriptures have offended, and I have sometimes been tempted to tone down the message. But, God helping me, I never will! I would become a false prophet. I would also betray my Lord.": "Billy",
  "Satan is the sower of compromise\u2014leaving a bit of God\u2019s truth into the dirty rags of sin. Satan is the commander in deceit, Satan is the ringleader in rebellion against the faithful.Satan is the sly serpent of temptation.Satan is the false hope of security.Satan is the great pretender.Satan is the great spoiler of everything good.And Satan wants to destroy you.": "Billy",

  "Be sure that Satan will tempt you at your weak point, not the strong.": "Billy",
  "Many Christians give in to various temptations through peer pressure and find themselves surrendering to worldly passions, justifying pleasures the world offers.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t savor temptations; don\u2019t dwell on them or toy with them or replay them over and over in your mind. The more you think about a particular temptation, the more enticing it becomes.": "Billy",
  "All of us are not subjected to the same weaknesses and temptations.To one, alcohol may be the temptation;to another, it may be impure thoughts and acts; to another, greed and covetousness; to another, criticism and an unloving attitude.": "Billy",
  "Temptation is not a sin. It is the yielding that is sin. All temptation is from the devil.": "Billy",
  "Only a strong faith\u2014a faith based on God\u2019s Word\u2014will protect us from temptation and doubt.": "Billy",
  "A thought enters": "we",
  "The Bible is intensely practical, and one of the reasons God gave it to us is so we\u2019ll be better prepared to deal with life\u2019s problems and temptations. All too often we respond to these in ways that don\u2019t reflect Christ . . .when we do that, Satan is the winner and the cause of Christ suffers.": "Billy",
  "Temptation: Recognize it for what it is, and then reject it\u2014immediately and without compromise.": "Billy",

  "True greatness is not measured by the headlines a person commands or the wealth he or she accumulates. The inner character of a person\u2014the undergirding moral and spiritual values and commitments\u2014is the true measure of lasting greatness.": "Billy",

  "A godlikeness of character is the Christian\u2019s proper heritage in this earthly walk.": "Billy",
  "Trials and difficulties may assail the life of a believer, but they also have the ability to remold his character and banish from his life those impurities which might impair growth and service.": "Billy",
  "Consistency, constancy, and undeviating diligence to maintain Christian character are a must if the older generation is to command respect, or even a hearing, from the young.": "Billy",
  "A few years ago, honesty was the hallmark of a man of good character. But it\u2019s been set aside for an \u201cIt\u2019s all right if you don\u2019t get caught\u201d philosophy.": "Billy",
  "It is unfair to attribute virtues beyond a person\u2019s true character.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t conform to those who have been overwhelmed by the tide of immorality sweeping our country!": "Billy",
  "Peer pressure accounts for much of the promiscuous sex in high schools and colleges. \u201cConform or get lost.\u201d Since no one enjoys losing friends or being cast out of his own circle, peer pressure\u2014especially during the years of adolescence\u2014is an almost irresistible force.": "Billy",
  "From compromise to deceit is a small step.": "Billy",
  "The apostle Paul urges Christians everywhere in all ages to be nonconformists as far as the world system is concerned. We are not to conform. A true Christian, living an obedient life, is a constant rebuke to those who accept themoral standards of this world.": "Billy",
  "Thousands of Christians compromise their faith in Jesus Christ by denying Him. Even some clergymen neglect or deliberately refuse to close a public prayer in the name of Jesus for fear of offending an unbeliever. They cannot endure the persecution that may follow an acknowledgment of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "It is often asked, \u201cHow could the early disciples turn the world upside downwhen millions of Christians can\u2019t even keep it right side up today?\u201d The answer is they didn\u2019t conform their faith to match the world. They had the truth, and they refused to water it down. They had a faith that would not compromise.": "Billy",
  "The apostle Paul said, \u201cBe not conformed to this world.\u201d These words cut like a sharp sword across our way of life. They have the tone of the battle call in them. They separate the weak from the strong. But they are words of inspiration, and we need to hear them today.": "Billy",
  "Thousands of uninstructed Christians are being deceived today.False teachers use high-sounding wordsthat seem like the epitome of scholarship and culture. They are intellectually clever and crafty . . .adept at beguiling thoughtless, untaught men and women.": "Billy",
  "It is a tragedy that many of God\u2019s people have conformed themselves to the world and its thinking, rather than being transformed by the renewing of their minds.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s purpose for us is that we ought to beconformed to the image of His Son. The world may exert its pressure to deform us, but we are told to \u201cbe transformed\u201d [Romans 12:2 NIV].": "Billy",
  "Pure hearts will be Christlike. It is God\u2019s desire that we be conformed to the image of His Son.": "Billy",
  "The underlying principle of all Satan\u2019s tactics is deception. He is a crafty and clever camouflager.": "Billy",
  "Satan\u2019s method has often been to imitate God.Satan is still using this form of deception, and often his representatives are being disguised as ministers of righteousness.": "Billy",
  "For Satan\u2019s deceptions to be successful, they must be so cunningly devised that his real purpose is concealed by wiles.": "Billy",
  "We see ourselves as self-sufficient, self-important, and self-sustaining. God sees us as dependent, self-centered, and self-deceived.": "Billy",
  "The pagan world is still trying to put its stamp of conformity on every follower of Jesus Christ. Every possible pressure is being brought to bear upon Christiansto make them conform to the standards of the present world . . .be a committed follower of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "There is a great counterfeiter who adapts himself to every culture, even deceiving true believers at times. He doesn\u2019t charge on the scene clothed in red and wearing a hideous mask but charms his way as an \u201cangel of light.\u201d This is how Satan operates.": "Billy",
  "Believers need the gift of discernment, or at least respect for the opinions of those who have it . . .believers are to test the various spirits and doctrines that abound.Most of all we are to test them against thestandard of the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Our culture will stand in roaring ovations for the illusionists, escape artists, and magicians. Deception is everything opposite the truth.": "Billy",
  "It is important to realize that a person with the gift of discernment can often tell the difference between what is of God and what is not. Such a person can often point out false teachings or false teachers\u2014he has an almost uncanny ability to perceivehypocrisy, shallowness, deceit, or phoniness.": "Billy",

  "If we are at peace with this world, it may be because we have sold out to it and compromised with it.": "Billy",
  "Daniel and his companions were tempted to forsake their godly heritage but they refused. They even faced a fiery furnace rather than compromise.": "Billy",
  "We are to renounce the evil influence of the world, the flesh, and the devil. There can be no parleying, bargaining, compromise, or hesitation. Christ demands total loyalty.": "Billy",
  "Too many Christian TV and radio programs have been geared to please, entertain, and gain the favor of the world. The temptation is to compromise, to make the gospel more appealing and attractive.": "Billy",
  "One of our most deep-seated fears is that we might be called an \u201coutsider.\u201d This fear has led us down the road to conformity, has put the imprint of \u201cthe organization man\u201d on our souls, and has robbed us of originality of thought, individuality of personality, and constructive action.": "Billy",
  "Christ needs people today who are made of martyr stuff! Dare to take a strong, uncompromised stand for Him.": "Billy",
  "The devil has successfully fooled many churches, convincing them to follow the world. Biblical standards have been compromised by convenient social theories.": "Billy",
  "The Scripture teaches that popularity with the world means death. Satan\u2019s most effective tool is conformity and compromise. He is aware that one man standing in the midst of a pagan peoplecan move more people in the direction of God than thousands of insipid professors of religion.": "Billy",

  "I have read the last page of the Bible. It isall going to turn out all right.": "Billy",

  "The Bible tells us that the state of the world will grow darker as we near the end of the age.": "Billy",
  "[It] is well and good when our convictions are based upon the \u201cThou shalts\u201d and the \u201cThou shalt nots\u201d of Scripture rather than our own ideas.": "Billy",

  "A new world is coming . . . The paradise that man lost will be regained . . . One day we will live in a brand-new world.": "Billy",
  "Man seeks to excuse himself of sin, but God seeks to convict him of it and to save him from it. Sin is no amusing toy\u2014it is a terror to be shunned! Learn, then, what constitutes sin in the eyes of God!": "Billy",

  "We can\u2019t go on much longer morally. We can\u2019t go on much longer scientifically. The technology that was supposed to save us is ready to destroy us. New weapons are being made all the time, including chemical and biological weapons. Today the only bright spot on the horizon of this world is the promise of the coming again of Christ.": "Billy",
  "The study [of Revelation] instructs us not only about the storms to come, but how to endure and come through them with great victory.": "Billy",
  "The very ones whose social pressure cause you to compromise will despise you for it. They probably respect your convictions,and many of them wish they had the moral stamina to stand alone.May the Lord give you added courage to be a witness for Him,even in a hard place.": "Billy",
  "There are those today that say we must do as others do, that we must conform to the world [to win it], that we must swim with the tide, that we must move with the crowd. But the believer should say, \u201cNo.": "Billy",
  "We are like a people under [a] sentence of death, waiting for the date to be set. We sense that something is about to happen.We know that things cannot go on as they are. History has reached an impasse. We are now on a collision course. Something is about to give.": "Billy",
  "We see the storm clouds gathering and events taking place that herald the second coming of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Revelation is a pastor\u2019s letter to his floundering flock, an urgent telegram bearing a brilliant battle plan for a people at war.": "Billy",
  "I believe that this world, as we know it, will come to an end . . . This is not fanciful imagination but the clear and repeated testimony of the Bible.": "Billy",

  "When comfort and ease and pleasure are put ahead of duty and conviction, progress is always set back.": "Billy",
  "In the end there will be people who did the work of the Lord. They were busy in the church. They had done many wonderful works. But Jesus Himself says, \u201cI never knew you\u201d [Matthew 7:23 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "Evil is real\u2014but so is God\u2019s power and love.": "Billy",
  "Learn to take sin seriously\u2014be on guard against it and resist its tug, fight its power. But most of all learn to take the Holy Spirit seriously, calling on Him to help you overcome sin\u2019s power and live a holy and godly life.": "Billy",
  "You cannot pray for someone and hate them at the same time. Even if you are asking God to restrain their evil actions,you should also be praying that He will change their hearts. Only eternity will reveal the impact of our prayers for others.": "Billy",
  "God can break the chain of every sin that binds you if you are willing to give it up. He comes into your heart and gives you power to overcome sin.": "Billy",
  "Man got into difficulty when he lifted his will against God\u2019s. He gets out of trouble when he bows to the divine superiority, when he repents and says humbly: \u201cGod be merciful to me a sinner.\u201d Man\u2019s extremity then becomes God\u2019s opportunity.": "Billy",
  "Perversion is considered a biological abnormality rather than a sin. These things are contrary to the teaching of God\u2019s Word. And God has not changed. His standards have not been lowered. God still calls immorality a sin and the Bible says God is going to judge it.": "Billy",
  "We do not have a paradise on earth": "it",
  "Guard your tongue, and use it for good instead of evil. How many marriages or friendships have been destroyed because of criticism that spiraled out of control?

  "Sin is rebellion against God.": "Billy",
  "If God were to eradicate all evil from this planet, He would have to eradicate all evil men. Who would be exempt? \u201cFor all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God\u201d [Romans 3:23 NIV].God would rather transform the evil man than eradicate him.": "Billy",

  "The Bible teaches that whosoever is born of God does not practice sin.": "Billy",
  "Sinful pleasure can ruin our appetite for the things of God.": "Billy",

  "Sooner or later we must leave our dream world and face up to the facts of God, sin, and judgment. The Bible says, \u201cAll have sinned and come short of the glory of God\u201d [Romans 3:23 NIV].": "Billy",
  "We have largely lost sight of the holiness and purity of God today. This is one reason why we tolerate sin so easily.": "Billy",

  "We all have a terminal disease far worse than cancer that will kill us morally and spiritually.It\u2019s called sin.": "Billy",
  "Superficial views of God and His holiness will produce superficial views of sin and atonement. God hates sin. It is His uncompromising foe. Sin is vile and detestable in the sight of God . . .The sinner and God are at opposite poles of the moral universe.": "Billy",

  "When we use the word \u201csin,\u201d we usually think of our misdeeds\u2014actions or habits we know are wrong.

  "When I have a problem of deciding right from wrong, I always give it three tests.First, I give it the common-sense test, and ask if it is reasonable. Then, I give it the prayer test.

It is the happiness and contentment that fills the soul even in the midst of the most distressing circumstances and the most bitter environment. It is the kind of happiness that grins when things go wrong and smiles through the tears.

  "Cheap grace means grace sold on the market like cheapjacks' wares. The sacraments, the forgiveness of sin, and the consolations of religion are thrown away at cut prices. Grace is represented as the Church's inexhaustible treasury, from which she showers blessings with generous hands, without asking questions or fixing limits. Grace without price; grace without cost! The essence of grace, we suppose, is that the account has been paid in advance; and, because it has been paid, everything can be had for nothing. Since the cost was infinite, the possibilities of using and spending it are infinite. What would grace be if it were not cheap?...Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without requiring repentance, baptism without church discipline, Communion without confession, absolution without personal confession. Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus Christ, living and incarnate.Costly grace is the treasure hidden in the field; for the sake of it a man will go and sell all that he has. It is the pearl of great price to buy which the merchant will sell all his goods. It is the kingly rule of Christ, for whose sake a man will pluck out the eye which causes him to stumble; it is the call of Jesus Christ at which the disciple leaves his nets and follows him.Costly grace is the gospel which must be sought again and again, the gift which must be asked for, the door at which a man must knock.Such grace is costly because it calls us to follow, and it is grace because it calls us to follow Jesus Christ. It is costly because it costs a man his life, and it is grace because it gives a man the only true life. It is costly because it condemns sin, and grace because it justifies the sinner. Above all, it is costly because it cost God the life of his Son: \"ye were bought at a price,\" and what has cost God much cannot be cheap for us. Above all, it is grace because God did not reckon his Son too dear a price to pay for our life, but delivered him up for us. Costly grace is the Incarnation of God.": "Dietrich",

  "The ones whose light will remain with me long after they have burnt out are the ones that had grace. Because it's rare that the gift comes with grace. Some of the biggest arseholes I've ever met are the most gifted. Because it's \"pretty girl\" syndrome. Being gifted is like being born beautiful. You don't have to work a day in a year in your life for it. You were born with it. In one sense, it's like blue blood, money, gift, or beauty. They are the things that should make you the most humble, because they are not the things you have earned. They are the things you were given. Yet, it is my experience that they male people the most spoiled. And the people who work the hardest, and who have overcome the most obstacles on their life, who have reason to beat their breasts are the most humble, sometimes. I can't get over that. it's bewildering to me. To make it through success and still have manners, to still have curiosity, intellectual curiosity, to still have some grace, to keep your dignity, that is really... rare.": "Bono,",

What I saw now was the community imperfect and irresolute but held together by the frayed and always fraying, incomplete and yet ever-holding bonds of the various sorts of affection. There had maybe never been anybody who had not been loved by somebody, who had been loved by somebody else, and so on and on... It was a community always disappointed in itself, disappointing its members, always trying to contain its divisions and gentle its meanness, always failing and yet always preserving a sort of will toward goodwill. I knew that, in the midst of all the ignorance and error, this was a membership; it was the membership of Port William and of no other place on earth. My vision gathered the community as it never has been and never will be gathered in this world of time, for the community must always be marred by members who are indifferent to it or against it, who are nonetheless its members and maybe nonetheless essential to it. And yet I saw them all as somehow perfected, beyond time, by one another's love, compassion, and forgiveness, as it is said we may be perfected by grace.": "Wendell",

Of course, the problem is that we never obey these simple commands. We always love ourselves more than we love God or others. We are always erecting idols in our hearts and worshipping and serving them. We are always more focused on what we want and how we might get it than we are on loving Him and laying down our life for others. The law does show us the right way to live, but none of us obeys it. Not for one millisecond.Even though our children cannot and will not obey God's law, we need to teach it to them again and again. And when they tell us that they can't love God or others in this way, we are not to argue with them. We are to agree with them and tell them of their need for a Savior.": "Elyse",

It's clear to me that Karma is at the very heart of the universe. I'm absolutely sure of it. And yet, along comes this idea called Grace to upend all that \"as you reap, so you will sow\" stuff. Grace defies reason and logic. Love interrupts, if you like, the consequences of your actions, which in my case is very good news indeed, because I've done a lot of stupid stuff. But I'd be in big trouble if Karma was going to finally be my judge. I'd be in deep s---. It doesn't excuse my mistakes, but I'm holding out for Grace.

Would He have given the stars their glory, the birds their sweet song, and the flowers, their fragrance if He had not wished us to delight in them? I shave sinned before men and men have condemned me. God made me a man with passions of a man, and did He give them to me only that I should suppress them? He gave me my adventurous spirit and my love of life. I have a humble hope that when I am face to face with my Maker He will condone my imperfections and I shall find mercy in His sight.": "W.",

There is only this world, the world in which our nature has been created for a supernatural destiny. Historically, there never was a graceless nature, or a world outside the Christian dispensation. This traditional conception of human nature as always destined for grace-given union with God fell apart between attempts, on the one hand, to secure the sheer gratuitousness of the economy of grace over against the naturalist anthropologies of Renaissance humanism and, on the other hand, resistance to what was perceived by Counter-Reformation Catholics as the Protestant doctrine of the total corruption of human nature by original sin. The Catholic theologians, who sought to protect the supernatural by separating it conceptually from the natural, facilitated the development of the humanism which flowered at the Enlightenment into deism, agnosticism and ultimately atheism. The conception of the autonomous individual for which the philosophers of the Age of Reason were most bitterly criticized by devout Catholics was, de Lubac suggested, invented by Catholic theologians. The philosophers which broke free of Christianity, to develop their own naturalist and deist theologies, had their roots in the anti-Protestant and anti-Renaissance Catholic Scholasticism of the late sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries.": "Fergus",

  "The Grace represents the interconnection of everything, the world of life and the world of the dead, Additive and Subtractive, as well as the spark of the gift that runs though it all. The Grace does more though, than simply represent Additive and Subtractive magic, Creation and obliteration, life and death, it connects them into a cohesive whole. The power of Orden deals with life, death and the whole nature of existence so the key also needs to have both sides. It needs both Additive and Subtractive, life and death to be complete.": "Terry",
  "A man makes himself hard and inflexible in order to escape his guiltiness. The strange paradox present on every page of the Gospels and which we can verify any day, is that it is not guilt which is the obstacle to grace, as moralism supposes.

  "One-way love is rare, though, and it always comes as a surprise. Fortunately, the glimpses we receive in relationships are only a foreshadowing of God's love for us.

  "The Bible is not a witness to the best people making it up to God; it's a witness to God making it down to the worst people. Far from being a book full of moral heroes whom we are commanded to emulate, what we discover is that the so-called heroes in the Bible are not really heroes at all. They fall and fail; they make huge mistakes; they get afraid; they're selfish, deceptive, egotistical, and unreliable. The Bible is one long story of God meeting our rebellion with His rescue, our sin with His salvation, our guilt with His grace, our badness with His goodness.": "Tullian",

We learn that grace is an unmistakable priority in the Christian life. We learn that it is from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, but that it can come through people. We learn that grace is ready to flow to us every time we take up the inspired Scriptures to read them. And we learn that grace will abide with us when we lay the Bible down and go about our daily living. In other words, we learn that grace is not merely a past reality but a future one. Every time I reach for the Bible, God's grace is a reality that will flow to me. Every time I put the Bible down and go about my business, God's grace will go with me. This is what I mean by future grace.": "John",

  "On a superficial level, self-esteem techniques and a tough \"refusal to allow others to hurt me\" tactic may work for the short term. But what happens for the abused person on a bad day, a bad month, or a bad year? Sin and the effects of sin are similar to the laws of inertia: a person (or object) in motion will continue on that trajectory until acted upon by an outside force. If one is devastated by sin, a personal failure to rise above the effects of sin will simply create a snowball effect of shame. Hurting people need something from the outside to stop the downward spiral. Fortunately, grace floods in from the outside at the point when hope to change oneself is lost. Grace declares and promises that you will be healed. One-way love does not command \"Heal thyself!\" but declares \"You will be healed!": "Justin",

Maybe we're supposed to think what's in it for me? far less than we do. Maybe we need to sacrifice more.

  "Christ is all in the entire work of salvation. Let me just take you back to the period before this world was made. There was a time when this great world, the sun, the moon, the stars, and all which now exist throughout the whole of the vast universe, lay in the mind of God, like unborn forests in an acorn cup. There was a time when the Great Creator lived alone, and yet he could foresee that he would make a world, and that men would be born to people it; and in that vast eternity a great scheme was devised, whereby he might save a fallen race. Do you know who devised it? God planned it from first to last. Neither Gabriel nor any of the holy angels had anything to do with it. I question whether they were even told how God might be just, and yet save the transgressors. God was all in the drawing up of the scheme, and Christ was all in carrying it out. There was a dark and doleful night! Jesus was in the garden, sweating great drops of blood, which fell to the ground; nobody then came to bear the load that had been laid upon him. An angel stood there to strengthen him, but not to bear the sentence. The cup was put into his hands, and Jesus said, \"Father, must I drink it?\" and his Father replied, \"If thou dost not drink, sinners cannot be saved\"; and he took the cup and drained it to its very dregs. No man helped him. And when he hung upon that accursed tree of Calvary, when his precious hands were pierced, when: \"From his head, his hands, his feet, Sorrow and love flowed mingled down,\" there was nobody to help him. He was \"all\" in the work of salvation. And, my friends, if any of you shall be saved, it must be by Christ alone. There must be no patchwork; Christ did it all, and will not be helped in the matter. Christ will not allow you, as some say, to do what you can, and leave him to make up the rest. What can you do that is not sinful? Christ has done all for us; the work of redemption is all finished. Christ planned it all, and worked out all; and we, therefore, preach a full salvation through Jesus Christ.": "Charles",
  "Not only have we not done the good things that God really wants us to do, but in fact, we\u2019ve done just the opposite.

  "If I had to sum up the gospel I should have to tell you certain facts: Jesus, the Son of God, became man; he was born of the virgin Mary; lived a perfect life; was falsely accused of men; was crucified, dead, and buried; the third day he rose again from the dead; he ascended into heaven and sitteth on the right hand of God; from whence he shall also come to judge the quick and the dead. This is one of the elementary truths of our gospel; we believe in the resurrection of the dead, the final judgment, and the life everlasting.": "Charles",

  "My friends, I do not believe it is preaching Christ and him crucified, to give people a batch of philosophy every Sunday morning and evening, and neglect the truths of this Holy Book. I do not believe it is preaching Christ and him crucified, to leave out the main cardinal doctrines of the Word of God, and preach a religion which is all a mist and a haze, without any definite truths whatever. I take it that man does not preach Christ and him crucified, who can get through a sermon without mentioning Christ's name once; nor does that man preach Christ and him crucified, who leaves out the Holy Spirit's work, who never says a word about the Holy Ghost, so that indeed the hearers might say, \"We do not so much as know whether there be a Holy Ghost.\" And I have my own private opinion, that there is no such thing as preaching Christ and him crucified, unless you preach what now-a-days is called Calvinism. I have my own ideas, and those I always state boldly. It is a nickname to call it Calvinism. Calvinism is the gospel, and nothing else. I do not believe we can preach the gospel, if we do not preach justification by faith without works; not unless we preach the sovereignty of God in his dispensation of grace; nor unless we exalt the electing, unchangeable, eternal, immutable, conquering love of Jehovah; nor, I think, can we preach the gospel, unless we base it upon the peculiar redemption which Christ made for his elect and chosen people; nor can I comprehend a gospel which lets saints fall away after they are called, and suffers the children of God to be burned in the fires of damnation, after having believed. Such a gospel I abhor. The gospel of the Bible is not such a gospel as that. We preach Christ and him crucified in a different fashion, and to all gainsayers we reply, \"We have not so learned Christ.": "Charles",

  "The more deeply one enters into the experience of the sacred the more one is aware of one\u2019s own personal evil and the destructive forces in society. The fact that one is alive to what is possible for humankind sharpens one\u2019s sense that we are fallen people. The awareness of sin is the inevitable consequence of having met grace... This grace-judgment dynamic reveals that the center of Christian life is repentance. This does not mean that the distinguishing mark of the Christian is breast-beating. Feeling sorry, acknowledging guilt, and prolonging regret may be components of the human condition, but they are not what Jesus means by repentance. Repentance is the response to grace that overcomes the past and opens out to a new future. Repentance distinguishes Christian life as one of struggle and conversion and pervades it, not with remorse, but with hope. The message of Jesus is not \u201cRepent,\u201d but \u201cRepent for the Kingdom of God is near.": "John",
  "Despite the differences in detail and in emphasis in Wesley's exposition of the two sacraments, there is an underlying unity in his sacramental theology. He regarded both sacraments as means whereby God could confer grace according to His promise, but yet insisted, that in order to prevent the means from being mistaken as ends, it was necessary for there to be an appropriation of the grace held out by the faith of the believer. Grace was not conferred IN SPITE OF MAN, but only with his co-operation. So human response was necessary for the efficacy of the sacraments, although man's actions were never thought of as meritorious works.": "John",
  "Repentance in Greek means something much closer to \"thinking differently afterward\" than it does \"changing your cheating ways.\" Of course repentance can look like a prostitute becoming a librarian, but it can also look like a prostitute simply saying, \"OK, I'm a sex worker and I don't know how to change that, but I can come here and receive bread and wine and I can hold onto the love of God without being deemed worthy of it by anyone but God.": "Nadia",

  "I've also represented people who have committed terrible crimes but nonetheless struggle to recover and to find redemption. I have discovered, deep in the hearts of many condemned and incarcerated people, the scattered traces of hope and humanity - seeds of restoration that come to astonishing life when nurtured by very simple interventions.Proximity has taught me some basic and humbling truths, including this vital lesson: Each of us is more than the worst thing we've ever done. My work with the poor and incarcerated has persuaded me that the opposite of poverty is not wealth; the opposite of poverty is justice. Finally, I've come to believe that the true measure of our commitment to justice, the character of our society, our commitment to the rule of law, fairness, and equality cannot be measured by how we treat the rich, the powerful, the privileged, and the respected among us. The true measure of our character is how we treat the poor, the disfavored, the accused, the incarcerated, and the condemned.We are all implicated when we allow other people to be mistreated. An absence of compassion can corrupt the decency of a community, a state, a nation. Fear and anger can make us vindictive and abusive, unjust and unfair, until we all suffer from the absence of mercy and we condemn ourselves as much as we victimize others. The closer we get to mass incarceration and extreme levels of punishment, the more I believe it's never to recognize that we all need mercy, we all need justice, and - perhaps - we all need some measure of unmerited grace.": "Bryan",

  "Grace strikes us when we are in great pain and restlessness. It strikes us when we walk through the dark valley of a meaningless and empty life. It strikes us when our disgust for our own being, our indifference, our weakness, our hostility, and our lack of direction and composure have become intolerable to us. It strikes us when, year after year, the longed-for perfection of life does not appear, when the old compulsions reign within us as they have for decades, when despair destroys all joy and courage.

  "If Christ be a fraud, he was among the most peculiar yet brilliant of frauds in saying that only he was the way, the truth, and the life. This is the importance of grace - some people think that simply being nice and not harming others is morality; others think that following rules and tithing are morality.

If you would understand it, you must cease haggling over your pet ideas, and with humble hears survey the atonement.  This matter is so dimly comprehended that thousands upon thousands claiming to be sons of God are children of the wicked one, because they will depend on their own works. God always demanded good works, the law demands it, but because man placed himself in sin where his good works were valueless, Jesus' righteousness alone can avail.

But if you think, as it were, This is an emissary sent from the Lord, and some benefit is intended for me, first of all the occasion to demonstrate my faithfulness, the chance to show that I do in some small degree participate in the grace that saved me, you are free to act otherwise than as circumstances would seem to dictate.

But there\u2019s no rush. There are no deadlines. There\u2019s comfort in staying in our cocoons. Only when we lose that comfort and feel overwhelmed do we feel forced to reach up for something greater. Or, we simply feel the calling for more.

They held hands, kissed and were as affectionate as any cute couple could be. They were both in their eighties. I asked them how long they were married. I expected them to tell me fifty years or longer. To my surprise, they said only five years. He then began to explain to me that he was married thirty years to someone that didn\u2019t love him, and then he remarried a second time only to have his second wife die of cancer, two years later. I looked at my patient (his wife) sitting in the wheelchair next to him smiling. She added that she had been widowed two times. Both of her marriages lasted fifteen years. I was curious, so I asked them why they would even bother pursuing love again at their age. He looked at me with astonishment and said, \u201cDo you really think that you stop looking for a soulmate at our age? Do you honestly believe that God would stop caring about how much I needed it still, just because I am nearing the end of my life? No, he left the best for last.

  "This is where Jean's stubbornness and, perhaps, God's stubborn grace came into play. \u201cMy definition of grace would be multifaceted, but part of it would certainly be God's passion for brokenness. He does, he really does love brokenness,\u201d Jean told me. \u201cGrace doesn't obsess with ourselves. It obsesses with people and with brokenness.

On the way back down the hiking trail after my encounter with the hawk in Big Sky, I stopped thinking and started looking and listening.

  "Everyone experiences grace, even if they don't realize it. It's kind of like Moby's music.

  "When Annunziata said she loved me or any of her thousands of other friends and beloveds, she was really saying, at least in my mind, \u201cGod loves you.\u201d To quote the singer/songwriter James Taylor, she showered the people she loved with love, always showing the way that she felt without holding back. Even as her body could barely contain her soul any longer, she'd open wide the gates of herself with a smile, that giggle, her twinkling eyes, and she'd let the supernatural love flow through her. Walking out of the chapel after her funeral, a woman I'd never seen before stopped me and said, \u201cYou're Cathleen, aren't you?\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d I croaked, tears rolling off my nose as I fingered the prayer card with Annunziata's picture on it.

  "Then I fell at his feet and thought, Surely this is the hour of death, for the Lion (who is worthy of all honour) will know that I have served Tash all my days and not him. Nevertheless, it is better to see the Lion and die than to be Tisroc of the world and live and not to have seen him. But the Glorious One bent down his golden head and touched my forehead with his tongue and said, Son, thou art welcome. But I said, Alas Lord, I am no son of thine but the servant of Tash. He answered, Child, all the service thou hast done to Tash, I account as service done to me. Then by reasons of my great desire for wisdom and understanding, I overcame my fear and questioned the Glorious One and said, Lord, is it then true, as the Ape said, that thou and Tash are one? The Lion growled so that the earth shook (but his wrath was not against me) and said, It is false. Not because he and I are one, but because we are opposites, I take to me the services which thou hast done to him. For I and he are of such different kinds that no service which is vile can be done to me, and none which is not vile can be done to him. Therefore if any man swear by Tash and keep his oath for the oath\u2019s sake, it is by me that he has truly sworn, though he know it not, and it is I who reward him. And if any man do a cruelty in my name, then, though he says the name Aslan, it is Tash whom he serves and by Tash his deed is accepted. Dost thou understand, Child? I said, Lord, though knowest how much I understand. But I said also (for the truth constrained me), Yet I have been seeking Tash all my days. Beloved, said the Glorious One, unless thy desire had been for me thou wouldst not have sought so long and so truly. For all find what they truly seek.": "C.S.",

We are not free to approach the image as we wish; the image is free to assign us a perspective proper to itself... Anamorphosis, then, describes the freedom of the phenomenon to give itself as it wishes and it measures the extent to which this freedom turns the tables on the one to whom it appears.

  "Jesus never concealed the fact that his religion included a demand as well as an offer. Indeed, the demand was as total as the offer was free. If he offered men his salvation, he also demanded their submission. He gave no encouragement whatever to thoughtless applicants for discipleship. He brought no pressure to bear on any inquirer. He sent irresponsible enthusiasts away empty. Luke tells of three men who either volunteered, or were invited, to follow Jesus; but no one passed the Lord\u2019s test.

For thousands of people still ignore Christ\u2019s warning and undertake to follow him without first pausing to reflect on the cost of doing so. The result is the great scandal of Christendom today, so called \u201cnominal Christianity.\u201d In countries to which Christian civilization has spread, large numbers of people have covered themselves with a decent, but thin, veneer of Christianity. They have allowed themselves to become somewhat involved, enough to be respectable but not enough to be uncomfortable. Their religion is a great, soft cushion. It protects them from the hard unpleasantness of life, while changing its place and shape to suit their convenience. No wonder the cynics speak of hypocrites in the church and dismiss religion as escapism\u2026The message of Jesus was very different.

Any moment in our lives when we bask in God's mercy and grace is our highest moment. Higher than when we feel smug in our decent performance and cannot think of anything we need to confess... That is potentially a glorious moment. For we could at that moment accept God's abundant Mercy and Grace and go forth with nothing to boast of except Christ Himself, or else we struggle with our shame, focusing on that as well as our track record. We fail because we have shifted our attention from Grace and Mercy. One who draws on God's Mercy and Grace is quick to repent, but also slow to sin.": "Jerry",

But this approach is legalistic, which means living by rules or basing salvation on works. It treats the Bible as a law book, focusing on the letter and looking for loopholes.By contrast, the Bible tells us that we are saved by grace through faith, not by our works (Ephesians 2:8-9).

When the hand conveys bread to the mouth it does not say to the body, 'Thank me; for I feed you.' It is a very simple thing that the hand does though a very necessary thing; and it never arrogates glory to itself for what it does. So God has selected faith to receive the unspeakable gift of His grace, because it cannot take to itself any credit, but must adore the gracious God who is the giver of all good.": "Charles",
  "For the Word of God is not received by faith if it flits about in the top of the brain, but when it takes root in the depth of the heart . . . the heart's distrust is greater than the mind's blindness.

Whatever pale fears and forebodings some of them might have felt before; these were not only now kept out of sight through the growing awe of Ahab, but they were broken up, and on all sides routed, as timid prairie hares that scatter before the bounding bison. The hand of Fate had snatched all their souls; and by the stirring perils of the previous day; the rack of the past night's suspense; the fixed, unfearing, blind, reckless way in which their wild craft went plunging towards its flying mark; by all these things, their hearts were bowled along. The wind that made great bellies of their sails, and rushed the vessel on by arms invisible as irresistible; this seemed the symbol of that unseen agency which so enslaved them to the race.They were one man, not thirty. For as the one ship that held them all; though it was put together of all contrasting things \u2014 oak, and maple, and pine wood; iron, and pitch, and hemp \u2014 yet all these ran into each other in the one concrete hull, which shot on its way, both balanced and directed by the long central keel; even so, all the individualities of the crew, this man's valor, that man's fear; guilt and guiltiness, all varieties were welded into oneness, and were all directed to that fatal goal which Ahab their one lord and keel did point to.The rigging lived. The mast-heads, like the tops of tall palms, were outspreadingly tufted with arms and legs. Clinging to a spar with one hand, some reached forth the other with impatient wavings; others, shading their eyes from the vivid sunlight, sat far out on the rocking yards; all the spars in full bearing of mortals, ready and ripe for their fate.

They danced round the room, slowly, talking very little, with all their attention given to the dance. The room was hot, and their faces shone with sweat. It seemed to Philip that they had thrown off the guard which people wear on their expression, the homage to convention, and he saw them now as they really were. In that moment of abandon they were strangely animal: some were foxy and some were wolflike; and others had the long, foolish face of sheep. Their skins were sallow from the unhealthy life the led and the poor food they ate. Their features were blunted by mean interests, and their little eyes were shifty and cunning. There was nothing of nobility in their bearing, and you felt that for all of them life was a long succession of petty concerns and sordid thoughts. The air was heavy with the musty smell of humanity. But they danced furiously as though impelled by some strange power within them, and it seemed to Philip that they were driven forward by a rage for enjoyment. They were seeking desperately to escape from a world of horror. The desire for pleasure which Cronshaw said was the only motive of human action urged them blindly on, and the very vehemence of the desire seemed to rob it of all pleasure. The were hurried on by a great wind, helplessly, they knew not why and they knew not whither. Fate seemed to tower above them, and they danced as though everlasting darkness were beneath their feet. Their silence was vaguely alarming. It was as if life terrified them and robbed them of power of speech so that the shriek which was in their hearts died at their throats. Their eyes were haggard and grim; and notwithstanding the beastly lust that disfigured them, and the meanness of their faces, and the cruelty, notwithstanding the stupidness which was the worst of all, the anguish of those fixed eyes made all that crowd terrible and pathetic.

In Capricorn we will gain memory, and in Aquarius, vision; it is only in Pisces, the last and oldest of the zodiacal signs, that we acquire a kind of selfhood, something whole.

But when they are at their work they become dogs, wolves, for they are hounds of death, and also hounds of joy. They take the strands of life in their jaws, and sometimes they are careful with their jagged teeth, and sometimes they are not. They gallop around a great monolith, the stone that pierces our Sphere where the meridians meet, that turns the Earth and pins it in place in the world. It is called the Spindle of Necessity, and all round it the wolves of fate run, and run, and run, and the patterns of their winding are the patterns of the world. Nothing can occur without them, but they take no sides. I could also say that there is such a stone, such a place, but the dogs who are women died long ago, and left the strands to fall, and we have been helpless ever since. That in a wolfless world we must find our own way. That is more comforting to me. I want my own way, I want to falter; I want to fail, and I want to be redeemed.

  "There can be no doubt that the chief fault we have developed, through the long course of human evolution, is a certain basic passivity. When provoked by challenges, human beings are magnificent. When life is quiet and even, we take the path of least resistance, and then wonder why we feel bored. A man who is determined and active doesn't pay much attention to 'luck'. If things go badly, he takes a deep breath and redoubles his effort. And he quickly discovers that his moments of deepest happiness often come after such efforts. The man who has become accustomed to a passive existence becomes preoccupied with 'luck'; it may become an obsession. When things go well, he is delighted and good humored; when they go badly, he becomes gloomy and petulant. He is unhappy\u2014or dissatisfied\u2014most of the time, for even when he has no cause for complaint, he feels that gratitude would be premature; things might go wrong at any moment; you can't really trust the world... Gambling is one basic response to this passivity, revealing the obsession with luck, the desire to make things happen.The absurdity about this attitude is that we fail to recognize the active part we play in making life a pleasure. When my will is active, my whole mental and physical being works better, just as my digestion works better if I take exercise between meals. I gain an increasing feeling of control over my life, instead of the feeling of helplessness (what Sartre calls 'contingency') that comes from long periods of passivity. Yet even people who are intelligent enough to recognize this find the habit of passivity so deeply ingrained that they find themselves holding their breath when things go well, hoping fate will continue to be kind.": "Colin",

My attention became fully absorbed by the other faces in the club and the deep anxiety they betrayed to me, an anxiety that was not of the natural, existential sort but one that was caused by peculiar concerns of an uncanny nature. What a season is upon us, these faces seemed to say. And no doubt their voices would have spoken directly of certain peculiar concerns had they not been intimidated into weird equivocations and double entendres by the fear of falling victim to the same kind of unnatural affliction that had made so much trouble in the mind of the art critic Stuart Quisser. Who would be next? What could a person say these days, or even think, without feeling the dread of repercussion from powerfully connected groups and individuals? I could almost hear their voices asking, \"Why here, why now?\" But of course they could have just as easily been asking, \"Why not here, why not now?\" It would not occur to this crowd that there were no special rules involved; it would not occur to them, even though they were a crowd of imaginative artists, that the whole thing was simply a matter of random, purposeless terror that converged upon a particular place at a particular time for no particular reason. On the other hand, it would also not have occurred to them that they might have wished it all upon themselves, that they might have had a hand in bringing certain powerful forces and connections into our district simply by wishing them to come. They might have wished and wished for an unnatural evil to fall upon them but, for a while at least, nothing happened. Then the wishing stopped, the old wishes were forgotten yet at the same time gathered in strength, distilling themselves into a potent formula (who can say!), until one day the terrible season began. Because had they really told the truth, this artistic crowd might also have expressed what a sense of meaning (although of a negative sort), not to mention the vigorous thrill (although of an excruciating type), this season of unnatural evil had brought to their lives.(\"Gas Station Carnivals\")": "Thomas",

Whether you have a piece of bread or not, is an absolute. Whether you eat your bread or see it vanish into a looter's stomach, is an absolute.There are two sides to every issue: one side is right and the other is wrong, but the middle is always evil. The man who is wrong still retains some respect for truth, if only by accepting the responsibility of choice. But the man in the middle is the knave who blanks out the truth in order to pretend that no choice or values exist, who is willing to sit out the course of any battle, willing to cash in on the blood of the innocent or to crawl on his belly to the guilty, who dispenses justice by condemning both the robber and the robbed to jail, who solves conflicts by ordering the thinker and the fool to meet each other halfway.

Some people think they can imagine a creature which was free but had no possibility of going wrong, but I can't. If a thing is free to be good it's also free to be bad. And free will is what has made evil possible. Why, then, did God give them free will? Because free will, though it makes evil possible, is also the only thing that makes possible any love or goodness or joy worth having. A world of automata -of creatures that worked like machines- would hardly be worth creating. The happiness which God designs for His higher creatures is the happiness of being freely, voluntarily united to Him and to each other in an ecstasy of love and delight compared with which the most rapturous love between a man and a woman on this earth is mere milk and water. And for that they've got to be free.Of course God knew what would happen if they used their freedom the wrong way: apparently, He thought it worth the risk. (...) If God thinks this state of war in the universe a price worth paying for free will -that is, for making a real world in which creatures can do real good or harm and something of real importance can happen, instead of a toy world which only moves when He pulls the strings- then we may take it it is worth paying.": "C.S.",

There are various essential attributes of life -- particularly human life -- such as sentience, mobility, awareness, growth, autonomy, will. It is possible to kill or attempt to kill one of these attributes without actually destroying the body. Thus we may \"break\" a horse or even a child without harming a hair on its head. Erich Fromm was acutely sensitive to this fact when he broadened the definition of necrophilia to include the desire of certain people to control others-to make them controllable, to foster their dependency, to discourage their capacity to think for themselves, to diminish their unpredectibility and originalty, to keep them in line. Distinguishing it from a \"biophilic\" person, one who appreciates and fosters the variety of life forms and the uniqueness of the individual, he demonstrated a \"necrophilic character type,\" whose aim it is to avoid the inconvenience of life by transforming others into obedient automatons, robbing them of their humanity.Evil then, for the moment, is the force, residing either inside or outside of human beings, that seeks to kill life or liveliness.

I think this is the only story we have and that it occurs on all levels of feeling and intelligence. Virtue and vice were warp and woof of our first consciousness, and they will be the fabric of our last, and this despite any changes we may impose on field and river and mountain, on economy and manners. there is no other story.

And he was, in some ways, extremely banal. I describe him as looking like a human toothbrush. He was a sort of starch, lean officer with a silly mustache, and a very stupid look to him, but a very fanatical glint as well.

Above all, however, the thesis was advocated-and this even infiltrated Catholic moral theology-that there was no such thing as something that is bad in itself. There were only things that were \"relatively\" bad. What was good or bad depended on the consequences. In such a context, where everything is relative and nothing intrinsically evil exists, but only relative good and relative evil, people who have an inclination to such behavior are left without no solid footing. Of course pedophilia is first rather a sickness of individuals, but the fact that it could become so active and so widespread was linked also to an intellectual climate through which the foundations of moral theology, good and evil, became open to question in the Church.

Yet, he denies or pretends that he does not know the other side of him. He only knows of himself as the protagonist, the righteous, and the honorable one. Others, who do not belong to his fold, are the villains, the devils, and the low-life beings. Ironically, the less he knows of his other self the more he becomes what he derides and denigrates.

I saw those winnowing tentacles come out again, and the front figure pause, and then\u2014it\u2019s the only word that actually describes it\u2014ooze on again on its via dolorosa. And at that the hind figure seemed to summon all its strength. It seemed to open out a fringe of arms or tentacles, a sort of corona of black rays spread out. It gaped with a full expansion, and even I could feel that there was a perfectly horrible attraction, or vacuum drag, being exerted. That was horrible enough, with the face of the super-suffering man now almost under me resonating my own terror. But the worst thing was that, as the tentacles unwrapped and winnowed out toward their prey, I saw they weren\u2019t really tentacles at all. They were spreading cracks, veins, fissures, rents of darkness expanding from a void, a gap of pure blackness. There\u2019s only one way to say it\u2014one was seeing right through the solid world into a gap, an ultimate maelstrom. And from it was spreading out a\u2014I can only call it so\u2014a negative sunrise of black radiation that would deluge and obliterate everything. Of course it was still only a fissure, a vent, but one realized\u2014This is a hole, a widening hole, that has been pierced in the dike that defends the common-sense, sensuous world. Through this vortex-hole that is rapidly opening, over this lip and brink, everything could slip, fall in, find no purchase, be swallowed up.It was like watching a crumbling cliff with survivors clinging to it being undercut and toppling into a black tide that had swallowed up its base. This negative force could drag the solidest things from their base, melt them, engulf the whole hard, visible world. And we were right on that brink. What was after us, for I knew now I was in its field, was not a thing of any passions or desires. Those are limited things, satiable things\u2014in a way, balanced things, and so familiar, safe even, almost friendly in comparison with this.

It is the second strongest thing in the universe, and, indeed, outside that.

  "Providence then - and this is what is most important to grasp - is not the same thing as a universal teleology. To believe in divine and unfailing providence is not to burden one's conscience with the need to see every event in this world not only as an occasion for God's grace, but as a positive determination of God's will whereby he brings to pass a comprehensive design that, in the absence of any single one of these events, would not have been possible. It may seem that this is to draw only the finest of logical distinction, one so fine indeed as to amount to little more than a sophistry. Some theologians - Calvin, for instance - have denied that the distinction between what God wills and what he permits has any meaning at all. And certainly there is no unanimity in the history of Christian exegesis on this matter. Certain classic Western interpretations of Paul's treatment of the hardening of Pharaoh's heart and of the hardened heart of Israel in Romans 9 have taken it as a clear statement of God's immediate determination of his creatures' wills. But in the Eastern Christian tradition, and in the thought of many of the greatest Western theologians, the same argument has often been understood to assert no more than that God in either case allowed a prior corruption of the will to run its course, or even - like a mire in the light of the sun - to harden the outpouring of God's fiery mercy, and always for the sake of a greater good that will perhaps redound even to the benefit of the sinner. One might read Christ's answer to his disciples' question regarding why a man had been born blind - 'that the works of God should be made manifest in him' (John 9:3) - either as a refutation or as a confirmation of the distinction between divine will and permission. When all is said and done, however, not only is the distinction neither illogical nor slight; it is an absolute necessity if - setting aside, as we should, all other judgments as superstitious, stochastic, and secondary - we are to be guided by the full character of what is revealed of God in Christ. For, after all, if it is from Christ that we are to learn how God relates himself to sin, suffering, evil, and death, it would seem that he provides us little evidence of anything other than a regal, relentless, and miraculous enmity: sin he forgives, suffering he heals, evil he casts out, and death he conquers.

  "Being Scared-off by EvilLastly, we deny the presence of evil because we are terri\ufb01ed by the horrendously hurtful, cruel, and bloody kinds of evil people tell us about\u2014if we are willing to listen.

Evil is thus the tendency of a person to live a life that is not \u2018in harmony\u2019 with the rest of the world, but \u2018in opposition\u2019 to it or at best \u2018in indifference\u2019 to it.

  "Thalion continued. \u201cThe human world was very young and the disobedient children of God had just fallen, creating the underworld. Your God because of their desire to be like God forsook them. They craved and desired, the one thing that they should have never wanted, and that was to be as great as their creator. During this time of peace, the supernaturals traveled freely between the realms. We all knew of the fallen, the angels that had become demons, and knew that they were never to be released from the hell in which they had been cast. Their evil was beyond anything that was ever known. The leader of them, Lucifer, had declared war on the human children of God and desired more than anything to take their souls, to drag them to the hell he and his were stuck in for all eternity. All of the supernatural races were warned by an angel of God to never allow the demons from the underworld to escape their own realm. The veil was sealed by the angel and hidden from all.Unfortunately, evil always seems to find more evil. All evil things are drawn to each other, seeking out those who would help them in their cause. Though the veil to the underworld was hidden, the evil beyond it was great and as more and more lost souls were cast there after their deaths, and so the evil grew. It began to permeate the air around the veil such that other beings could detect it. There was no one who knew how to open it, but that didn\u2019t stop them from trying.As the sons of men began to allow evil into their hearts, and as they began to stray farther from their God, they began seeking out other ways to fill the void inside them. They began to worship other beings, or objects. They sought out meanings for their lives in ways that caused darkness to creep into their hearts. God desired men to have free will and he would not force their loyalty to him. Sin was corrupting the world and Lucifer was allowed some control in the human realm. That sin gave Lucifer just the opening he needed to whisper lies into the ears of those who would listen. He pointed them in the direction divinity and sorcery where they learned how to contact the dead. They thought they were contacting loved ones who had passed on, but in reality they were drawing the demon spirits to them and giving them power, so much power that the demons began to be able to manipulate the actions of men and women still living.": "Quinn",

But T.H. White had already considered that paradigm, was indeed rewriting it at the same time as Tolkien in The Once and Future King; and he had seen the core of Malory's work not in romantic vice but in the human urge to murder. In White the poisonous adder that provokes the last disastrous battle is no adder but a harmless grass-snake, and the flash of the sword which brings on the two armies is not natural self-defense but natural blood-lust, creating a continuum from cruelty to animals to world wars and holocausts.

Some will call it vulgar, disgusting, and the rest of it; that is, they will accuse it of a lack of manners. Perhaps it does show a lack of manners; but this is scarcely its most serious disadvantage. Others will talk about the loathsome spectacle and the revolting scene; that is, they will accuse it of a deficiency of art, or \u00e6sthetic beauty.

Another school of thinkers will say that the action is lacking in efficiency: that it is an uneconomic waste of a good grandmother. But that could only depend on the value, which is again an individual matter. The only real point that is worth mentioning is that the action is wicked, because your grandmother has a right not to be beaten to death.

As she ate it, while of course it was still alive, the body split and I remember to this day the sweet pinkness of its roes as they spilled out, much to the delight of the baby otters, who scrambled over themselves to feed on the delicacy. One of nature\u2019s wonders, gentlemen: mother and children dining on mother and children. And that\u2019s when I first learned about evil. It is built into the nature of the universe. Every world spins in pain. If there is any kind of supreme being, I told myself, it is up to all of us to become his moral superior.": "Terry",

  "What is worse than doing evil, is being evil\u201d (Ethics, p.67). To lie is wrong, but what is worse than the lie is the liar, for the liar contaminates everything he says, because everything he says is meant to further a cause that is false. The liar as liar has endorsed a world of falsehood and deception, and to focus only on the truth or falsity of his particular statements is to miss the danger of being caught up in his twisted world. This is why, as Bonhoeffer says, that \u201c(i)t is worse for a liar to tell the truth than for a lover of truth to lie\u201d (Ethics, p.67).": "Dietrich",

This was where the suicide lay; and this was the place where I was, alone - unmanned, shivering with cold in a shroud of snow with a wild storm gathering again upon me!

  "[\"F]or it's not possible,\" [Socrates] said, \"for anybody to experience a greater evil than hating arguments. Hatred of arguments and hatred of human beings come about in the same way. For hatred of human beings arises from artlessly trusting somebody to excess, and believing that human being to be in every way true and sound and trustworthy, and then a little later discovering that this person is wicked and untrustworthy - and then having this experience again with another. And whenever somebody experiences this many times, and especially at the hands of just those he might regard as his most intimate friends and comrades, he then ends up taking offense all the time and hates all human beings and believes there's nothing at all sound in anybody.": "Plato,",

Mainstream Christianity will insist that faith and evidence are inseparable. Indeed, faith is a response to evidence, not a rejoicing in the absence of evidence. The apostle Paul says what many pioneers of modern science believed, that nature itself is part of the evidence for the existence of God ,\u2018 Since the creation of the world, God\u2019s invisible qualities- his eternal power and divine nature \u2013 have been clearly seen, being understood from what has been made.

  "All of nature, therefore, is good, since the Creator of all nature is supremely good. But nature is not supremely and immutably good as is the Creator of it. Thus the good in created things can be diminished and augmented. For good to be diminished is evil; still, however much it is diminished, something must remain of its original nature as long as it exists at all. For no matter what kind or however insignificant a thing may be, the good which is its 'nature' cannot be destroyed without the thing itself being destroyed. There is good reason, therefore, to praise an uncorrupted thing, and if it were indeed an incorruptible thing which could not be destroyed, it would doubtless be all the more worthy of praise. When, however, a thing is corrupted, its corruption is an evil because it is, by just so much, a privation of the good. Where there is no privation of the good, there is no evil. Where there is evil, there is a corresponding diminution of the good. As long, then, as a thing is being corrupted, there is good in it of which it is being deprived; and in this process, if something of its being remains that cannot be further corrupted, this will then be an incorruptible entity [natura incorruptibilis], and to this great good it will have come through the process of corruption. But even if the corruption is not arrested, it still does not cease having some good of which it cannot be further deprived. If, however, the corruption comes to be total and entire, there is no good left either, because it is no longer an entity at all. Wherefore corruption cannot consume the good without also consuming the thing itself. Every actual entity [natura] is therefore good; a greater good if it cannot be corrupted, a lesser good if it can be. Yet only the foolish and unknowing can deny that it is still good even when corrupted. Whenever a thing is consumed by corruption, not even the corruption remains, for it is nothing in itself, having no subsistent being in which to exist.": "Augustine",

  "In this universe, even what is called evil, when it is rightly ordered and kept in its place, commends the good more eminently, since good things yield greater pleasure and praise when compared to the bad things. For the Omnipotent God, whom even the heathen acknowledge as the Supreme Power over all, would not allow any evil in his works, unless in his omnipotence and goodness, as the Supreme Good, he is able to bring forth good out of evil. What, after all, is anything we call evil except the privation of good? In animal bodies, for instance, sickness and wounds are nothing but the privation of health. When a cure is effected, the evils which were present (i.e., the sickness and the wounds) do not retreat and go elsewhere. Rather, they simply do not exist any more. For such evil is not a substance; the wound or the disease is a defect of the bodily substance which, as a substance, is good. Evil, then, is an accident, i.e., a privation of that good which is called health. Thus, whatever defects there are in a soul are privations of a natural good. When a cure takes place, they are not transferred elsewhere but, since they are no longer present in the state of health, they no longer exist at all.": "Augustine",

  "In the Garden story, good and evil are found on the same tree, not in separate orchards. Good and evil give meaning and definition to each other. If God, like us, is susceptible to immense pain, He is, like us, the greater in His capacity for happiness. The presence of such pain serves the larger purpose of God's master plan, which is to maximize the capacity for joy, or in other words, \"to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man.\" He can no more foster those ends in the absence of suffering and evil than one could find the traction to run or the breath to sing in the vacuum of space.

Free assent to the good never exists simply by itself. If there were structures which could irrevocably guarantee a determined and good state of the world, man's freedom would be denied, and hence they would not be good structures at all.": "Pope",

  "Evil then consists not in being created but in the rebellious idolatry by which humans worship and honour elements of the natural world rather than the God who made them.

Tempests, because sensual lust is a tempest - worse than a tempest! Beauty is a terrible and awful thing! It is terrible because it has not been fathomed and never can be fathomed, for God sets before us nothing but riddles. Here the boundaries meet and all contradictions exist side by side. I am not an educated nor cultured man, Alyosha, but I've thought a lot about this. It's terrible what mysteries there are! Too many riddles weigh men down on earth. We must solve as we can, and try to keep a dry skin in the water. Beauty! I can't bear the thought that a man of lofty mind and heart begins with the ideal of the Madonna and ends with the ideal of Sodom. What's still more awful is that a man with the ideal of Sodom in his soul does not renounce the ideal of the Madonna, and his heart may be on fire with that ideal, genuinely on fire, just as in his days of youth and innocence. Yes, man is broad, too broad. I'd have him narrower. The devil only knows what to make of it! What to the mind is shameful is beauty and nothing else to the heart. Is there beauty in Sodom? Believe me, that for the immense mass of mankind beauty is found in Sodom. Did you know that secret? The awful thing is that beauty is mysterious as well as terrible.

  "Within biblical theology it remains the case that the one living God created a world that is other than himself, not contained within himself. Creation was from the beginning an act of love, of affirming goodness of the other. God saw all that he had made, and it was very good; but it was not itself divine. At its height, which according to Genesis 1 is the creation of humans, it was designed to REFLECT God, both to reflect God back to God in worship and to reflect God into the rest of creation in stewardship. But this image-bearing capacity of humankind is not in itself the same thing as divinity. Collapsing this distinction means taking a large step toward a pantheism within which there is no way of understanding, let alone addressing, the problem of evil.": "N.T.",

They know the truth and are not in any denial about it!!! It's harsh, yes! However, it is Real and a danger to those in Israel. This is not my first rodeo!!! Combat brings me no joy!!!

I ran all over the island, into all sorts of queer little places that I never knew were there before - it seems so different after dark - and finally, when two or three times I'd been so tired that I thought I just couldn't go any farther, before he caught me, I saw the house in front of me and the front door still open and I started to run in, and then I thought - what if they'd planned it that way, and Aunt Sarai had come down from her portrait and was inside there in the dark, waiting for me?": "Evangeline",
  "Five actors playing allotted parts on a set stage; and now he, for whom no part had been written, had walked onto the stage unexpectedly, because one of the players had turned rebel, as she had once before. He threw everything out of focus, and them into a fever. The heat and intensity of these flying questions was enough to make a man with even partially trained clairvoyant faculties feel as if he sat in a room filled with flashing fireflies.He took warning and withdrew himself to a cold inner isolation, as he knew how to do, even while laughing and talking with surface ease. It would not do to let his mind become clouded with emotion; or open any door of his imagination. But the impressions that came across that safer inner distance did not make his companions seem less dramatic, more normal: they were still out of focus. Something about the picture was distorted, even to a clear vision. The sense of evil was as strong as ever although the lurking Presence seemed to have retreated into a far background.He saw presently what the distortion was.Their modern figures were somehow incongruous in the old house, not at home. Like actors who had somehow got onto the wrong stage, onto sets with which their voices and costumes clashed. Interlopers. Or else-actors of an old school dressed up in an unbecoming masquerade.Witch House was an old house. Not old as other houses are old, that remain beds of the continuous stream of life, of marriages and births and deaths, of children crying and children laughing, where the past is only part of the pattern, root of the present and the future.

Thoughts are tangible things; on their own plane they breed like germs and, unlike germs, they do not die.

  "I love you, Gideon.\u201d\u201cGod.\u201d He looked at me with something that resembled disgust. Whether it was directed at me or himself, I didn\u2019t know. \u201cHow can you say that?\u201d\u201cBecause it\u2019s the truth.\u201d\u201cYou just see this\u201d\u2014he gestured at himself with a wave of his hand. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing the fucked-up, broken mess inside.\u201dI inhaled sharply. \u201cYou can say that to me? When you know I\u2019m fucked up and broken, too?": "Sylvia",
  "You definitely have the voice for phone sex, but I've got to go. I have a date with my vibrator.\"\"Oh, Eva.\" Cross spoke my name in a decadent purr. \"You're determined to drive me to my knees, aren't you? What will it take to talk you into a threesome with B.O.B.": "Sylvia",
  "Sex that's planned like a business transaction is a turnoff for me..... Listen to yourself. Why even call it a fuck? Why not be clear and call it a seminal emission in a pre-approved orifice?\" (Eva to Gideon)": "Sylvia",
  "Don't. Tell me when, then. And before you say never, take a good look at me and tell me if you see a man who's easily deterred.": "Sylvia",
  "I had never seen hair that purely black. It was glossy and slightly long, the ends drifting over his collar. That sexy length was the crowning touch of bad boy hotness over the successful businessman, like whipped cream topping on a hot fudge brownie sundae. As my mother would say, only rogues and raiders had hair like that.\" (Eva about Gideon)": "Sylvia",
  "Don't you dare touch yourself today. I want your orgasm and I plan on getting it later.": "T.K.",
  "There is something immensely scary about putting yourself out there for people to love or hate you, fan or pan you, review or screw you.": "L.V.",
  "Tate?\" \"What?\" he barked at him. Logan couldn't help the way his dick reacted to it. \"I can't even remember what he looks like because all I can picture is you.": "Ella",
  "She tries to wear her pain on the inside. She always has. It\u2019s the trademark of the oldest sibling, I think.": "Laura",
  "Logan ran a hand through his hair as he tried to calm his racing heart. He wanted her on the most basic level that a man could want a woman, but it was so much more than that. It wasn\u2019t just about sex and the need to be inside her so badly it hurt\u2014it was all the other stuff to. The need to matter. The need to be selfless. \tThe need to love.": "Juliana",
  "..then he pushed the call button again and asked, \"Are you sleeping with anyone?\"\"Why is that any business of yours?\"\"Because I want to fuck you, Eva. I need to know what's standing in my way, if anything.": "Sylvia",
  "As he stared back, he altered...as if a shield slid away fro his eyes, revealing a scorching force of will that sucked the air from my lungs. The intense magnetism he exuded grew in strength, becoming a near tangible impression of vibrant and unrelenting power.": "Sylvia",
  "Cary rocked back on his heels and twirled one index finger around another in a sign meaning, wrapped around your fi": "Sylvia",
  "I was crying on the back-porch swing. You came out with a corsage of fresh forget-me-nots and roses, and a handkerchief. You told me any guy worth my time would always come to me with flowers and a handkerchief. One to make me smile, and the other to dry my tears, because a smart guy knows women need to cry as much as they need to laugh.": "Joey",
  "I mean this is the kind of love people dream about, poets write sonnets for, and well it's the kind of love that keeps people from losing faith in humanity and encourages people to believe that true love still exists and it's still powerful and still wonderful. (Quote from a reviewer of Loving Lily Lavender)": "DeAnna",
  "Zane,\" she moaned. \"Please touch me.\"\"I will. I'm going to touch every inch of you until I know what makes you sigh and what makes you giggle and what makes you beg me to never stop. I'm going to make you shudder and scream so that long after tonight you'll remember the feel of my hands and exactly where they were on your body.\"\"I'm going to die if you don't get on with it.": "Robin",
  "Mom was silent for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Melissa, but can you blame me for worrying? In less than an hour I found out you\u2019re being stalked by a killer, sleeping with a stranger, and hiding with him in an empty apartment. You have to admit that sounds\u2026unsettling.": "Robin",
  "I\u2019ve never quite mastered the art of holding my liquor,\u201d she replied. He watched her root around in her purse a moment, before pulling out a tube of lip balm.As Jonas watched her apply it, he nearly got distracted from her answer. Leaning forward, Jonas murmured, \u201cCan\u2019t hold your liquor, huh?\u201dShe replaced the cap and dropped it back into her purse. \u201cNot so much. I tend to get a bit too happy.\u201dHis eyebrows shot up and his cock came to full-alert status. Happy--he liked the sound of that. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a bad thing?\u201dTo his utter shock, Deanna blushed. \u201cIn my case it is.\u201dCuriosity got the better of him. \u201cCare to explain?\u201dThe waiter returned with the check, forcing Jonas to drop the conversation while he fished out his credit card. Once they were alone again, Jonas waited, hoping Deanna would go into more detail. She didn\u2019t disappoint him. \u201cAll my inhibitions disappear. It\u2019s not a comfortable feeling for me.\u201dShe was killing him. An immediate picture of a carefree Deanna sprang to mind. He liked it a hell of a lot. \u201cMost people enjoy letting it all hang out every once in a while. Taking life too seriously leads to an early grave.\u201d \u201cMaybe, but if I suddenly develop the urge, I\u2019d rather be coherent.\u201d\u201cYou don\u2019t like to give up control,\u201d he surmised.She cocked her head to the side, as if unsure how to respond at first. \u201cIt\u2019s not that,\u201d she said. \u201cI guess if I\u2019m in the mood to go romping naked through a forest, for example, then I don\u2019t want alcohol to blur the memorable event for me.\u201d She laughed. \u201cI mean, I\u2019d want to remember a crazy moment like that. Wouldn\u2019t you?\u201dNo doubt about it, Jonas liked the way the lady\u2019s mind worked. \u201cYou had me at \u2018running naked\u2019.\u201d Deanna snorted. \u201cYou need serious help.": "Anne",
  "Trouble was, everyone always made talking out a problem sound like it was so simple and solved everything, but actually doing it, and securing the desired outcome without screwing up, seemed about as easy as rowing upriver with a teaspoon.": "Babette",
  "I underestimated your laziness.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s pronounced intelligence, Kirk.": "Abria",
  "You know, you\u2019re kind of a badass.\u201d \u201cPlease, if I had balls they\u2019d be bigger than yours.": "Abria",
  "Why am I surrounded by sluts and morons?": "Abria",
  "There's something about a cowboy...": "Kathleen",
  "You have a certain charm, believe it or not. That, and you feed me.": "Abria",
  "Our evening-long tango of stares had my head spinning.": "Jennifer",
  "I solved world hunger.\u201d\u2028\u201cYeah, right.\u201d\u2028\u201cOh, ye of little faith.\u201d\u2028\u201cYou realize that solving world hunger would mean you\u2019d be doing something good for a change?\u201d\u2028\u201cAh, but there\u2019s the kicker: I destroyed my solutions.\u201d He finally looks away from the window and gives me this cocky smirk. \u201cMalevolence 101, Kirk.": "Abria",
  "I\u2019m going to kill you, you know.": "Abria",
  "Life, Jersey Girl, sometimes pauses. It stops. Sometimes we don\u2019t even realize how everything around us is moving so quickly while we\u2019re standing in the middle of it, allowing it to pass us by. Most of us, if not all, just lose the why. Some of us never figure it out to begin with. We lose sight of the purpose that wakes us up every morning and pushes our day forward. We lose a sense of hope and the feeling of life in general. We view life as more of a test, one that\u2019s trying to beat us down every day.": "E.L.",
  "I have to tell you hon, I don't mind a little teasing now and then, but I'm no masochist and I'm sure as hell no saint...here lately, being around you is agony.": "Jackson",
  "All pomp and show.\u201d Anjali\u2019s glare at the house would\u2019ve exploded bricks if she\u2019d had superhuman powers. \u201cA fat cow needs a big barn.": "Nicola",
  "You know, typically a nickname is shorter than the given name.\u201d\u201cIs it?\u201d he asked in mock seriousness. \u201cOh. Well, tell you what, you can call me\u2026\u201dShe waited several beats, thinking of more than a few unkind examples. \u201cI can call you what?\u201d she finally asked.\u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d He shot her his bone-melting smile. \u201cYou can just call me. Anytime.\u201dShe rolled her eyes, refusing to give in to the smile that threatened. \u201cThat sounds like a line from one of your movies.\u201dHe shot her a triumphant look. \u201cAh, ha! I knew you were a fan.": "Jennifer",
  "It was your choice to sleep with her Gavin! It didn't just happen!": "Belinda",
  "Wade sighed. \u201cI\u2019ll never understand why women wear bras to start with. They look uncomfortable as hell.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not that bad.\u201d\u201cTurn around so I can fasten the damn thing for you.\u201dShe refused to let go. Suddenly it seemed important to do this one small task alone. \u201cI can do it, Wade. I need to get used to doing things with this cast.\u201dHe crossed his arms over his chest as he watched her struggle. \u201cIs it so hard to ask for help from me, Gracie?\u201dShe tried the two small hooks once more, but failed to get them both attached. \u201cNo, it\u2019s just that I\u2019m not used to people offering, I guess.\u201dHe moved around her and helped fasten the contrary hook. When she turned to tell him thanks, he placed his finger over her lips and murmured, \u201cIf you thank me, I\u2019ll spank you. Knowing I haven\u2019t been able to catch your stalker, that he broke into your home and trashed your things and I wasn\u2019t able to stop him makes me feel as fucking useless as tits on a bull. The least I can do is fasten your bra.": "Anne",
  "After all, Sergios was not all bad. He was tough, ruthless, arrogant and selfish, but while he might have the morals of an alley cat, he had been remarkably kind to her mother.": "Lynne",
  "True love propels a person to great feats all without so much as a word.": "Joel",
  "Arrr, shiver me timbers,\u201d he said in an exaggerated pirate twang. He winked his uncovered eye and hooked his thumbs in his pants. \u201cThis is the nicest your mom\u2019s been to a poor old bloke like me-self in days.\u201dSandra poked a finger in his chest, but grinned. \u201cDon\u2019t make me regret it, or you\u2019ll walk the plank.\u201dHe grinned back and, with that eye patch, turned knee-meltingly rakish in under ten seconds flat. \u201cAye, I won\u2019t be asking you to make me Roger jolly, if that\u2019s what has you worrying.": "Jennifer",
  "Rumor has it: when you marry a Walsh you are set for life. Only one thing can screw it up.": "Jessica",
  "And this title, retired Major Ryland, gives you authority over my MasterCard?": "Billi",
  "Housework, if you do it right, will kill you. - Erma Bombeck": "Lynn",
  "Do not, she urged her inner vixen, look at the way those blue jeans fit his lean legs. Do not notice how he\u2019s filled out in all the right places.": "Scarlett",
  "Look at you\u2026 You\u2019re perfect.\"\"Not\u2026 perfect.\"\"Perfect to me\u2026": "Jill",
  "We all have horrible track records,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s what leads up to the real thing. It\u2019s what allows you to recognize it when it shows up.": "Jill",
  "At the unexpected sight of Spence, Colbie startled hard. How was it that he was the one who needed glasses and yet she\u2019d not seen him standing against the window? \u201cNo, I don\u2019t kill a lot of people,\u201d she said cautiously because she was wearing only a towelin front of a strange man. \u201cBut I\u2019m happy to make an exception.\u201dHe laughed, a rough rumble that was more than a little contagious but she controlled herself because, hello, she was once again dripping wet before the man who seemed to make her knees forget to hold her up.\u201cI didn\u2019t mean to scare you,\u201d he said and pushed off the wall to come close.She froze, but he held up his hands like, I come in peace, and crouched at her feet to scoop up the clothes she hadn\u2019t realized she\u2019d dropped.Leggings, a long forgiving tee, and the peach silk bra-and-panty set that hadn\u2019t gotten so much as a blink from the TSA guy.But it got one out of Spence. He also swallowed hard as she snatched them back from him.\u201cHold on,\u201d he said and caught her arm, pulling it toward him to look at her bleeding elbow.\u201cSit,\u201d he said and gently pushed her down to a weight bench. He vanished into the bathroom and came back out with a first aid kit.It took him less than two minutes to clean and bandage the scrape. Then, easily balanced at her side on the balls of his feet, he did the same for both her knees, which she hadn\u2019t noticed were also scraped up.\u201cYou must\u2019ve hit the brick coping as you fell in the fountain,\u201d he said and let his thumb slide over the skin just above one bandaged knee.She shivered, and not from the cold either. \u201cNot going to kiss it better?\u201d she heard herself ask before biting her tongue for running away with her good sense.She\u2019d raised her younger twin brothers. Scrappy, roughhouse wild animals, the both of them, so there\u2019d been plenty of injuries she\u2019d kissed over the years.But no one had ever kissed hers. Not surprising, since most of her injuries tended to be on the inside, where they didn\u2019t show. Still, she was horrified she\u2019d said anything at all. \u201cI didn\u2019t mean\u2014\u201dShe broke off, frozen like a deer in the headlights as Spence slowly lowered his head, brushing his lips over the Band-Aid on her elbow, then her knees. When he lifted his head, he pushed his glasses higher on his nose, those whiskey eyes warm and amused behind his lenses. \u201cBetter?\u201dShockingly better. Since she didn\u2019t quite trust her voice at the moment, she gave a jerky nod and took her clothes back into the bathroom. She shut the door and then leaned against it, letting out a slow, deliberate breath. Holy cow, she was out of her league. He was somehow both cute and hot, and those glasses .": "Jill",
  "Head to toe, Ben pressed up against her, and Darcy wanted to rub along him.There wasn\u2019t room for her to move.Her back was against the cabinet and counter, and Ben was all over her front.Would it be wrong to purr? She wondered.": "Samantha",
  "Are you telling me there is something better out there than icing in a can? Because I\u2019m finding it hard to believe. That\u2019s been my dirty little secret for years.\u201d\tIn a move he didn\u2019t see coming, she chuckled and then shifted to straddle him until they were chest to chest. \u201cThat\u2019s your dirty little secret?\u201d She shook her head. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to work on that.": "Samantha",
  "Her fingertips dug into his shoulders as she pressed closer. Then her lips parted to his, and there was no mistaking the passion in her response.\tWild and sweet\u2026\tHis eyes were closed, but in his mind\u2019s eye he saw the lights of the giant tree, and he knew he\u2019d found a Christmas memory worth keeping.": "Sierra",
  "She\u2019s beautiful. Her responsiveness is intoxicating. I have to have this woman.": "D.L.",
  "Do you want to play a game?\u201d he asks, his tone rich and dark and sensuous like his chocolate. Every atom in me stands at attention. \u201cWhat kind of game?\u201d\u201cWe\u2019ll call it \u2018Sir Says\u2019. The rules are very simple\u2014I give you a command. . . and you obey.": "D.L.",

  "One kiss changed my life. Dibs on the rest of yours. ~Daniel": "Melanie",
  "He felt lightheaded, almost dizzy, as he deepened the kiss, his fingers curling lightly around the tendrils of her hair. His other arm encircled her waist, pressing her closer, and for a moment he went for broke, kissing her with everything he had.\tAnd now that he knew he wasn\u2019t going to get his face slapped, he slowed down to take his time and do it right. The outside world simply ceased to exist. There was only Chloe, warm in his embrace, as her lips responded to his.": "Sierra",

  "When do you leave?\u201d she asked.\tHis fingers paused. \u201cLabor Day weekend.\u201d\tSo soon. Only two and a half weeks away. She nodded, going for a joke. \u201cGood.

I\u2019m already counting down the minutes until I can make my escape from this room.\u201d\t\u201cIt\u2019s your room.": "Julie",

  "So you\u2019re saying the ball\u2019s in my court.\u201d\tHe bent his head, stopping just before his mouth touched hers. \u201cThe ball has always been in your court, Jessica,\u201d he said huskily. \u201cFrom the first moment I walked up to you at the Academy.\u201d\tShe looked at him for a moment. Then she stood up on her tiptoes and leaned into him.\tThe instant her lips touched his, John slid one hand to her waist and threaded the other in her hair.\tAbout damn time.": "Julie",
  "She wanted this man with an intensity that defied logic. Which was part of the reason she\u2019d been ignoring him. A girl only had so much self-control when faced with all this deliciousness.": "Katie",

  "We\u2019ll try to be more sympathetic to your hot nemesis problem. Is she a nightmare to work with?\u201d\tAn image popped into John\u2019s head, of him kissing Jessica against the hotel room wall in Jacksonville.

  "Since you\u2019re obviously in need of something to do, instead of shouting at me through this whole drill, isn\u2019t there some tree you could fell with your bare hands, or a boulder somewhere that needs tossing?": "Julie",

  "So you don't do one night stands. And you're not looking for a boyfriend, or a husband. What do you want, Reina?\u201d I swallowed, my throat suddenly dry. How could one sentence strike with the force of a lightning bolt? \u201cHow about you make me an offer?": "Tara",
  "I offered my most enticing smile, the one I\u2019d been perfecting for years. Sincere and encouraging, it brimmed with counterfeit confidence. My smile had earned me forgiveness when I deserved none, a seat in first class though I\u2019d only paid for coach.": "Tara",

He had yet to even ask, and he shouldn\u2019t. Washington was unforgiving in many matters and getting involved with a nineteen year-old would prove fatal.

  "He turned his head to look at her, trying to think of ways to plead his case. Some way to dazzle and beguile her and make her glad that it was him she was here with. Something witty and persuasive, but she turned at precisely the same moment he did, with invitation in her eyes, and all he could come up with was, \u201cDamn, I really want to kiss you.\u201d Her hesitation was a mere fraction of a second. \u201cMe too,\u201d she whispered. It was all he needed to hear, and in an instant she was in his arms. He kissed her, hard, with no prelude, no artful negotiations or seductive machinations. Just hungry kisses that sent his mind spinning and his body following. She kissed him back with equal enthusiasm, with one hand on his chest and the other wrapped tightly around the back of his neck, pulling him closer. Her mouth was sweet, as sweet as he\u2019d imagined, with lips so soft he could have fallen over the edge of that lighthouse and thought the sensation was just from her touch.": "Tracy",

  "Just one more?\u201d he said, holding up his thumb and index finger to indicate tiny. Oh so small. \u201cJust one more little one? I don\u2019t think that was my best work, and what if this is the only time we ever kiss? Then you\u2019ll go on for the rest of your life thinking that\u2019s the best I can do. I don\u2019t think my ego can take that.\u201d He sure as hell hoped this wouldn\u2019t be the only time they ever kissed. In fact, he was going to make damn sure of it, and then some.

  "He was sort of Kimmie\u2019s boss. And he wasn\u2019t just a thorn in General Mom\u2019s side \u2013 he was a whole stinking rosebush. If the rosebush were six feet of hunky, cake-blaspheming, rich playboy.": "Jamie",
  "If my mom sees you here, she\u2019ll ---\u201c\t\u201cPaper the walls with my innards while the innocents watch?": "Jamie",
  "But he knew how to kiss a woman until she needed his kisses more than she needed to breathe. Until her bones melted. Until she gave him exactly what he wanted.": "Jamie",
  "Is he nice?\u201d one whispered over her gum paste roses for this weekend\u2019s wedding cakes.\t\u201cUm, obviously,\u201d Kimmie said.\t\u201cYou\u2019re why he\u2019s always coming around? I know he\u2019s hot stuff in Chicago, but he always seems so stiff when he comes here,\u201d another added from the sink.\t\u201cHoney, you want them stiff,\u201d a third said\u2026": "Jamie",
  "Right on time, sugar.\u201d Josh draped his arm around her shoulders and steered her through the lobby. \u201cTraffic okay?\u201d\t\u201cYeah, except when that alien spaceship landed on I-90 and then all those crickets jumped out to perform Beethoven\u2019s Fifth on kazoos. Otherwise, clear sailing.": "Jamie",
  "Are those the Edible Undies cupcakes?\u201d one of the women in the kitchen asked.\t\u201cThey\u2019re the Nipple Lickers,\u201d Kimmie answered. \u201cWithout the nipples.\u201d\t\u201cI heard you perfected the Sex on a Peach cupcakes,\u201d another feminine voice said.\t\u201cCan you squeeze me in for a double order of Spank Me Strawberries the weekend before Knot Fest?": "Jamie",

  "I want more than last night. I want you.": "Donna",
  "Nat,\u201d he whispered and lowered his head.\tHer heart missed a beat as his soft mouth brushed against hers. Then his lips were atop hers, firmly, his tongue sliding against them.": "Donna",
  "Look at me, Nat. I won\u2019t bite.\u201d\tThere was a long pause before he said, \u201cHard.": "Donna",
  "He leaned in close, his mouth near her ear. \u201cDance with me.": "Donna",
  "You can\u2019t change the past. It\u2019s already done. Looking back only keeps you there.": "Donna",
  "Sometimes you can miss out on something amazing by being in a hurry.": "Samantha",
  "He was a living, breathing fantasy. Her own rock and roll fantasy at that! And every minute of every day it was getting more and more difficult to ignore the attraction brewing between them.": "Samantha",
  "He still had the problem with getting the album finished. Now was definitely not the time to be messing around with a reporter or a woman. And now he had both those things rolled into one glorious package. He just hoped he survived them both.": "Samantha",
  "With this one kiss it was possible Riley Shaughnessy had ruined her for any other man. She\u2019d dated plenty in her life, but no one had ever kissed her like this. And she had a feeling no one else ever would.": "Samantha",
  "Brace yourself, Savannah Daly. I\u2019m taking you home to meet the family.": "Samantha",
  "Ladies, ladies, ladies,\u201d Hugh Shaughnessy said as he strode into the room with his son in his arms. \u201cThere is plenty of this baby \u2013 and his poop \u2013 to go around.": "Samantha",
  "I\u2019m here for your pants and shoes.": "Robin",
  "Sweetheart, for you, I\u2019d share whatever you asked.": "Samantha",

  "Her eyes widened as he stalked her from across the kitchen.\t\u201cThere is no way I can ignore you \u2013 it\u2019s impossible. Just like it would be impossible to stop breathing.\u201d And then, because he figured they were already fighting, he might as well poke the bear a little more. So he grabbed her and kissed her. Hard. Wet. And wild.": "Samantha",
  "What is it you want, Savannah?\u201d His voice was so low it was almost a growl.\tShe looked up at his face finally as she licked her lips. He was going to make her say the words \u2013 to tell him why she was up here, knocking on his door and ogling him like the world\u2019s greatest treat.\t\u201cYou,\u201d she said, her voice barely audible.": "Samantha",
  "That was the hottest haircut ever.": "Samantha",
  "Baby, the tumbleweeds can wait.": "Samantha",

  "Man.": "Motorcyle.",
  "She wasn\u2019t the only one with an eye for sexy men \u2013 especially ones licking ice cream.": "Tracy",
  "I\u2019m not gone.\u201d He pulled her close and whispered in her ear, \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got tonight.": "Tracy",
  "But your perfectly good bed doesn\u2019t come with a blanket of stars.": "Tracy",
  "Collin\u2019s playful look turned serious, and he stood, took Ellie\u2019s hand, and eased her up to join him. He pulled her into his arms, pressed her close against his hard body, and swayed to the music. Combing his fingers through her hair, he swept it away from her ear, and whispered huskily, \u201cThis feels right.": "Tracy",
  "You sing?\u201d she asked.\t\u201cMostly in the shower.\u201d\t\u201cThen I should\u2019ve had my ear to the bathroom door when you were in there.\u201d\tHe pinched the beads at the end of the tie on her blouse, and rolled them between his fingertips. \u201cYou should\u2019ve been in there with me.": "Tracy",
  "You\u2019re the kind of girl who deserves way more than a one-night stand.": "Tracy",
  "I don\u2019t think I\u2019d feel any more violated if he\u2019d stripped me bare. I might as well have lain down before him openly exposing all my flaws and my fears, inviting him to psychoanalyze me.": "Siobhan",
  "I was wrong last night. Kyler isn\u2019t just trouble. He\u2019s an apocalypse-level disaster waiting to happen. I need to find some fallout shelter to hide in. And quick.": "Siobhan",
  "He knows I\u2019ve seen something in him. Something I recognize, only because it exists in me too.": "Siobhan",
  "This whole scenario is sick, depraved, but also grossly fascinating. I\u2019ve become a Peeping Tom. And. It\u2019s. Turning. Me. On.": "Siobhan",
  "What is that?\u201d Addison inspects the food with a look of sheer revulsion on her face. You\u2019d swear I just handed her a plate full of arsenic. \u201cThe Works Burger with fries and extra onions and cheese, exactly as you ordered.\u201d I keep my voice level.She sends me a scathing look. \u201cDo I look like I\u2019d ever consume that amount of saturated fat?": "Siobhan",
  "And sometimes when I feel that much emotion, something inside of me just snaps.": "Colleen",
  "It was right that she was now staying at the ranch. She belonged there.": "She",
  "You don\u2019t put pressure on me to be something I\u2019m incapable of being. You accept me exactly how I am.": "Colleen",
  "And when you love someone, seeing them sad also makes you sad.": "Colleen",

  "One side of his lips quirked up in a sexy smirk. \u201cGot a cure forthat frustration you got going on,\u201d he said.\u201cGot a cure for your ego?": "Jamie",
  "What, was there something special in your ice cream?\u201d he said like an ass.\u201cEstrogen,\u201d she said. \u201cYou might notice some swelling in your boobs and shrinkage in your package for a few days.": "Jamie",

  "I can almost feel the wind beneath my wings": "I",
  "I am so not kissing you tonight,\u201d she informed him.He chuckled softly. And if she thought his smile wasdangerous, his chuckle should\u2019ve been classified as a biologicalweapon. Sin in a sound wave.\u201cBut now you\u2019re thinking about what it would be like, ain\u2019tyou?\u201d he said.\u201cOnly my stupid parts.": "Jamie",
  "He looked up from the paper he was scribbling on and offeredher a lopsided grin. \u201cHey, sweet pea. You bring me anythingspecial?\u201dThe lopsided bit wasn\u2019t odd, but there was something forcedabout it. \u201cGot a fresh bag of cat food outside.\u201d Cat food that she\u2019dbought with the twenty he\u2019d left to pay for his ice cream.He pushed his makeshift drum set aside and rose with astretch. \u201cWords every man dreams of hearing. Make my night ifyou say you got catnip too.\u201dShe tried not to giggle. She tried hard.But she couldn\u2019t help herself. \u201cExtra strength,\u201d she said.This time, his grin came out bigger, less forced. \u201cWoman ofmy dreams.\u201d\u201cIn your dreams,\u201d she said.": "Jamie",

His last song.Every song in between.": "Jamie",
  "That was his biggest regret. He loved playing for aliving, loved hearing his songs on the radio, loved being on a stage and the road, but some days, he wouldn\u2019t have minded going home every night to a sweet wife and a couple babies and fried chicken on the table. That was what Lindsey had taken from him. He\u2019d fallen hard.

  "It is utterly unfair,\u201d she said, shooing Wrigley away andtossing aside her blanket, \u201cthat your country boy smile isn\u2019tillegal.\u201d She pulled her feet from beneath him, but then she swung a leg over him and straddled his lap, still smiling at him while she took his cheeks in her hands and pressed a soft, open-lipped kiss to his mouth.Will\u2019s pulse kicked up the tempo. He gripped her hips andpushed against her, parted his lips to make way for her tongue.Music exploded inside him. Electric guitars, keyboard, fiddle,bongos. No words, just the white-hot melody of their bodies.The intoxicating scent of her shampoo tickled his nose, but the intrigued woman scent was stronger\u2014heady and spicy and everything.He wanted her.": "Jamie",
  "She was his, but she wasn\u2019t.I don\u2019t do love, she\u2019d said.But with her, he didn\u2019t know any other way. Even when hewanted to protect himself, he knew.

  "Ronan sucked in a deep breath, forcing himself not to look at her. If he did, he would want to kiss her again. That was all he could think about. Tasting her, drinking from her, and finding out if he made her half as crazy as she made him.": "Sara",

  "Once we set our sights on something we want,\" Ronan rasped, \"we don't quit until we get it.\" She wasn't sure if he bent to her or she reached for him, but the end result was explosive. Ronan's mouth covered hers, and with a strangled groan, she opened to him immediately. His tongue sought entrance and lashed along hers with swift, furious strokes. Maddy's arms tightened around his neck as she met his greedy kiss with one of her own. Devoured - that's how she felt - and she couldn't get enough.": "Sara",

  "Lindsay strode to the door and picked up his overcoat from the back of the couch, where he'd tossed it when they came in.

He was looking up.\tAt the mistletoe, directly over their heads.\tHe met her eyes with a look that glimmered with promise. Then he took the overcoat from her hand and tossed it, lightly, onto the back of the sofa once again.\tEverything seemed to slow. His intentions were clear, and she had plenty of time to step back.

  "He might kiss like a damn sex god and rev her engine like no other, but he clearly wasn't for her.": "Carrie",

  "I'm a poet who has lost his words.\" He looks across the street, but not before I catch the dull glint of shame in his eyes.\"Where did you lose them?\" I ask, gentling my tone.He turns back to me.

  "Ronan tightened his grip before leaning over and whispering, \"Do you have any idea how much I want you?": "Sara",
  "I'm terrified that if I let myself go there again, if I explore these out-of-control emotions, that there will be no turning back. It's like looking into a giant abyss. There's no end in sight. There's no bottom to the well, and if I allow myself to fall in...\"\"He'll catch you,\" Jordan whispered. \"But you have to trust him, and you have to trust in yourself. That's love, my friend - leaping into the mighty unknown because your heart overtakes your mind. That's what life is all about, but we can't and don't do it alone. Give Ronan a chance, Maddy.": "Sara",
  "I try not to react, but I must fail because Gabriel turns to look at me. \u201cThe world needs both butterflies and lions. One is not better than the other. They're both beautiful and brave in their own ways.\u201dHis hand covers mine as it fiddles with the blades of grass. \u201cAva.\u201d I look up. \u201cI do not wish you were a lion any more than I would have wished her to be a butterfly.": "A.J.",
  "Weren't you the guy who said he'd settle for one woman when hell froze over?\"\"I did say that, didn't I?\"\"Yeah, a bunch of times,\" Gavin's smile faded.": "Sara",
  "You know who should watch out?\" Imogene lowered her voice to a conspiratorial whisper.\"Gavin's brothers. Mmm-hmm. Now that Gavin is tying the knot, Carolyn has a bee in her bonnet about getting all her other boys married off.": "Sara",
  "If you think Thanksgiving has been fun, just wait until Christmas.\"...The doors slammed shut with a muffled thud, and all he could think about was the revenge she could be planning. He'd never looked forward to anything more in his life. \"Game on.": "Sara",
  "Ronan cupped her neck with his other hand and brushed his lips lightly over hers. \"I want you, Maddy. I want you more than I've ever wanted any woman in my life.": "Sara",
  "He couldn't suppress the grin that curves his lips. \"In fact, I'm the only man who belongs in your bed from now on.": "Sara",
  "I'm still a little hungry.\" She shot a sly glance at Ronan before tangling her fingers in his. \"Not quite sure what I want, though.\"\"Could've fooled me,\" Ronan murmured.": "Sara",
  "I just discovered something, Mads.\" Ronan curled his arm over her shoulders and pulled her against him. \"There's only one thing I enjoy more than surprising you.\"\"What's that?\" She snuggled into his embrace and rested her head on his chest....Ronan kissed the top of her head and murmured, \"When you surprise me.": "Sara",
  "He reached up and cupped her face in his hands. \"Did it ever occur to you that I don't want to share you with anyone else? That maybe now that I've realized how much you mean to me, I want to show you as much as I can? Or maybe, because you're so damn sexy and my every freaking fantasy that I can't wait to get you alone, so I can touch you, kiss you, and love you from head to toe?": "Samantha",
  "I just want to be with you. You're my home. My heart. I love you.": "Samantha",
  "Willa came around to Finn's side of the bar. She was tiny, barely came up to his shoulder, but she was like a mother cat when riled. He knew better than to go toe to toe with her, especially when she was giving him The Look. But he wasn't in the mood. \"No,\" he said.\"You don't even know what I'm going to say.\"\"You're going to say I'm being a stupid guy,\" Finn said. \"But newsflash, I am a guy and sometimes we're stupid. Deal with it.\"\"I wasn't going to say that.\" She paused when he slid her a look and she sighed.\"Okay, fine, I was. But you are being stupid.": "Jill",
  "There's something to said about smaller bed - you're forced to stay close to me. Where you belong.": "Samantha",
  "Wow,\" she whispered. \"Gorgeous.\"\"Yeah,\" he said, looking at her.She laughed. \"That's cheesy.\"He grinned. \"You liked it.\"\"No, I didn't.\"He peered at her over his dark sunglasses, letting his gaze slip past her face.She followed his line of sight and realized that her nipples were pressing eagerly against the thin white cotton of her shirt. \"That's because I'm cold,\" she said and crossed her arms over her chest.He laughed. \"It's seventy five degrees.\"\"Downright chilly,\" she said, nose in the air.Grinning, he reeled her in, and with Thor (the dog) protesting between them, he kissed the living daylights out of her.": "Jill",
  "With her hands still fisted in his shirt, she gave a gentle tug until he bent enough that she could kiss him softly. And then not so softly.\u201cWhat was that for?\u201d he asked when she pulled free, his voice sexy low and gruff now.\u201cFor being the kind of guy who can admit he has emotions.\u201dHe cupped her face. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to tell anyone, right?\u201dShe smiled. \u201cIt\u2019ll be our secret.\u201d But then her smile faded because she wasn\u2019t good at secrets.Or maybe she was too good at them . . . \u201cI\u2019m not helpless,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to know that.\u201d\u201cI do know it.\u201d He paused, looking a little irritated again. \u201cMostly.\u201d\u201cGood,\u201d she said. \u201cNow that\u2019s settled, you should know, the caveman thing you just pulled . . . it turned me on a little bit.\u201dHe slid her a look. \u201cYeah?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201dLooking a little less like he was spoiling for a fight, his hands went to her hips and he pulled her in tighter.What the hell was she doing? Clearly, she wasn\u2019t equipped to stay strong, and who could? The guy was just too damn potent. Too visceral. Testosterone and pheromones leaked off of him. She dropped her head to his chest. \u201cUgh. You\u2019re being . . . you.\u201d\u201cWas that in English?\u201d\u201cThis is all your fault.\u201d\u201cNope. Definitely not English.\u201d\u201cYou\u2019re being all hot and sexy, dammit,\u201d she said. She banged her head on his chest a few times. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t seem to . . . not notice said hotness and sexiness.\u201dHe smiled. \u201cYou want me again.\u201dAgain. Still . . . She tossed up her hands. \u201cYou wear your stupid sexiness on your sleeve and you don\u2019t even know it.": "Jill",
  "Clearly, being in love makes you an idiot,\" he muttered...": "Samantha",
  "Feel free to kiss it better.": "Jill",
  "He felt Anna's hand slip into his and he grasped it hard. It was reassuring, soft, comforting. Everything he needed in that moment.": "Samantha",
  "You're the devil, you know that, right?\"\tHis smile grew and became just a bit wicked. \"You know it, sweetheart.": "Samantha",
  "Apparently it'd been too long since her last social orgasm...": "Jill",
  "Quinn shucked his jeans but left his boxers on as he crawled on the bed and covered her body - kissing her along the way. \"I think one of us is still overdressed,\" he murmured.\tShe couldn't help but tease him. \"I was wondering why you left your boxers on.\"\tAnd then he rested his forehead against hers, closed his eyes, and smiled. \"You're not going to make this easy, are you?\"\tShe shook her head. \"I was hoping to make it... hard. Very, very hard.": "Samantha",
  "She'd always been in love with Quinn. Ever since they were kids. She just... she knew. He was the one for her. Her soul mate. The only problem was Quinn didn't feel the same way. She was his pal. His buddy. There'd never once been anything romantic between them, and if he even suspected how she felt, he'd never let on.": "Samantha",
  "I love you, Quinn Shaughnessy. From the very first day when we snuck into my house and stole those chocolate chip cookies and then hid behind the jungle gym, I was hooked.": "Samantha",
  "Wow. You really know how to make a woman happy...\"\"I have a night-eight percent success rate with always knowing what will make a woman happy,\" he said. Lindsey chuckled softly. \"And how do you quantify that?\"\"Would you like to know,\" he said.Nat wanted to know.": "Jamie",
  "Finn was different.And he was different because she wanted him in her left in a way she hadn't wanted anyone for a very long time.Maybe ever.": "Jill",
  "CJ stepped toward her. His hand found her cheek. Natalie's eyes drifted shut. He was going to kiss her. \"Good thing we practiced five years ago,\" he whispered. Natalie whimpered out a pathetic laugh, but then his lips were on hers, his hand tangled in her hair, his other hand holding her against him.And he kissed her.": "Jamie",
  "She hoped he kissed her.Only her.And that when he kissed her, he was thinking about her.Only her.If he kissed her, she would kiss him back.She would kiss him back with everything she had.Every last person in the stadium would watch her kiss him, and every last one of them would know she wouldn't have minded kissing him forever.": "Jamie",
  "You are freaking me out!\" she said with a nervous laugh. \"Who are you, and what have you done with Quinn Shaughnessy?": "Samantha",
  "Get back to work.\"\"Fine way to talk to your wife.\"\"If you were my wife, I would've slapped your ass too.\"She stared at him a beat too long. She did love the feel of his hands on her ass.": "Jamie",
  "My clue is that you're supposed to keep going once you've found me.\"His eyes narrowed. Thoughtfully, as though he were looking for the words she wanted to say instead. \"Keep going in the maze?\" he said slowly. \"Or keep going somewhere else?\"The man had an evil streak. \"The maze,\" she said firmly.Helpfully. Like a dutiful daughter of Bliss.\"Because there are a few places I'd like to go with you.": "Jamie",
  "She gulped her whiskey sour. The bar was hot tonight.CJ circled back to check on them. \"You ladies doing okay?\"\"Define okay.\" Natalie's whiskey seemed to be talking. Because the whiskey was the only thing that could've put that husky, suggestive tone in her voice. Yep, that was all the whiskey.He propped his elbows on the bar, which put his face level with hers, and fixed his undivided attention on her. There went her lady bits fanning themselves. With a few added whimpers. They remembered what his hands and body and lips felt like too.\"Content.\" His voice was low and raw, his gaze penetrating and unwavering. \"Happy. Completely, one hundred percent satisfied.\"Her mouth went dry while the rest of her went up in needy flames that made her want to scratch the all-but-gone rash he'd tended so well on Monday.\"Nope,\" Natalie squeaked. \"Not okay then.": "Jamie",
  "Here\u2019s a little secret. He does care about you, but he cares about you for himself. He\u2019s keeping you safe on a shelf. I bet he interferes with any guy who might show you some attention while he goes out with every pair of perky tits that steps in his path. He may even marry you someday because I\u2019m guessing you and your cardigans are his parents\u2019 wet dream, the perfect ideal of wifey material, but he will own you, D\u2019Arcy. Trust me on this. I know what I\u2019m talking about. Is that what you want? Do you even know what you want?": "A.S.",
  "I don\u2019t know. She didn\u2019t exactly say she didn\u2019t want me. Shit. You\u2019re making me sound like an ass.\u201d \u201cAww. You\u2019re not an ass. You\u2019re just a confused man. That\u2019s why God gave you a sister.": "Claudia",
  "The problem with communication\u2026is the illusion that is has been accomplished.": "George",
  "Indeed, wounded loved can make for fierce vengeance. And, from what I know of Anissa, it does seem a bit out of character for her to behave so spitefully, so I'd like to think that she really is just deeply hurt, angry and looking for some way to injure me back...I hope she knows how well she's succeeded.": "Zack",
  "He held a beautiful bouquet of mixed wildflowers and offered them to her. \"They missed you.\" He brushed a kiss on her lips. \"Just like me.": "Tracy",
  "Hopefully we'll be doing this forever, but we'll only have one first time.": "Tracy",
  "She longed to find out if the sparks would still be there, if her body would still quiver at his touch. \tWhen Rob arrived five o'clock sharp, Jordan had her answer.\tHe climbed out of the truck. Seeing her standing in the doorway, he walked very slowly toward her, like a predator stalking its prey. He was a man on a mission, and Jordan stood frozen to the spot. Rob stopped short in front of her and without any notice, cupped her face, and brought his mouth down on hers.": "Samantha",
  "You busy?\" she asked.\tHe gave her a crooked grin, \"Right now I'd say I'm completely engaged.\"\tShe smiled demurely. \"But I want to take you to my secret place.\"\tBryce loosened his grip on her, giving her a full view of the quizzical, playful look on his face. \"Is that a come-on? Because I'm way past ready to go to your secret place.": "Tracy",
  "Leaning in, he brushed his lips on Holly's cheek, and whispered in her ear, \"You okay?\"\tShe gave him a sidelong glance. \"You might not promise adventure, but you sure do deliver.": "Tracy",
  "I am debating about you, totally stumped between boxers and briefs.\" She winked.\tHe shot her his sexiest look. \"Let me know when you're ready for the big reveal.": "Tracy",
  "When it's the two of us and that pussy of yours is soft, swollen, and wet, I'll be the one in control. I'll have you wherever and whenever I want - in my bed, on my desk, on the floor right now if I want to. I'm going to own that sexy body of yours so thoroughly that you're going to beg for my cock, because it's going to be the only thing in the world that you want. And once I'm buried balls deep in you and you are filled with me, I'm going to make you come apart in the best way possible. Do you understand?": "Avery",
  "Just remember your dick is mine to ride, your body is mine to taste, and your mouth is mine to tease, tempt, and enjoy. I'm not easy, either.\"\"No queen should be.": "Avery",

  "You should seriously get a job planning dates for The Bachelor.": "Nicki",
  "When our fears collided so did our souls.": "Shana",
  "Rob had been her first lover, and she had been his. It was always amazing to her that when all her friends spoke of losing their virginity, they all said how awkward it was, but with Rob it had been beautiful. They had been so in love at seventeen and so confident of their future together that making love had been as natural to them as the simple act of breathing.": "Samantha",
  "He lay between her legs, propped himself on his elbows, and gazed at the sunset in her eyes. \"I want to remember this moment,\" he said huskily.": "Tracy",
  "I can't do this with you again and then watch you go,\" she admitted, her breathing ragged. Her skin tingled all over where their bodies touched and it felt as if it were over a thousand degrees in the house.": "Samantha",
  "Did she want him as badly as he wanted her? Did she realize he was slowly going insane for wanting her?": "Samantha",
  "Rest is highly overrated,\" she said as she rained tiny kisses all over his throat and chest.": "Samantha",
  "Rob?\" she whispered, unsure if he would be easy to wake.\t\"Hmmm?\" he answered sleepily, kissing her on top of her head as he pulled her naked body closer. \"Were you expecting someone else?": "Samantha",
  "Falling in love is not based on the length of time you spend together": "it\u2019s",

  "I'm fine,\" she said. \"I'm just hiding from the Queen General and her latest poster boy.\"\"The Queen General?\" Which one of his sisters fit that description?More like which one didn't.\"Queen General Marilyn,\" his visitor said. \"Supreme ruler of Bliss and chairperson of Knot Festival.\"The words 'Knot Festival' twisted CJ's stomach, and the room seemed to climb ten degrees hotter. He tugged at his bow tie. The woman kept talking...Marilyn rewrote the Golden Husband Games rules so her Exalted Widower is eligible to be named Husband of the Half Century. And you know what? He's the reason my husband left me.": "Jamie",
  "They don't like my kind in here,\" Arthur said to CJ...I own a shop on The Aisle.

  "You stay married thirty-four years, you don't have to prove who's got the bigger balls. Just take it for granted she does.": "Jamie",
  "One day, son, you're gonna find yourself your everything. When you do, you tell her. And then you make sure you live it. Live it every day.": "Jamie",
  "There's something you need to know,\" he said.Her own breath came out loud and uneven. He was entirely in her personal space, but she'd given him enough power as it was. She wouldn't back away, wouldn't let him see her agitation. He tucked her hair behind her ear. Tension took hold of her body. She shuddered, looked up to tell him to stop, but he bent forward, his lips parted, a single freckle on his cheek drawing her attention while his lips got closer and closer and closer until ---\"For future reference,\" he said, \"I never kiss horribly.\" And before she could blink or breathe or think, his lips closed over hers. His grip tightened in her hair, and when she should've protested or pulled away or kicked him in the shins, her body melted into his. Kissing him was wrong.... So wrong. She was so good at so wrong.": "Jamie",
  "She was fixated on replaying the image of a tall, broad, Highland warrior marching into battle against the evil waterfalls of doom to rescue a stuffed dinosaur.He'd saved Cindy.For Noah.CJ Blue was making it very difficult for Natalie to continue to dislike him.": "Jamie",
  "Sometimes fate is what you make it, and I'm making my life with you.": "Leisa",
  "But this kiss? It's ruined me. This is the type of kiss I never knew existed. It's like falling and flying, all in the same moment.": "Leisa",

  "She was magic, a direct light\u2014the kind that seeps through in places that didn\u2019t exist inside him anymore. The light he thought he lost forever, but Nick realized we don\u2019t lose the light, we absorb it, and with Olivia he wanted to absorb every small speck of it.": "Maria",
  "He stood there watching for a moment, not able to move. Even with her mascara running down her face and her hair beginning to frizz, she was still by far the most beautiful girl he\u2019d ever laid eyes on. It was quite simple, wasn\u2019t it? This great affection he had for Olivia was so overwhelming he chose to walk away instead of being brutally honest with himself.": "Maria",
  "Leo was a force of nature. He lived life big and loud in all respects\u2026which meant that when he got riled up, everyone was sucked into the vortex along with him. His temper was legendary, but then again, so were his passions. He was charming and charismatic, brilliant and quick. He loved to argue, loved to box and work out, loved to laugh, loved to\u2026love. And from the day they\u2019d met, he\u2019d swept her up into his whirlwind sphere, and she felt like she hadn\u2019t been allowed a second to breathe since. Not that she\u2019d minded, not while it had all still been safe and contained. She\u2019d delighted in his passions\u2026all of them. But everything was different now.": "J.K.",
  "That voice inside his head telling him he\u2019d failed Bria when she needed him most was getting louder every day, but he refused to listen. That wouldn\u2019t help. He never looked back.

  "Just how good are you?\u201dHe kissed her. \u201cI\u2019ll let you be the judge of that.": "Kate",

  "Pethi mou, you are one special lady. Take care of yourself. If you ever need anything, you know where I am.\" Then he surprised her by placing a kiss on her cheek. She savored the feel of his lips as they feathered against her skin, the gentle caressing of his hands in her hair, and she couldn't help nuzzling against him.He inhaled sharply.He cupped her head, his fingers strong, yet gentle.

  "The special please,\" she said, waving a coupon from the week's paper. \"The young rejuvenating facial.

  "A toast,\" she declared. \"To an incredible summer kicking butt and chasing dreams.": "Rachel",
  "She simply wanted one night to live out her fantasy. For as long as she could remember, Charlie Tucker had been the guy, and tonight, all she wanted was for him to see her as more than just a little kid. To actually see her as someone desirable.\tTo simple see... her.": "Rachel",

  "He regretted nothing. Not the way she\u2019d felt in his arms and not the way he\u2019d felt in hers.": "Jill",
  "Yes. This. It was just what she needed, because here, held by him like this, her guilt, her regret, her fears . . . all of it gave way to this heady, languid sensation of being desired and she didn\u2019t want it to stop.Any of it.": "Jill",

  "Maybe we should go to JT's or bowling or something.\"The lopsided grin on Reece's face was probably just as sexy as his kiss, Alesha thought.Reaching for her hand, he gave it a gentle squeeze. \"If that's what you really want to do, we'll do it, but I think we can control ourselves for the rest of the night.\" Then he winked. \"If that's what you really want.": "Samantha",
  "They laughed.They kissed.They loved.": "Samantha",
  "We'll have all night for slow and sweet,\" she said softly. \"But right now, I really want that hard and fast you mentioned earlier.": "Samantha",
  "He swallowed hard. \"How do you feel?\"\"I feel like I want to close these drapes, turn down the lights and crawl into that bed with you and spend the night making love with you. All night.\" She blushed furiously. ...\"All night, huh?\" he asked.She nodded.He gave her a sexy grin and repeated her earlier words back to her. \"Deal.": "Samantha",
  "I've been thinking about this all day,\" he said between kisses. \"All. Day.\"Who was she kidding? She'd been harboring this fantasy for weeks. And then in a move that was becoming her 'thing', Alesha leaned back and pulled her sweater over her head and gave Reece a sexy smile. \"Was this part of what you were thinking?\"His hands came up and cupped her breasts, his breath ragged, but his eyes were on hers. \"This is better.": "Samantha",
  "Stop talking,\" she said boldly as she closed the distance between them until they were touching. \"We can walk to the bedroom or you can carry me but if you don't decide soon I may just go insane.": "Samantha",
  "Do you have any idea how badly I want to pick you up and carry you into my bedroom and make love to you?": "Samantha",
  "Alesha walked up to him and looped her arms around his shoulders as she went up on her tiptoes and kissed him. She only meant for it to be a quick kiss but Reece's arms instantly banded around her as he took it deeper. She was readily on board. The man certainly knew how to kiss and she wasn't going to ask him to stop!...She squirmed for a moment and then reluctantly lifted her head. \"Wow.\"He chuckled. \"I kind of like that I keep getting that response from you.\"\"I'm normally much more prolific with words but whenever you kiss me, I can't seem to remember any.\"His smile deepened. \"Now I definitely like that.": "Samantha",
  "He kissed her.He touched her.He fantasized about how incredible it would be to strip her down and make love to her.But tonight wasn't the night for that.With his mind made up, Reece simply enjoyed the moment -- the feel of her, the sounds she made and knew he probably wasn't going to get any more sleep once he left her and said goodnight.": "Samantha",
  "Reece?\" she asked softly.\"Hmmm?\"\"Kiss me.\"And he did. There wasn't even a possibility of saying no.": "Samantha",
  "I don't want you to go back to Miami already.\"\t\"You don't? You could have your house all to yourself.\" Her voice was whisper soft.\t\"I don't want my house all to myself. I like you in it.

  "She slid on the helmet. \"Thanks, Prince Charming.\"\t\"Huh?\"\t\"You know, Cinderella,\" she said. \"The prince had her slipper and you had my helmet...": "Jill",
  "You are the reason my heart beats. Your love is my lifeline, and I'm not about to give it up - not now - not ever!": "Emily",
  "I'm ready,\" she promised. She kissed his jaw and then rubbed her cheek against it, letting out a low hum of arousal at the feel of his stubble on her skin. He had a scent that every single one of her senses responded to. The texture of his skin, the taste of his tongue, the latent strength in his hands - everything about him did it for her. \"I want this,\" she said. \"I want you.": "Jill",
  "This had already been the best sex she'd ever had and all he'd done was touch her.": "Jill",
  "I know I'm the one who put limits on this... this thing,\" she said, and bit her lower lip, suddenly nervous. \"But I'm pretty sure we're not quite done with each other.\"\tHe looked at her for what felt like a long time. \"You want another night.\"\tStill unable to take her eyes off his mouth, she didn't muzzle herself. \"I want as long as it takes.\"\tHe cupped her jaw, lifting her head up so that she was looking into his eyes again. \"Don't make promises you can't keep.\"\t\"What makes you think I can't keep it?\"\t\"Because you seem to like things one night at a time,\" he said in that low, sexy voice. \"But no way is one more night going to be enough.": "Jill",
  "Cupping a cheek in each hand, he lifted her back up to his desk and pressed his hips hard into hers.\tHer eyes were worried. \"But people keep coming---\"\t\"The next person to come is going to be you,\" he said.": "Jill",

  "A few moments ago, he'd had her up against a wall, skirt shoved up to her belly button, hands in her panties, his fingers driving her straight to oblivion, and now... now he was this intense, cool, calm, and collected man.\tWith a gun.\t\"Breanne. Are you ok?\"\tShe stared at him. He had his shirt loose and draped over the bulge of his gun. He looked rough-and-tumble. Baddass.\tDamn it, she had a serious weakness for badass.": "Jill",
  "He was just drifting off when he heard her soft whisper. \"Cooper?\"\t\"Still here.\" Maybe she'd changed her mind about the sheet. The thought made his body twitch. Yeah, she was going to toss that damn thing aside and roll toward him. She'd wrap that hot little bod tight to his, and he'd ---\t\"Thank you.\" Breanne said very quietly.\tHe blinked. \"Thank you? He slid his hand down to cup himself. Still hard. Nope, he hadn't missed anything...": "Jill",
  "All he wanted was a long, hot shower and a long, deep sleep.\tMeaning that whoever this pissed-off brunette was, whatever deal she'd arranged with his flaky mother, they could talk about it after he'd scrubbed the jungle from his skin and rinsed the shampoo from his hair.\t\"What do you mean it belongs to you? It can't belong to you. I just rented it,\" said the girl aiming that pink blow-dryer right at his heart.\tIf he wasn't so damn exhausted, he might find that funny.

  "It's nice to see you. Aimee calls you Bigfoot, by the way.\"\t\"Bigfoot?\"\t\"Yeah, you know, like a mythical creature that people say they've seen in the wild but no one knows for sure if it's real. That's you...": "Tracy",
  "Could be a cold night so I guess I'll start a fire.\"\t\"A fire? Have you got wood?\"\tA curve played at the corner of his mouth. \"Oh, yeah. I got wood.\"\tThe door slammed before she realized what she'd said.": "Tracy",
  "Is there a reason why you\u2019re standing there, staring out the window and watching the neighbors? Are we preparing to kill them and drag them down to the basement and bury them alive?": "R.L.",

  "She looks like a Disney princess, but is a total badass.": "Mary",
  "I prefer doing over watching.": "Mary",
  "There was no substitute for a post-coital cuddle.": "Mary",
  "Teeth clenched, she swiped the light switch next to the door, but all she got was a 'click.'\t'Click, click.'\t\"Ugh,\" Lindsey moaned. She'd need to flip a breaker, and for that she'd need a flashlight. But that would only fix things if the power was actually on.\t\"I'm working on that.\" The deep voice with a drawl came from the dark hallway, and the man that matched it stepped out of the shadows.": "Tracy",
  "Welcome to Thistle Bend ": "Wildflower",
  "Let's start with ice cream and go from there.\"\t\"You're gonna love it.\" Holly nodded. \"All their ingredients are fresh, and they make the most delicious, wackiest flavors you've ever heard of.\"\tClearly she'd forgotten that Lindsey had come from D.C. \"Like what?\"\t\"Honey lavender. Sweet corn raspberry. Toasted coconut fudge. Lemon fig....blueberry pie... marshmallow peach... salted caramel chocolate chunk...": "Tracy",
  "Maybe he dates girls in Denver when he goes there for business but he never asks out girls around here. I think he's simply there for looks.\"\tThe same could be said for Lindsey's ex, Hopper. He had been good for looking at but not much else. \"That might work for a little while,\" Lindsey said, \"but I prefer my men fully functional.\"\tHolly's gaze locked on something behind Lindsey. Her hazel eyes widened and her lips formed an 'O'. She tipped her head forward, prompting Lindsey to turn and look ... straight into the eyes of Carden Crenshaw.": "Tracy",
  "He opted for a flaky, apricot-filled croissant and Columbian coffee. Dani chided him for being unimaginative, then proceeded to eat most of his, while ignoring her own.\t\"I'd be glad to buy you one.\"\tDani gave him a wide-eyed, innocent stare, then popped the last bit of his breakfast into her mouth.\t\"I couldn't eat another bite.": "Mary",
  "Depends on whether you talk to the Montgomery sisters,\" he said to Lindsey.\tHolly chuckled lightly. \"Now, that's a whole other old TV show mash-up right there. Hmm...I'd say 'Charmed' meets 'The Golden Girls'.\"\t\"With a little 'Bewitched' thrown in for fun.\" Carden pressed his index finger to the tip of his nose and twitched it back and forth, somehow making himself seem more irresistible.": "Tracy",
  "What's your name, big guy?\" Carden asked.\tBlue let out something between a bark and a howl that sounded just like,\" Bluuuue.\"\t\"Good boy,\" Carden said, and gave Blue the dog biscuit. Blue took it in his mouth and crunched it into pieces, eating it bit by bit instead of gobbling.\tThat's all it took for Lindsey to fall head-over-heels for Blue. His owner wasn't too bad either.": "Tracy",
  "He smoothed his fingers along her jawline and lifted her chin, kissing her gently, testing.\tLindsey went light-headed with the rush of sensation, the touch of his lips leaving her longing for more. Clutching his shirt in her fingers - napkin and all - she pulled him closer, melting into his kiss. Carden took it from tentative to tender, then parted her lips with the velvety sweep of his tongue. She matched his languid rhythm, hypnotized. He was all chocolate and caramel, creamy cool and sweet.\t'Sinfully delicious'.\tNo doubt he was 31 flavors of trouble, but resisting him seemed impossible.": "Tracy",
  "We've been given a second chance. How many people can say that?": "Mary",
  "She smoothed her fingertips down his cheeks and cupped his face in her hands. \"I'm not sure it can get any better.\"\tHe sucked in a ragged breath. \"Oh, darlin',\" he said, sliding his finger beneath one of the straps of her sundress and guiding it off of her shoulder. \"I promise you it can.\" He kissed the spot where the strap had been and drew his fingers up her thighs with a light, feathery touch. \"And I'm a man who keeps his promises.": "Tracy",
  "Two old women described as \"Charmed meets The Golden Girls with a little Bewitched thrown in for fun\" were bound to have something curious to contribute.": "Tracy",
  "He cleared his throat. \"I did get carried away with you. Couldn't help myself. And when I said it wouldn't happen again...\" He risked skimming his fingers up her smooth shin. \"I hope I lied.": "Tracy",
  "Twining his fingers through her ponytail, he cradled the back of her head, seducing her nearly senseless with a single kiss - on a mountainside covered in wildflowers, under the summer sun and an endless sky.": "Tracy",
  "I came all prepared for a lapis show-and-tell, but you know more about it than I do.\"...\tLindsey gave him a pleading look and brushed her fingertips over the back of his hand, sending tingles up his arm. \"Show me.\"...\t\"When it's cut and polished like this, it practically glows. Golden specks of pyrite dance across the blue, like stars in a denim sky.": "Tracy",
  "I'm scared as hell to fall for you.\" He loosened his embrace, cupped her face in his hands, and kissed her tenderly. \"But I'm more terrified to let you go.": "Tracy",
  "Lindsey looked at him coyly \"Grilling is your specialty?\" She shook her head. \"You really had me fooled.\"\tHe set the platter on the island, joined her near the sprawling sectional sofa in the living area, and took her in his arms. She'd never get tired of that feeling.\t\"Had you fooled how?\" he asked.\t\"I thought kissing was your specialty.\"\tCarden captivated her with his sultry gave. \"Grilling... Kissing...\" He brushed his lips over hers, teasingly light and feathery. \"Take your pick, darlin;,\" he said in a low whisper, pulling her closer....\t\"Stay tuned,\" he said with a rasp in his voice. \"I've got a couple other specialties, too.": "Tracy",
  "How can it hurt so much to love someone?": "Tracy",
  "I could use a shower myself.\" He pulled her close and kissed her, tucking his hand beneath the sheet and smoothing it down the satiny curve of her hip. \"We'd get to breakfast a lot quicker if we took one together.": "Tracy",
  "Water droplets streamed down her face and clung to her eyelashes. She blinked up at him with mischief in her eyes, and the urge to kiss her overwhelmed him. Not like he had in the closet, with care and discretion, but with hunger and passion and pent up desire. He wanted to take her bottom lip between his teeth and deal with the consequences later.": "Robin",
  "Something has gotten into me; something I didn\u2019t want. The moment my skin touched hers, it overwhelmed me with desires of the deepest kind. It\u2019s crawled beneath my flesh, and my every pore is infected by her. An addiction that is as frustrating as this illness.": "LeeAnn",
  "Alex had a nice big cock and knew how to use it.": "Mary",
  "Why is the TV on, and why aren't you on the way to naked?\"...\t\"My head and the rest of me\" - he drew her attention to his erection - \"heard sex. No putting that genie back in the lamp...": "Mary",
  "She stepped over to the model. \"The little town looks so sweet in the moonlight.\"\tAnd so did Lindsey. Her sexy silhouette had him riveted in place. He knew better, but his instincts urged him to go to her. Joining her next to the model, he skimmed his fingertips over her bare shoulder and down her arm. He reached her hand and languidly laced his fingers between hers. \"Not nearly as sweet as you look,\" he whispered close to her ear...": "Tracy",
  "I'll keep my lips to myself, if that's what you want.": "Cassie",
  "There would be no salvaging this. I was going to die a spinster with cobwebs feasting on my vagina, I just knew it.": "R.",
  "I just realized, baby, right now, thinking of how I could take this pain away from you, I just realized that you have to feel it. You gotta make your way through all the bad stuff to get to the good.": "Molly",
  "She was saying words she didn\u2019t totally believe yet. And maybe I was, too. But I wanted them to be true. For the first and only time in my life, I wanted to belong to someone and have that person belong to me.": "Molly",
  "That was one of the things she loved about him. He assumed she could walk and chew gum at the same time. He never second-guessed her, and he didn't try to change her. He accepted.": "Jill",
  "No one who's been into music ever really stops being into it. It's in your soul forever. Maybe it gets buried deep under piles of shit for a while, but it's always there, waiting to make you happy again.": "Ophelia",
  "Either I'm yours, and you're mine, or we're nothing.\"\"What?\" She blinks her confusion.\"I said,\" drawing out the word and giving her a few seconds to ge accustomed to our new reality. \"Either I'm yours and you're mine, or we're nothing. I don't want to be your friend. I want to be... yours.": "Kennedy",
  "Hmm,\" she hums after a moment.\"What?\"\"Just thinking...We both want you to get this role.\"\"No sh*t.\"\"And arguing obviously isn't helping us out.\"I snort. \"But that's what we do.": "Cassie",
  "She lifted her chin; her head weighed fifty pounds. \"You tried to poison me.\"\tPretty sure I succeeded in that.": "Ophelia",
  "Luke's eyes were on a government position in DC, while all Natalie wanted was help make the world a sweeter place.": "Ophelia",
  "I can taste sunshine and hope on his tongue. I want this kiss, this taste, to last forever.": "Elisabeth",
  "Screw it. Girl's gotta do what a girl's gotta do.": "Kennedy",
  "You have no idea what I'm thinking,\" he said. \"No idea what I'm feeling --- about you.\" He walked to her, reached out and touched her cheek. \"But we both need to find out.": "Ophelia",
  "I want something real. Something that leads to something more than sex.": "Victoria",
  "You have a devious mind. And that is so incredibly sexy.": "Jennifer",
  "I love hugging you,\" Luke said. \"I love how our bodies fit when we're still...I feel like a broken record when I say I know there are a hundred reasons why we shouldn't but Nat, I really want to kiss you.": "Ophelia",
  "Your head can't do a relationship and my heart can't.": "Ophelia",
  "Though there're minor side effects in male adults.\"\t\"What side effect?\"\tShe cocked an eyebrow and lowered her voice. \"Spontaneous prolonged erection, big guy...in some test subjects,\" she added clinically. \"A lot of those early tests were done on gorillas...\t\"I'm not a gorilla.\"\tShe glanced down the front of his lab coat. \"Not yet.": "Ophelia",
  "We're not thirteen and this isn't a locker room.\"\t\"Fine, fine. Just remember, I had to watch Dr. Phil with Mom for two months after I had knee surgery. I'm practically a psychiatrist.": "Ophelia",
  "Hey,\" Natalie said. \"You're here early.\"\t\"It's almost seven. Why are you covered in chocolate? Your clothes and your...your face. Both your faces.\"\tLuke looked at Natalie, really looked at her. Yep, she was smeared with chocolate like it was camo paint, transferred from his mouth to hers and back again too many times to count.\t\"We were...\" Natalie began. \"We were just ---\"\t\"Sampling,\" Luke cut in. If Natalie had wanted Ivy to know, she would've come straight out with it.\tIvy crossed her arms. \"Sampling?\"\t\"Yeah, I'm interested in her...product. So she let me, uh, try some.\" Wow, he couldn't have sounded kinkier if he'd tried.\t\"But it's all over the floor on that side of the lab. Like, all over the place. It's even on the wall. How did it get on the ceiling? You must be one sloppy eater.": "Ophelia",
  "You\u2019re not broken, Dylan. I know you\u2019re not.": "Molly",
  "The way he looked at her made her heart beat fast. \"I like you, Natalie.\"\tShe could not let that mean anything to her. \t\"That's natural. I'm likable.": "Ophelia",
  "It\u2019s about his family. It will always be about his family. And himself. Deep in your heart you know that and you\u2019re trying to convince yourself that you can save him. And you can\u2019t. There\u2019s no saving Dylan Daniels.": "Molly",
  "Sometimes, maybe we don\u2019t know exactly what we have until someone shows us.": "Molly",
  "I'd rather have sex than dessert.": "Mary",
  "She wasn't going to explain how the morning she woke up alone she had gone back to the same salon that had cut and dyed her hair and had the woman change the color back. She wasn't going to tell him that she hadn't been able to stand the thought of looking into the mirror to see that girl anymore. The girl who had been born the day she met Alex and died the day he left.": "Mary",
  "I guess you can't estimate the speed of a teenage boy when he thinks he has a shot at sex. He never had a shot. But if he was that fast removing his pants, can you imagine how quick the sex would have been?": "Mary",
  "How devastating to find 'the one' and not be 'their one.": "Mary",
  "Something tells me that Alex has some demons and I can tell you from experience that those suckers don't go down easy.": "Mary",
  "He'd gotten in a quick swipe with his tongue the moment he'd been close enough to reach. Then, just to be sure, he went in for another sample, bathing Alex's leg with saliva, careful to miss the dangly bits between the man's legs. Edgar didn't get what the big deal was. He licked himself there all the time. However, Jack made a big deal out of it so he avoided that area like he'd been taught.": "Mary",
  "His height forced her to stand on her toes. For a woman who\u2019d been taller than most of the boys in her class in high school, that particular physical trait provoked a flurry of sensual images to flash through her mind. Sex against a wall. It was a possibility. And given the breadth of his shoulders, she imagined he\u2019d hold her up just fine. Oh, glorious day.": "Mia",
  "She couldn\u2019t stop kissing him. Literally could not. There could be an earthquake, a fire, an explosion\u2014who would notice? The whole world could come crashing down and it wouldn\u2019t be enough for her to pull away.": "Rebecca",
  "Freedom you earn is more powerful than freedom handed to you.": "Marissa",
  "I've got this.": "Jill",
  "The kiss was so soft she couldn\u2019t believe this was the same bad boy who\u2019d said such things to her with that mouth.": "Rebecca",
  "Or what is it you used to say when we\u2019d to go out in my pickup truck down by the pond, just the two of us? I\u2019m the bit to your bridle. I\u2019m the Jack in your Daniels\u2026.\u201dWould it be weird if I were shedding tears right now?\u201cYou\u2019re the fruit in my pie\u2026you\u2019re the sprinkles on my cake,\u201d I finish his sentence.": "A.Wilding",
  "Her fingers traced his stomach, trying to remember this is real, this is real with each strike of her heart.": "Rebecca",
  "What if everything about me is totally made up? What if I\u2019m actually\u2026I don\u2019t know. A wanted fugitive in the States.\u201d\u201cJulia.\u201d He reached across the table and grabbed her hand. \u201cNobody makes up being a high school math teacher.\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s the perfect disguise!\u201dHe shook his head. \u201cNobody.": "Rebecca",
  "Did you get a secret thrill out of sitting across from me, eating a civilized dinner while pretending not to know you were teasing my cock?\" Rate St. Sebastian": "Samanthe",
  "Sometimes that\u2019s what it takes. Putting it all out there and hoping love wins.": "Marissa",
  "The money is too good to say no.": "Ali",
  "You didn\u2019t care about anything except my tongue tracing the path of your thong. All the way down\u2026\" Rafe St. Sebastian": "Samanthe",
  "If Blake thought she was going to be some meek, mealy-mouthedpushover grateful for his dick and his non-apologies, he obviously didn\u2019t know what it took to make a room full of tenth graders pay attention.": "Rebecca",
  "I like to play dirty. I can also be very, very exacting.\u201d Rate St. Sebastian.": "Samanthe",
  "I warned you the next time you spread your legs for me, I wouldn't be a gentleman. Did you expect a gentleman, Chelsea?\" Rate St. Sebastian": "Samanthe",
  "Bad is the new good - you've got my permission to stick that on one of your t-shirts.": "Lia",
  "Use your dick, don\u2019t be one.": "Marissa",
  "Never, even in his wildest dreams, had his imagination come close to the reality of her.": "Marissa",
  "Only you can tell your story.": "Andria",
  "The downside, my beauty, is that you\u2019re in a fogged glass bubble that\u2019s as far out of my reach as I can imagine. I wish you would use your gaudy engagement ring to cut a hole through the glass to be able see me.": "A.Wilding",
  "When she at last pressed her mouth to his, it felt like coming home. He tasted of fire and smoke and earth, and fresh bread and soap and something so clean, so pure, it was like spring water to her lips.": "Rebecca",
  "I go from flying to drowning as I slide down the soul-deadening slippery slope I realize I\u2019m on. I can\u2019t breathe, can\u2019t talk, suddenly realizing I\u2019m an imposter. I\u2019ve crossed the line. Wronged my girl. And in that few seconds of thought I feel fate strong-arm me, forcing me to turn and walk away like a helpless idiot needing to be put out of his misery.": "A.Wilding",
  "Moving on was going to require leaving the woods and getting a friend set that didn\u2019t have gray hairs, hip replacements and a few false teeth.": "Rebecca",
  "I played the part well, but I was as fake as a California tan on an Alaskan cheerleader.": "Sierra",
  "Close only counts in horse shoes and hand grenades.": "Nicole",
  "Luke snapped awake to see the gray-haired woman looking at him while adjusting her glasses. She smiled like he was something to eat. \"There aren't many good shots of you when Natalie was on your lap. She's either leaning over you, or you're at her neck like Bela Lugosi. Though there's one really good part at the end ---": "Ophelia",
  "He pointed past her shoulder. \"We're surrounded by neighbors. Though once I have you inside, the walls are thick. You'll have to scream really loud for anyone to hear.": "Ophelia",
  "She kissed her teenage fantasy, the popular boy she used to dream would see something special in her and love her forever. The man kissed her back.": "Ophelia",
  "Hmmm, you like that,\" he whispered, his breath hot and intoxicating.\t\"I like ... everything.": "Ophelia",
  "You're head can't do a relationship and my heart can't.": "Ophelia",
  "I want to make people smile. I want to tell an epic story... with laughter. I want to change the way people view the world. I want life to stop being so damn dramatic all the time. I want... what are you doing?": "Cassie",
  "There's no point in making a plan because somehow it always manages to fall apart.": "Jami",
  "Listen, do you think we could, you know, have sex ? I could pay you extra of course. I know it\u2019s not part of your job , but I\u2019d love to strip you bare to just those pearls and bury myself in your\u2014": "Angela",
  "What's he doing here anyway? And where is his shirt? I take a quick glance and swallow hard. Never Mind. The shirt can stay gone.": "Jami",
  "She's been a barrel of bitchy monkeys since Jordan and I walked out of the Arrivals gate together earlier this afternoon.": "Victoria",
  "Words are meaningless when there are no actions backing them up. Prove to me that you feel that way. Don't just tell me, show me.": "Monica",
  "When I take you in my arms, I wonder how on earth I ever survived without know what that felt like before I met you.": "Jennifer",
  "He\u2019s a man of few words except when it really counts. And when he does, every word has meaning.": "Ashlee",
  "Why do I feel the need to be polite? It was not good seeing him. It was torturous. I hope I can avoid him the rest of the night.\"\t\"Maybe he'll trip and fall into the pool.\"\t\"Ryan can't swim.\"\t\"Then I'll push him into the pool.": "Jennifer",
  "Love gets straight to the heart of what\u2019s worthwhile in life.": "M.K.",
  "Romance novels could teach a man a thing or two, if he was smart enough to open his mind and really see.": "M.K.",
  "No matter how many women I\u2019ve kissed over the years, your lips are the ones that still haunt me.": "Cathryn",
  "I've done a lot of stupid things because of my fear of taking a chance on someone. But the most stupid thing I ever did was push you away.": "Jennifer",
  "He\u2019d found himself intrigued by the way she\u2019d weaved the lives of two very different people together, how she played off their strengths and weakness, how against all odds she brought them together and made it seem believable. Even if it was nothing more than make-believe. She was a talented writer.": "M.K.",
  "If you\u2019ll trust me, I\u2019ll give you a week you\u2019ll never forget.": "Cathryn",
  "You\u2019re smart. Don\u2019t sell yourself short by thinking all you are is pretty to look at. What about this new person you plan to become? Is she going to starve herself and work out to the point of exhaustion so she can have a beautiful body too? Because if she is, then she\u2019s going to have the same problems with unwanted attention as the person you are now does.": "Wendy",
  "You have so many relationship-worthy qualities. Either the guys around here are complete idiots or you\u2019ve never shown them the real you.": "Wendy",
  "I think it wasn\u2019t the Cirque du Soleil audition that was my once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, it\u2019s Rory.": "Wendy",
  "She hesitated a moment then slipped her arm through his. \"Just remember, I lead, you follow.\"\t\"Okay, but when we're dancing at the wedding, I lead, you follow.\"\tShe sighed dramatically. \"I guess I can agree to that.\"\tHe chuckled. \"See? I have a feeling this the beginning of a beautiful fake relationship.\"\tShe worried her bottom lip as they walked toward the kitchen together. \"I'm sure glad one of us feels that way.": "Jennifer",
  "His mom was more the rich pampered type whose version of natural childbirth meant giving birth without makeup.": "Jennifer",
  "She'd hardly describe Trent as \"cute.\" Adonis, stud-like, hottie McHot Hot, even pulchritudinous - all acceptable descriptions. Hardly just cute.": "Jennifer",
  "Desperate.": "He",
  "He's totally caught me, and I'm never letting him toss me back.": "Cassie",
  "Laird suffered second degree burns ...in the frank and beans area, if you know what I mean.\"\tTrent winced. That must have been one hell of a breakup.": "Jennifer",
  "Amanda, whether you know it or not, I'm all the security you'll ever need. I would never let anyone harm a single hair on your head.": "Stephanie",
  "Maddie had seen commercials for Match Made Easy on TV. They seemed like a decent business and legit. She hoped. She prayed they weren't out of her price range. Not that it mattered - time was running out. She'd pay anything to prove to her family she wasn't cursed. Plus, Ryan would be there, most likely with that cheating blonde of his. She bet anything they'd both love to see her at her lowest point: jobless and dateless. Well, no one was going to feel sorry for her. Not her cousin and certainly not the best man, either. She'd show them all. And since she couldn't find a wedding date to her sister's wedding on her own, it looked as if she'd be forced to do the next best thing. Hire one.": "Jennifer",
  "Sorry! I didn't mean to say that,\" I mumble into the pillow next to her head.\"Oh.\"\"No! I mean, I meant what I said. I just didn't mean to tell you.": "Victoria",
  "Beauty is more than perfect features, Birdy. There's something about you that draws everyone to you, the way flowers turn toward the sun. You walk into a room and the place comes alive. You are beautiful, Birdy. All the more so because you don't even realize it.": "Suzanne",
  "He leaned in and kissed her. The world didn\u2019t stop dead on its axis. Nothing fell from the sky. It was a gentle meeting of flesh, not a melding of souls. Yet the taste of her lips was everything he remembered, and more. Without moving a muscle\u2014without batting an eyelash\u2014she managed to take ten years of simmering frustration and dissolve them as if they were nothing more than a spoonful of sugar in a pot of hot water.He straightened. A series of expressions tripped across her face in rapid succession. He caught shellshock, bemusement, and then a faint trace of\u2026sadness.Definitely not one-sided. But not what he\u2019d been looking for, either.": "Paula",
  "The open zipper at the bottom revealed two important details: her ass was as luscious as he had imagined, and she wasn't wearing any panties. His palms started to sweat. How was he supposed to fasten her dress when all he wanted to do was tear it off?": "Stacey",
  "She stared at him. Her head tipped to the side and she narrowed her eyes. \u201cThat\u2019s the best you can come up with? What kind of platitude is that?\u201d \u201cGive me a second. I can do better.\u201d He lifted her hand, then reached for her other one. He pulled her close so they stood toe to toe. She shivered a little. He didn\u2019t think it had much to do with the cold. Her arms were bare, but the evening was warm. \u201cEverything happens for a reason. God works in mysterious ways. There\u2019s a light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d\u201cYou suck at this.\u201d But she was smiling. She was so achingly beautiful. He slid his hands up her arms to her elbows so they were closer still. And then she leaned against him, resting her head on his shoulder, and he forgot how to breathe. He stood in the shadows, holding her in his arms, wanting to do the right thing and afraid he\u2019d screw it all up. Her hands nestled the small of his back, thumbs hooked through his belt. Her lips brushed against the sensitive base of his throat. Awareness burned through every single spot her body came in contact with his. This was Danni, all grown up. He wanted one little taste. Just a bit.So he kissed her. And, without a second\u2019s hesitation, she kissed him back. The world around them rocked back on its heels.Then some small noise interrupted\u2014the sound of footsteps, passing too close. He lifted his head, not wanting any intrusion, and the moment ended as fast as it had begun.": "Paula",
  "If I stay, it\u2019s going to be in your bed.\u201d \tHer pounding heart relaxed, the fear that he\u2019d reject her floating away like tiny grains of sand in the wind. \u201cI know.\u201d\t\u201cAnd we\u2019re not going to sleep.\u201d\t\u201cI\u2019m good with that, too.": "Robin",
  "Speaking of body decorations, I luuhhhvv your belly piercing!\u201d Heeb said, looking at the gold ring in the center of her slim, tan waist. Despite the artic cold, Angelina had opted for a skin tight, black tube top that ended just above her belly, on the assumption that a warm cab, a winter coat, and a short wait to get into the club was an adequate frosty weather strategy. Heeb was still reverently staring at her belly when Angelina finally caught her breath from laughing.\u201cDo you really like it? You\u2019re just saying that so that you can check out my belly!\u201d\u201cAnd what\u2019s so bad about that? I mean, didn\u2019t you get that belly piercing so that people would check out your belly?\u201d\u201cNo. I just thought it would look cool\u2026Do you have any piercings?\u201d\u201cActually, I do,\u201d Heeb replied.\u201cWhere?\u201d\u201cMy appendix.\u201d\u201cHuh?\u201d\u201cI wanted to be the first guy with a pierced organ. And the appendix is a totally useless organ anyway, so I figured why the hell not?\u201d\u201cThat\u2019s pretty original,\u201d she replied, amused.\u201cOh yeah. I\u2019ve outdone every piercing fanatic out there. The only problem is when I have to go through metal detectors at the airport.\u201dAngelina burst into laughs again, and then managed to say, \u201cDon\u2019t you have to take it out occasionally for a cleaning?\u201d\u201cNah. I figure I\u2019ll just get it removed when my appendix bursts. It\u2019ll be a two for one operation, if you know what I mean.": "Zack",
  "Want to know a secret?\"\"Yeah!\" His smile grew big and broad.\"I don't know how to saddle a horse either. And I've never even ridden on one before.\" His eyes grew wide as the moon. \"Jase!\" he bellowed, spinning toward his brother.\"She's never ridden a horse before!\" Well, there went my secret.": "J.",
  "I trust you.\"\"Good.\" There was a flash of a quick smile and then he was out of the Jeep.  I tracked him with my eyes, feeling a little dizzy. It was the truth. I did trust him and that was a big deal for me. I really hadn't trusted any guy since Jeremy, anyone except my brother. But I had trusted Jase from the moment I had met him.": "J.",
  "There\u2019s no more perfect way to fall asleep than having my arms wrapped around her while I breathe in her peaches and cream scent that is mixed with the scent of us and sweat.": "Rein",
  "Spread, Foxy. Show me that sweet spot.": "Sherilee",
  "You ready for this? You ready for what I\u2019m gonna do to you?": "Sherilee",
  "Christ, you have a body made for sin.": "Sherilee",
  "You been taking care of yourself a long time, Foxy. You must be fucking hungry for it. I bet you\u2019re drenched right now.": "Sherilee",
  "There\u2019s no more perfect way to fall asleep then having my arms wrapped around her while I breathe in her peaches and cream scent that is mixed with the scent of us and sweat.": "Rein",
  "Foxy, you made me blow a load in my jeans.": "Sherilee",
  "Now give me some advice about how to take full advantage of this city. I\u2019m always looking to improve my odds.\u201d\u201cJust what I\u2019d expect from a horny actuary.\u201d\u201cI\u2019m serious.\u201dCarlos reflected for a moment on the problem at hand. He actually had never needed or tried to take full advantage of the city in order to meet women, but he thought about all of his friends who regularly did. His face lit up as he thought of some helpful advice: \u201cGet into the arts.\u201d\u201cThe arts?\u201d\u201cYeah.\u201d\u201cBut I\u2019m not artistic.\u201d\u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter. Many women are into the arts. Theater. Painting. Dance. They love that stuff.\u201d\u201cYou want me to get into dance? Earthquakes have better rhythm than me\u2026And can you really picture me in those tights?\u201d\u201cTake an art history class. Learn photography. Get involved in a play or an independent film production. Get artsy, Sammy. I\u2019m telling you, the senoritas dig that stuff.\u201d\u201cReally?\u201d\u201cYeah. You need to sign up for a bunch of artistic activities. But you can\u2019t let on that it\u2019s all just a pretext to meet women. You have to take a real interest in the subject or they\u2019ll quickly sniff out your game.\u201d\u201cI don\u2019t know\u2026It\u2019s all so foreign to me\u2026I don\u2019t know the first thing about being artistic.\u201d\u201cHeeb, this is the time to expand your horizons. And you\u2019re in the perfect city to do it. New York is all about reinventing yourself. Get out of your comfort zones. Become more of a Renaissance man. That\u2019s much more interesting to women.": "Zack",
  "We sit in an awkward silence for a few minutes before she speaks. \u201cYou\u2019re right. There\u2019s more to it.\u201d I\u2019m not sure if I should wait and let her speak, or if she\u2019s waiting for an acknowledgement. I slowly turn my head toward her and settle my eyes on hers. \u201cI went through a rough time a few years ago. I wasn\u2019t sure things would get better for me. One day, Rick and Jo were able to knock some sense into me. When a Phoenix dies, it rises from its ashes to have a new life.\u201d Her eyes leave mine as she rolls to her back and stares at the stars. \u201cThe tattoo reminds me of that. One chapter of my life may end, but that doesn\u2019t mean a new chapter won\u2019t come from the ashes. It probably sounds silly to you.": "Rein",
  "But in case you can\u2019t find her let me draw you a map with some crayons, you go past leave us the fuck alone, and turn right at fuck off, and oh look you're in slut country.": "J.L.",
  "Sex does a body good.\"...\t\"I suggest a daily dose then.": "Robin",
  "I'll never look at cake the same way again,\" he whispered in her ear.": "Robin",
  "Roses are read, violets are blue; I'm using my hand, but I'm thinking of you.": "L.A.",
  "I looked to the sitting room then and gaped at Alec's body lying across my sofa making it look smaller than it was. He was reading something.A book.\"What are you readin'?\" I curiously asked.\"That porn book we were talking about earlier at my house. This dude is my God! He just fucked this Ana chick while she was on her period.\"\"Stop it!\" I screeched. \"Stop readin' and put the bloody book down!\"He was reading Fifty Shades of Grey.I was both horrified and mortified.Alec got up from the sofa, placed the book on the coffee table and turned in my direction.\"Why are you blushing?\"Him noticing my embarrassment only caused my already red cheeks to heat up even more.\"Oh damn, your cheeks are so flushed,\" Alec said and took a step towards me.": "L.A.",
  "I like my money, and if you mess with it, I fuck with you.\"I raised my eyebrow. \"You want to fuck with Alec?\"\"What? No, that's not what I meant.\"\"But you said you-\"\"I know what I said you smartass,": "L.A.",
  "Tell me you're bare underneath the dress.\"\tShe gulped. \"I'm bare underneath this dress.\"\tGently dropping her arms back to her sides, he slid his finger down the center of her chest. Tingles shot out from the tips of her breasts and gathered at the base of her spine, between her legs. \"Tell me you want me as much as I want you,\" he said, his voice husky.Never had she imagined doing something as reckless as sleeping with a guy for one night. But this wasn't any guy. And it wasn't just about her getting off--God, how she needed to do that. It was about closure. Saying goodbye on her terms. It might be a bad idea, but it was the best bad idea she'd ever had.\tShe dropped the panties and put her hands on his chest.\t\"I want you.": "Robin",
  "Gripping her hips in his hands, he thrust into her, and her eyes closed, her head tilting to the side as he pumped in and out of her, wondering how a quickie in the back of a limo could be the hottest sex he\u2019d had in a long time. It\u2019s her. It\u2019s always been her.": "Codi",
  "I felt Alec's glare so I turned to look at him and smiled when I found him all but drilling holes into me with his eyes.\"If looks could kill, I'd be dead,\" I joked.\"My pretty eyes won't harm you, don't worry.\"Conceited much?\"Did you just call your own eyes pretty?\"Alec devilishly grinned then and it made me slightly uneasy.\"No, you said I have pretty eyes.\"Was he high?\"Are you in your right mind? I have never said you have pretty eyes-\"\"Yes, you have. Right before you fell asleep. You said I have pretty eyes.\"I felt my face heat up.It was the shite he gave me to knock me out that said that, not me!\"Did I say anythin' else?\" I murmured.Alec leaned in close to me and whispered is a slow, seductive voice, \"You said you like my voice, my abs, and my ass.\"I audibly gasped. \"I did not!\"Alec snickered. \"You did.\"I was mortified, absolutely mortified!\"I hate you right now.": "L.A.",
  "Kissing Travis was like licking raw cookie dough off the spoon; it might be bad for her, but it was too delicious to care.": "Codi",
  "I do what the voices in my underwear tell me to do.\"Wait, what?\"You mean the voices in your head?\"Alec smirked. \"Yeah, the voices in my head.\"I furrowed my eyebrows together and stared at him.Why was he smirking at me?He was confusing me.Wait.Voices in his underwear.In his head.The head in his underwear.I gasped. \"You dirty bastard!": "L.A.",
  "Do you have any idea how much I love you?\" Jordan curled her hands around the lapel of his jacket and tugged him closer. In her heels, she was almost his height, and when she pressed her body against his, her mouth was a scant inch away. Jordan flicked her tongue over his lower lip and whispered. \"It might even border on obsession.": "Sara",
  "Ow!\" Aideen suddenly hollered which earned a bark from my bedroom.\"Go back asleep you fat shite!\" Aideen shouted when I swiped the antiseptic wipe over a small cut above her eye.I hissed at her, \"Leave him alone, he isn't fat. He just has a thick coat!\"Aideen laughed through her hissing. \"Yeah, a thick coat of blubber.\"I gave her a firm look. \"Don't slag me baby when I'm cleanin' you up. Me finger might slip and jam into your eye.": "L.A.",
  "But make no mistake about it, Jordan. When the time is right and you're ready\" - he trailed his forefinger along the edge of her palm and stilled when she shivered in response - \"I have every intention of getting you into bed. And sleeping will have little to do with it.": "Sara",
  "A hot man like that was made for more than friendship.": "Sara",
  "When I'm inside you, buried so deep I'm the only thing that exists in your world, that's when I'm not going to go slow. It's going to be fast and hard because I'm going to lose my mind.": "Robin",
  "I want to go slow, baby, I really do,\" he whispered at the side of her neck. \"But I'm not going to be able to this first time.\"\t\"Thank heavens.": "Robin",
  "Did you need Jordan for something, Cookie?\" Gavin asked with thinly veiled impatience. Hands back in his pockets, he took a step away from Jordan. \"Or do you merely excel at crappy timing?\"\t\"Sorry, Chief.\" Cookie's short purple-and-blue hair stuck out in a hundred different directions, and she winked when she peeked out from behind the swinging door....\t\"It's a gift.\"\t\"That's not what I would call it,\" he grumbled.": "Sara",
  "You okay?\" He moved past her into the kitchen and deposited his beer bottle in the sink. \"You're all flushed.\"\t\"I'm fine,\" she said a little too quickly. \"It's hot in here, that's all.\"\tOh sure. It was a little hot anywhere he was. The kitchen...the living room... the polar ice caps...": "Sara",
  "I want to be in the water with you again, nani girl.\" Her knees went weak and trembles raced down her spine. Beautiful girl had been a special nickname only he used.": "Robin",
  "I can walk... see.\"I made my legs walk.\"What are you doing?\"\"Vertical walkin'.\"Alec laughed. \"Pitch Perfect?\"\"Amazin' film.": "L.A.",
  "I must have a screw loose,\" she muttered under her breath. Satisfied the counter was clean, she squatted down and put the cleaning supplies away in the cabinet beneath the register. \"Yup. There's definitely something wrong with me.\"\t\"Are you looking for confirmation on that?\" Jordan's heart hitched in her chest as Gavin's familiar baritone filled the shop. \"Or am I supposed to argue with you?": "Sara",
  "Hurry,\" she breathed. \"I need you to fill me up.\"\t\"Baby, I'm gonna do more than that.": "Robin",
  "Still following the rules, huh?\" He grabbed his shift off the back of the kitchen chair and pulled it on.\"Still breaking them?\" she fired back.": "Robin",
  "My date the next night brought a sock puppet with him. A. Sock. Puppet. And he talked to me with it\"...\t\"It completely freaked me out,\" Kalani continued. \"I made it through drinks and that was more than enough. I told the guy it was a good thing he had one good hand left because if this was his usual MO for dates, he was going to need it.": "Robin",
  "His dimples should come with an advisory label: Will cause hearts to flutter and panties to spontaneously combust.": "Robin",
  "God promised men that obedient women would be found on all corners of the Earth. I've been all over the Earth, and I call bullshit on that!\" Alec snapped as he glared directly at me.I snorted. \"I hate to burst your bubble, but God also made the Earth round, he's got jokes.": "L.A.",
  "She put her hands on her hips. \"You're not human.\"\t\"Neither are you.\"\t\"I beg your pardon?\"\t\"Ethereal comes to mind.": "Robin",
  "Busted,\" she said. \"You pretend to be all rough and tough, but on the inside you're a big softie.\"\t\"I guarantee you there is nothing soft---": "Robin",
  "As long as I\u2019ve known her, she\u2019s seen the very best version of me, even when I didn\u2019t believe that guy existed.": "Amanda",
  "I rolled my eyes. \"Just go get your tattoo before I change me mind, you dirty fuck.\"Alec waggled his eyebrows. \"I'd give you a dirty fuck, kitten.": "L.A.",
  "Oh, so your middle finger has a mind of its own then?\" Alex asked with an amused look.I glared at him and said, \"Yeah, and she was just sticking up for me": "L.A.",
  "I pulled back and stared up into his eyes. \"You're gettin' very deep on me.\"Alec's hands gripped my behind. \"I'll be getting very deep in you if you keep looking at me like that": "L.A.",
  "There are no words to describe the silence that follows. I can only say this: I\u2019ve never been stabbed. But now I can imagine how it feels. The blade slides in with such precision, such sharpness that at first, there\u2019s no pain \u2013 not even a full realization of what has transpired. Then slowly, as it recedes, the dawning occurs - a shocking, detached understanding of one\u2019s own frailty. And with it comes the evidence that life is now free to flow from the body, painfully and unchecked, until there\u2019s nothing left to give.": "L.J.",
  "Having a heart that\u2019s three sizes too small must be really convenient for business.": "Naima",
  "I\u2019ve had your kiss. I know what you taste like, and that\u2019s only worsened the need. Made me crave more.": "Naima",
  "I can be ruthless, unforgiving, and a manipulative bastard. But I don\u2019t play games with sex.": "Naima",
  "I made a mistake. Men and women can\u2019t be friends. Statistically, impossible. One of the friends is always a little in love with the other or at least sexually attracted to them, and sex ruins friendships.": "Codi",
  "Heya, Arlene. What\u2019s shakin\u2019?\u201d Cotton greeted.\u201cDon\u2019t shift some of this weight, everything,\u201d Arlene replied.": "Kristen",
  "You make me crazy,\u201d she muttered as she obeyed. \u201cLikewise,\u201d he countered.": "Codi",
  "In fact, I\u2019ve been thinking; lips like that have got to be soft as a rose petal. You wouldn\u2019t mind if I tested them out, would ya, sweetheart?": "Codi",
  "Make Me Crazy. Make me nuts! I don\u2019t care as long as you\u2019re here. With me.": "Codi",
  "He couldn\u2019t stop the grin that spread across his face. Who knew Miss California would be good in a bar fight.": "Codi",
  "Oh, honey. You picked the wrong bear to poke.": "Codi",
  "You have exactly three seconds to get out of here before I do everything I\u2019ve been thinking about since the first day I saw you. You decide. Now.": "Codi",
  "What was it about this infuriating woman that reduced him to a twelve-year-old at the pool?": "Codi",
  "The trouble with sexy is people have different tastes. Some guys like girls in flashy skimoy clothes with big hair and cowboy boots. Other guys think shy girls that are less obvious are more desirable. Some guys check out her body and others look at her face. It\u2019s all about personal preference.\u201d \u201cWhat kind of girls do you like?": "Codi",
  "Look, you don\u2019t know what makes me tick, so stop assuming you do.": "Codi",
  "I hate that you went through hell for years and that you suffered. But without your past, you and I wouldn\u2019t have a future.": "Codi",
  "She didn\u2019t have to act like she couldn\u2019t wait to have him, because that was exactly what was making her slip her bra down her arms so eagerly.": "Codi",
  "Want to stay over at my place tonight?\u201d \u201cBut I don\u2019t have anything to sleep in,\u201d \u201cWho said we\u2019re going to be sleeping?": "Codi",
  "She was the best friend he\u2019d ever had, and he\u2019d tried to resist messing it up, tried not to feel anything else for her, but it was inevitable. He was meant to love Gemma Carlson.": "Codi",
  "Fiery red curls catch my attention. I\u2019ve never seen hair like hers. It\u2019s long and hangs to just above her ass, but it\u2019s not trashy looking. The curls are large and thick. If I were a descriptive man, I\u2019d almost call her hair luscious. But, I\u2019m not so I\u2019ll leave it at fiery and thick.": "Rein",
  "Being with Holden and Gavin was driving Stella mad. Mad with desire when she was with them; mad with impatience when they were apart. In their arms, she felt beautiful and desirable\u2014two things she hadn\u2019t experienced nearly enough in her lifetime. They reminded her that there was more to being a woman than complicated beauty regimens and menstrual cycles.": "Amanda",
  "Stella couldn\u2019t believe this was happening. Gavin and Holden were both in her bed and just as desperate for her as she was for them. Her life had morphed into a cross between a romance novel and a porno. If she was dreaming, she didn\u2019t ever want to wake up.": "Amanda",
  "Gavin dreamed of nothing more than spending the rest of his life safe and comfortable, and within touching distance of the two people he loved most. All it would take to achieve that goal was a miracle. Maybe he could find one if he dug deep enough under the couch cushions. Everything else he needed ended up there.": "Amanda",
  "You're very different from the man I pictured you to be.\"I smirk at her, amused. What, so she didn't think I'd be a fucker with a drinking problem who is obviously very much into casual sex and reckless driving on a classic bike? I arch an eyebrow at her and run a hand along my square jaw. \"I hope you find me sexier.": "Stephanie",
  "You\u2019re afraid, Chris. You don\u2019t let yourself trust or feel too deeply, because you don\u2019t want to be hurt. I don't want to be hurt either.\u201d ...Lindsay Reynoso": "Pamela",
  "I\u2019m not putting that in my mouth.": "Naima",
  "You\u2019re demanding fidelity, and I\u2019ll give you that. But if I intended to be celibate, I would\u2019ve become a priest.": "Naima",
  "Wiping my sleeve over my eyes, I clear the tears and smile at her. \u201cYea. I\u2019m great.\u201d Leaning over the bed, I lay a gentle kiss over her mouth. It\u2019s not meant as a sexual kiss, rather a reverent kiss to show her how much I love her. But, if that didn\u2019t convey my message, I move to her ear and whisper. \u201cI love you so much. Thank you for this baby.\u201d I bury by head in her neck while still holding her hand tightly. Her free hand strokes my head and tangles in my hair.": "Rein",
  "Since he didn\u2019t seem to understand the situation, I felt it my duty to enlighten him. \u201cWrong. You started this stupid rumor and half the school probably believes it\u2019s true. Now you have to stick around and pretend to be my boyfriend to convince everyone I don\u2019t have sex with random guys. Not to mention the fact that if you\u2019d kept your mouth shut about getting laid, you wouldn\u2019t be in this situation.\u201dHe raised a brow. \u201cSo you\u2019re my punishment?": "Chris",
  "If you find someone who makes you feel like you're complete, you need to fight for them.": "Veronica",
  "Bryce looked like a California underwear model. Not that I\u2019d thought about him in his underwear.Much.He was talking with his friend Nathan. Where Bryce had the whole tan, blond, hazel-eyed thing going on, Nathan was fair with dark hair and dark eyes. They looked like opposite sides of the same coin. A really hot, totally unreachable coin that a collector would keep in a special locked case, which normal girls like myself were not allowed to touch.": "Chris",
  "In an unexpected move, Bryce reached for my hand and pulled me to his side. \u201cPlay along. We\u2019ll straighten this out later.\u201dGood Lord, the school hottie was touching me. It felt like I\u2019d won some sort of geek-girl lottery. And depending on how this played out, Bryce could be the answer to my boyfriend problems. If he wanted me to cover for him, then he needed to help me with my overprotective brothers.": "Chris",
  "I saw you the second I walked into the bar that night. I saw you and felt you were different.\u201dHis lips had moved so close to hers that if she edged forward a bit, his mouth would be on hers. \u201cI\u2019m actually not different,\u201d she said, hating that her voice sounded all breathy and nervous. \u201cI\u2019m similar to lots of people. I can even list off a bunch of people who look like me. And these boots aren\u2019t really kick-ass boots. I bought them because they were on the clearance rack.\u201dA smile tugged at the corner of his mouth before his lips touched hers, and all her carefully constructed reasons as to why she\u2019d never get involved with a man like Matt burned to ashes.": "Victoria",
  "With his blond hair, broad shoulders, and perpetual tan,Bryce looked like a California underwear model. Not that I\u2019d thought about him in his underwear.Much.": "Chris",
  "Christ, woman, were you ever going to say anything?\u201dHe grabbed her by the wrist and tugged her down the hall tothe single bathroom. \u201cGet out of that shirt.": "Aliyah",
  "Maybe I should put an ad online. Honor student seeks overly self-confident young man for fake relationship. Terms negotiable.": "Chris",
  "She shook her head. \u201cI won\u2019t go.\u201dHis chuckle had absolutely no humor in it. \u201cYou say thatas if you have a choice.\u201d\u201cThere is always a choice.": "Aliyah",

  "Is there a problem? I mean, I wasn't expecting you, or anyone, tonight.\"Drew held out a hand to help her from the car, snatching it back when she got out on her own.\"There is a problem.\"\"What?\" He tensed. \"Did M.J. come back? Is he giving you trouble?\"\"I can handle my brother.\"Tyler moved closer. Drew stepped back, his eyes suddenly wary. Sighing she grabbed the front of his t-shirt, the fingers of her other hand threading through his thick, dark hair. Soft. She remembered the feel like it was yesterday. Her hope had been that he would as eager as she was. The attraction was still there, it was time to do something about it. Apparently he wasn't going to make this easy. So she did what she had all those years ago when he wouldn't make the first move\u2014she kissed him first.Prime rib to a starving man. Ten years without even a taste, Drew couldn't help but devour her.The kiss was primal, out of control. Mouths seeking the angle after angle, tongues duelings. And the way Tyler tasted. Sweet and spicy and utterly delicious.In his dreams, he imagined this differently. Slower. He would show her how a man kissed as opposed to the boy he had been. One touch of her lips on his and all those grand plans flew out the window along with any common sense he ever possessed. Tyler was in his arms. Familiar yet new. He needed her and he was never letting go.Drew's hands went under the hem of her shirt slowly sliding up her smooth, hot skin. He could feel the erotic combination of vulnerability and strength in the subtle muscles of her back. She had filled out, they both had. He wanted to spend days discovering all the differences then start all over again, just in case he missed something the first time.The kiss was neverending though the desperation, instead of lessening, scaled higher. He could lift her into his arms, carry her into the house, rip every scrap of clothing from her delicious body and fuck for hours.Fuck. Well, fuck.The word wasn't exactly a bucket of cold water, the desperate heat running through his veins needed more than that. But it did lift the haze. If he didn't stop this right now, there would be no turning back.\"Tyler.\"The word sounded foreign, all guttural. His voice was hoarse with passion and his body was calling every swear word known to man. Why are you stopping? Beautiful woman. Willing. Her hands all over you. Right now she was reaching between his legs. The first caress was almost his undoing. It felt so good, so right. No could touch him like Tyler.The sexual haze enveloped him again. Don't fight it, his body urged. Feel her lips on your jaw, your neck. God. Her teeth biting your earlobe. That alone brought him close to going over the top. Damn his good intentions. Talking was way overrated. Pulling her in until their bodies were flush and he could feel every long, luscious inch of her\u2014plastered against him. Drew was going in for another kiss when her words did what his own reasoning couldn't. It wasn't a bucket of cold water, it was a fire hose\u2014turned on full blast.\"Fuck me, Drew. Right here, up against my car. Let's get this thing done, once and for all.": "Mary",
  "Bryce Colton is telling everyone you hooked up after the bonfire Friday night.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d Everyone in the parking lot turned and stared. Okay, maybe I said that a little loud. I hooked my arm through Jane\u2019s and steered her toward the sidewalk. \u201cI went to the bonfire with you. Do you remember seeing me naked with Bryce Colton?\u201dShe pouted and kicked a rock off the sidewalk. \u201cI thought maybe you went back after you dropped me off.\u201d\u201cWhy do you sound disappointed?\u201d\u201cIt would be nice if one of us had a sex life.\" I laughed so hard I snorted. That\u2019s one of the reasons I\u2019m best friends with Jane. I never know what she\u2019s going to say.": "Chris",
  "You drive me crazy in all the damn good ways that keep me up at night,\u201d he whispered. He cupped her jaw, his eyes going to her mouth. He could see her pulse racing at the base of her neck and she didn\u2019t move away when he bent his head. \u201cThe best ways, Kate,\u201d he said and then kissed her like he\u2019d wanted to since the moment she\u2019d ran into him that afternoon, since the moment she\u2019d left him the other night. He kissed her, tasted her, wrapped her up in his arms, and tangled his hands in her hair until he couldn\u2019t think.": "Victoria",
  "He wanted her. Here, now, between growing vines and fallen leaves, in the rain and the mud. Anywhere.And she wanted him, too.": "Pamela",
  "Do you want to have to tell the doctor at the emergency room that the reason your wound opened up was because you couldn't keep your you know what in your pants.\" \"First of all, I don't think I'd have to say you know what in front of the doctor.": "Mary",

  "The elevator doors had barely shut before Olivia's fingers were at the buckle of the belt cinching the waist of her trench dress.

She was the wild Sweet triplet, the one voted most likely to do anything, and all she wanted to do right now was Mateo.": "Avery",
  "His gaze dropped down to the deep V of her cherry-red top and the pulse in his temple pulsed. For a second she didn't think he was going to say anything, which was good because she'd just forgotten her own name. His focus inched northward across her generous cleavage, up her neck and to her lips -- leaving a heated trail across her skin without ever making a move. The last dry spot on her panties surrendered.": "Avery",
  "You are nothing but trouble.\"\tIf he'd meant to censure her, then he had the wrong girl. Trouble wasn't a dirty word when you were a Sweet.": "Avery",
  "Maybe it's time to stop punishing yourself for past sins.\"\tHe wished it was that easy, but it wasn't. So if he was already this deep in, what was one more transgression? Snagging the hem of her tank top between two fingers, he tugged it taut. \"I suppose you think you're the woman to show me the way?\"\tLeaning in close, she whispered into his good ear, \"No one knows more about sinning than a Sweet.": "Avery",
  "Don't worry, I'll figure out a way to make you pay me back.\" His stomach growled as he turned onto Main Street. \"But first, dinner and then some pie.\"\t\"I don't know what Ruby Sue puts in it, but it's addictive.\" She giggled. \"I think you need to investigate.\"\t\"If by 'investigate', you mean eat it, then I'm all for it.": "Avery",
  "You are nothing but trouble.\u201d": "\u201dMaybe",
  "I'm just an asshole Marine...I'm not the kind of guy people like you should depend on.": "Avery",
  "She drank in the sight of him, sure that anything so perfect had to be a dream. He seemed bigger with just a towel wrapped around his waist. It was amazing what wonders clothing could hide. Over six feet of long muscled male. Bronzed skin, lightly dusted with hair seemed to glow as he walked towards her. He moved like an athlete. Strong, confident strides that ate up the distance between them in no time. Her hands wanted to touch him, anywhere, everywhere. His impossibly flat, firm stomach seemed to call out for her mouth to trace the ridges; her tongue eagerly memorizing every smooth, muscled inch. \u201cLose the towel.\u201d She wasn\u2019t asking, she was pleading. Jack let the cloth fall to the floor. Eyes wide Rose gasped. Mother Nature had been very kind to Jack Winston, and she was about to be a very grateful beneficiary. \u201cRose, sweetheart,\u201d Jack stepped back when she would have touched him. \u201cOh, come on, Jack,\u201d she groaned in frustration. \u201cI\u2019ve been a very good girl. Now it\u2019s time for my reward.": "Mary",

  "Lily?\u201d She couldn\u2019t see his face, but she knew his eyes were on her. She could feel them. A beat passed. Then another.

  "You\u2019re killing me in this proper little suit,\u201d he said, skating a heated look over her shirt. \u201cMy place or yours?\u201d She swallowed thickly, the hand against his chest beginning to sweat. \u201cI-I\u2019m busy.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re gonna be,\u201d he said, smiling. \u201cNeed to know what bed you\u2019re gonna be in, though. Bringing my A game.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t you think\u2014?\u201d \u201cAbout you underneath me? Only every other minute. Now answer me, or else I\u2019ll throw you on the nearest desk.\u201d Heat burst onto her cheeks. He noticed. \u201cOh, really?\u201d He smiled down at her.": "Jessica",
  "What the hell are you doing with my underwear?\u201d He kept his response flippant. \u201cI don\u2019t have this color in my collection.": "Miranda",
  "Say my name.\"\"No.\" She tipped her head up, her breath sawing out of her lungs. \u201cDon\u2019t stop, please.\u201d He languidly stroked her. \u201cI won\u2019t stop, but I won\u2019t take you there unless you say it.\u201d Her voice locked in her throat. He stroked into her again at the same time giving her the pressure she desired with his thumb. \u201cI have all night.": "Jessica",
  "He drew in an answering breath, and she waited to hear the quip, the joke, the dab of levity for the most intense moment they\u2019d ever shared. But he only dropped his head into the crook of her neck and laid his mouth over her leaping pulse as they found their unhurried rhythm in the dark.": "Jessica",
  "This is good,\u201d he told her.\u2028She gave him a slow blink. \u201cYou like wine?\u201d\u2028\u201cDoesn\u2019t everyone?\u201d\u2028\u201cYou strike me as a beer-from-the-can kind of guy.\u201d\u2028\u201cI am.\u201d\u2028": "Jessica",
  "It\u2019s not over, Maddie. It\u2019s still not over between us. We need to talk.": "Miranda",
  "They\u2019d used sex instead of communication in the past, and it had turned out disastrously.": "Miranda",
  "Whatever you say, sweetheart.\u201d He sent her a wink, a devilish one, the same one he no doubt used to sear the panties off his dates.": "Jessica",
  "How was it that the one man who could take their company down appeared to be the only one who believed in her?": "Miranda",
  "Taking over Kingston Shoes would be the final string that would unravel and cut them off from one another for good.": "Miranda",
  "He was making up a story, and she was buying into his bullshit. That was a recipe for disaster": "Miranda",
  "Dear God, she was getting turned on in the middle of a roadside emergency. This had to stop.": "Miranda",
  "She\u2019d vowed to be braver and take more risks, but this seemed out of her league. Because sometimes what you wanted the most was the one thing you were most afraid to get.": "Miranda",
  "Leaving the feasibility of testicular transplants alone for the moment, she said, \u201cIt was mostly my mistake.": "Teri",
  "ROSE FELT LIKE she had a neon sign flashing over her head\u2014looking for a one night stand, only sex gods need apply.": "Mary",
  "Ah, here\u2019s my SUV.\u201d He made sure her dress was tucked into the car before shutting her door. \u201cI\u2019ll wait for you just down the road and then you can follow me home. Oh, and Jack? This is a one night only invitation. If you\u2019re not okay with that keep on driving.": "Mary",
  "Rose was drowning in pleasure like she\u2019d never known, just from a kiss. Jack wasn\u2019t touching her any place but on the lips and yet she could feel it on every inch of her body. Long, sure strokes of his tongue made her ache for him to explore the rest of her with equal thoroughness. She needed to touch him, why wasn\u2019t she touching him?": "Mary",
  "She was feeling so much all at once and yet she wanted so much more. She wanted Jack\u2014naked\u2014now. \u201cI\u2019m going to leave you, Rose.\u201d She heard the words, but it took a moment for the meaning to register. Leaving? Was He leaving?": "Mary",
  "No angel. The reason I went with all them girls was to try and get over you. I wake up to you everyday. you send my mind and body into frenzy. I can smell your hair when I close my eyes, or I can imagine how your hand feels when you lay it on my chest. It kills me everyday to be so close to you, but be so far away.": "Kirsty",
  "He moved his head closer to mine and then stopped, his lips a few millimetres away from mine. I couldn't breathe, my heart was racing, but not from the usual fear I had. It was because I wanted to kiss him": "Kirsty",
  "There's no question how strong you are.\" Gabe rested his fingers on her shoulders and pressed into the tight muscles. She didn't push him away. \"But being strong doesn't mean you have to be alone.": "Kishan",
  "You. Aren\u2019t you one of those Morgan boys? You must be the bad one.": "Teri",
  "She glared at me. I didn't care. One word was playing a loop in my heaad: mine.": "Kristen",
  "It's just a kiss, she mentally swore. But kiss was much too simple a word to call the powerful connection that simply rocked her world.": "Tamara",
  "It's always been you": "it'll",
  "If there was anything he\u2019d learned in his life, it was to fight fire with fire, and if that didn\u2019t work, piss on the fire to put it out.": "Marissa",
  "Locks or no locks, you're not going to cage me in.": "Collette",
  "I'm not leaving until you stop crying\" he stated pulling me down so we were now laying on my bed facing each other": "Kirsty",
  "Stop,\u201d he murmured, or at least that\u2019s what he meant to say. It came out sounding more like \u201cYes,\u201d which probably wasn\u2019t the same thing at all.": "Tawna",
  "You need to have a work with your friend, seriously, she just grabbed my dick!' He whisper yelled at me": "Kirsty",
  "She came out of nowhere like a two-by-four against the skull, knocking all common sense out of him and turning him into a walking woody.": "Marissa",
  "Claire, if you don\u2019t move, I will have served two tours of duty only to die in this bed.": "Marissa",
  "This will be the way I\u2019ll be remembering you, Kel,\u201d he whispered softly into her ear, \u201cin this beautiful place, where all that I\u2019m thinking about it how much I want you.": "Tamara",
  "There was magic in the air tonight, and something incredible was about to happen\u2013Kelly just sensed it.": "Tamara",
  "Lust was edging confusion for the lead. Good sense had fallen far behind.": "Teri",
  "Her voice was as soft and sexy as ever. Those wide-setblue eyes every bit as distrustful as they\u2019d been during his lastencounter with her, which meant that chip on her shoulder, theone he\u2019d tried so desperately to dislodge, remained firmly in place.": "Jackie",
  "He ate one of my bras.\u201d\u201cAh. I see. Which one?\u201d\u201cAn underwire,\u201d she mumbled.\u201cThe black lacey one from Victoria\u2019s Secret?\u201dShe folded her arms. \u201cThat would be the one.\u201dWell, no one could fault the dog\u2019s taste, Gid thought. Thatstingy bit of lace had always looked plenty appetizing to him, too.He forced his mind back to the matter at hand.": "Jackie",
  "Heart...Soul...Words": "Leslie",
  "For my little dog, Pip, who joined our family during the writing ofthis story. Thanks for rescuing me.": "Jackie",
  "I have one promise I can make you, Kate.\u201d He reached for her hair, coiled some of it around his hand, and used it to pull her toward him.\u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d she whispered breathlessly. Not so cocky now.\u201cYou\u2019re going to enjoy this.": "Jackie",
  "Wanting Kate was one thing. Sex was simple. Or it could be. But liking her?Enjoying spending time with her? Allowing her into his private life, as Brody had tonight, albeit at his sisters\u2019 invitation? It would lead to nothing but trouble.": "Jackie",
  "She had no doubt in her mind what he was going to do. And while her ever-elusive shred of common sense squealed, \u201cno,\u201d every thing else in her shouted, \u201cBring it on.": "Marissa",
  "How did you know the dog was a boy before you read the tag?\u201dLooking up at him with her cinnamon-colored eyes, she stated very matter-of-factly, \u201cBoys have penises.\u201d At that moment, Michael was very aware that he, himself, was a boy.": "Marissa",
  "She unzipped her oversized flannel onesie, created especially for women not interested in finding a man, and tossed it on the bed.": "Kishan",
  "She got me to crack open the window to my soul, and I really don't want to slam it down on her fingers just yet.": "Collette",
  "\u2026It was like he waved his magic wang, and I totally forgot how I\u2019m not a gullible teenager anymore.": "Teri",
  "Movement means freedom. That's what life's all about.": "Collette",
  "Loving someone wasn't about their perfection. It was about coming to accept every part of them, their good qualities at their weaknesses and flaws--looking on everything they were and loving it all.As she looked on everything Jake was, right down to his center, she loved him.": "Becky",
  "He wanted desperately to stay, just a little while longer. But he couldn't be here, in this place, with her. It was calm here. She was innocent and beautiful and perfect. He was not. He didn't want his mess or his mental illness or his past anywhere near her. He wanted to protect her from a lot of things, but most of all from himself.": "Becky",
  "He'd sacrifice even his sanity for her. If it came down to it, he'd let her break his heart.Because he loved her.": "Becky",
  "Oh my god.\u201dHe didn\u2019t turn or say anything even though the frustration in Honor\u2019s voice made it difficult.\u201cMy pants are stuck. I don\u2019t think I can get them off without some help. Jesus, wet jeans are heavy and uncooperative.\u201dA grin stretched across his face. \u201cYou want my help?\u201dShe let out a deep breath. \u201cYes, but you have to close your eyes.\u201d\u201cYou going commando tonight?\u201d he teased.\u201cNo, but\u2026\u201dHe shut his eyes and turned. She took his outstretched hand and tugged him down to the ground. Once there, she helped him latch on to the bunched up denim at her thighs, he guessed. Do not peek, Bishop. Do not peek.\u201cBut?\u201d\u201cMy panties are white and now see-through and there\u2019s not a lot to them.\u201d\u201cGotcha.\u201d There wasn\u2019t a red-blooded man alive who wouldn\u2019t peek. \u201cLet\u2019s get these off you.\u201d He pulled, she pushed and wiggled, and he got the pants to her feet in no time.\u201cThank you,\u201d she said, a little out of breath.\u201cNo problem.\u201d\u201cBryce!\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d Christ, she had sexy legs, and the barely-there material at their juncture left little to the imagination, so his thoughts leaped to about a dozen dirty scenarios.\u201cYour eyes are open!": "Robin",
  "She's an adversary, but undeniably an equal. Maybe she can bring me back from the beyond. If anyone can do it, I'm beginning to realize it could be her. Like she said, all I have to do is try.": "Collette",
  "His smile, a little mischievous around the edges, had her melting into the sand. Then his lips brushed hers, and the stars collided. She cupped his face in her hands and shut her eyes.Kissing had always ranked high on her list of favorite things to do, but Bryce took it to a whole new level. Forget about his mouth on her fingertips, this linked to all her happy zones and more.He'd literally swept her off her feet and his kiss quickened the beat of her heart. His lips were soft and warm and hungry. His kiss moved through her like warm honey, filling all the places inside her that had been cold for so long. He slid his tongue along the seam of her lips, licking her before he pressed further. She willingly opened to him, stroked his tongue, kissed him harder. He groaned. He tasted like champagne and everything good as he delved deeper and committed a full-on assault inside her mouth. His hand gripped her waist. They sank further into the sand.She clutched his shoulders, smoothed her palms down his back. He pulled gruffly away, nipped at her ear. \"You have no idea how much I want you,\" he said.": "Robin",
  "He caught her elbow before she'd taken more than a few steps. \"Are you walking home?\"\"Yes.\"\"It's,\" he glanced at his watch, \"nine o'clock.\"She shrugged out of his hold and continued on her way. \"The Boogeyman doesn't come out until ten, so I'm good.": "Robin",
  "Regret isn't real,\" Tuck said. \"It's something invented to punish ourselves.": "Robin",
  "He wanted nothing to do with her. He wanted everything to do with her.": "Robin",
  "You saw where I come from. No matter what I do or how I act, I'll always be the scum of the earth. I am who I am, and there's nothing you or anybody else can do to change that.": "Collette",
  "She picked up a taco, took a big bite, and moaned as it made its way down to her stomach. \"I want to marry this taco.\"\"Lucky taco.\"Honor stilled. That voice. That one-of-a-kind masculine scent. Bryce stood right behind her.": "Robin",
  "I can't give up on anyone either, even someone who's burned every bridge like Drake Schultz. Getting him to deal with his insecurities and whatever it is he's trying to hide. It's this never-ending cycle of self-hatred that I have to address before I can even think about doing anything else with him. I have to put him to the test. Just how far gone is he? How good of a liar has he become?": "Collette",
  "I may be clean cut on the outside, but make no mistake... I like to get very, very dirty when nobody's looking.": "Robin",
  "I think it's our obligation to play, Honor. It's just a game, so can I kiss you?\u201d\"Yes.\"\"Plan on one minute in heaven, Honor.\" A split second later his lips were on hers.": "Robin",
  "I'm sure nothing more exciting will happen beyond finding some Roman ruins beneath the pasture,\" Gunner predicted, an excellent example of why he would never be called psychic in any understanding of the word.": "Katie",
  "You're handsome and you have a nice accent, and a chest that would make a nun perspire.": "Katie",
  "I have a bra on,\" I said helpfully.\"I noticed. Might I remove that, too?\"\"Gunner,\" I said sternly, or as sternly as a person could while she stood in a man's castle, her hands full of his ass. \"You've got your hands on my boobs, and your tongue down my cleavage. At this point if I'm not yelling for the police, you can probably take it for granted that you have my consent to remove my bra.\"\"I like to make sure,\" he said, pulling his head out of my breasts for a moment. \"Some women have limits.": "Katie",
  "He flashed a grin over his shoulder at me. \"Ready to be astounded?\"I eyed him. \"You're not going to drop your trousers and demand I admire your gorgeous testicles, are you?\"\"Not after you disparaged their beauty.": "Katie",
  "Stop lusting after my brother, wife.\" Elliott said without looking up from where a laptop sat on a large desk. \"Else I'll have to get the parrot out.": "Katie",
  "Do they expect us to have sex right here on the kitchen table?\"Gunner, who was chewing a piece of toast, paused, considered the idea, and then shook his head. \"Too messy. We'd get sugar everywhere. Plus, Cressy might walk in, and then I'd have to get her a second horse.": "Katie",
  "I jolt up, a scream lodged in my throat. Drops of sweat roll down my forehead and my throat hurts as if I've been screaming for a long time.": "Ashley",
  "I think it\u2019s cool that you care about your heritage, but yet you don\u2019t conform. Promise me that no matter what happens, you\u2019ll never lose that feisty, impulsive side of you.": "Cindi",
  "I have to say that you're the last person I'd have expected would have a seventeen-year-old daughter. You're so...\" Alice stopped, suddenly looking guilty.\"Dashing?\" Gunner supplied. \"Debonair?\"\"A bit of a dawg, actually.": "Katie",
  "Gunner Ainslie made a face at his sister-in-law. \"'Amateur' is a bit rough, Alice. I took a degree in archaeology, after all.\"She looked even more confused. \"Then why are you a photographer now instead of an archaeologist?\"\"Because he didn't want to be a burden to the estate like all my other siblings,\" his brother Elliott, the current Baron Ainslie, answered, giving his wife a squeeze. \"Or so he said. Frankly, I think it was a cover so he could take pictures of unclothed women.": "Katie",
  "The cute little fish had big eyes and a rounded body with black polka dots and fins on either side of him that fluttered like hummingbird wings.\"He's staring at me.\"\"He knows a beautiful thing when he sees it.": "Robin",
  "Give me a few minutes,\" he said, sounding tired but happy, \"before I make good on my promises.\"She circled his nipple with her finger. \"That's a pretty short recovery time.\"\"You inspire me.": "Robin",
  "I may be clean cut on the outside, but make no mistake.\" He moved even closer, close enough to see her pulse jump at the base of her neck. \"I like to get very, very dirty when nobody's looking.": "Robin",
  "Are you one of those fifty-shades-of-bondage people? I haven't been into that in the past, but I might be willing to try with you. Although I would want to be the one to do the bondaging, while you would have to be the bondagee.": "Katie",
  "When I look at you, you know what I see?\"I met her gaze, finding it suddenly hard to breathe.\"I see the guy who saw me when no one else did,\" she said. \"That's what matters to me. That's who you are.": "Cindi",
  "I've lied all my life. I'm just now learning how to tell the truth, and I'm not going to start playing games again, especially not with you.": "Collette",
  "When I love, I love hard. You\u2019re stuck with me for good. In your news report, you didn\u2019t say what happened at the end of the bumpy ride. You didn\u2019t say what it takes to break the curse. But I know. True Love. the kind that doesn\u2019t go away because of a few disasters along the way. I love you, Melissa.": "Jennifer",
  "He covered my hand with his. \"No matter what happens, we're friends first. I hope you know how much having you in my life means to me.": "Cindi",
  "Mind-blowing sex?\" I couldn't believe I'd asked, but how could I not? It was like dangling a giant slice of chocolate cake in front of a hungry person on a diet and telling them not to take a bite.": "Cindi",
  "You're my friend who happens to be pretty and female. You do realize being your friend doesn't mean I don't have a penis?": "Cindi",
  "Quinton: I think if every person had a Nova Reed in this world, then life would be a little sunnier.": "Jessica",
  "Excuse me? Do you mind if I sit next to you? This spot has the best view of...\" I glanced out the window. \"The... gravel roof.": "Cindi",
  "You went to a party, did a keg stand, and got so drunk you forgot half the night. Congrats on this amazing milestone in your life.\" He squeezed my leg. \"What are you gonna do next?\"\"Uh, Disneyland?": "Cindi",
  "I couldn't imagine choosing shopping when sex was an option.": "Cindi",
  "I haven't done anything you're supposed to do. Like get so drunk you puke and don't remember the rest of the night.\"\"Overrated, I swear.\"She looked at me, that deadly look on her face, and I held up my hands. \"Fine. You wanna get drunk and puke, I'm not gonna stop you.\"\"But I want to do, like more than just drinking.\" Her brow furrowed and I could practically see the wheels in her brain spinning. \"I should make a list and outline a plan.\"I was going to point out that list-making wasn't the best way to let loose, but I decided to let it go.": "Cindi",
  "For the record, you would've been my first one night stand.": "Robin",
  "I\u2019ve done things I\u2019m not proud of and I\u2019m trying really hard to make up for those things by being a decent guy. And decent guys don\u2019t act the way I\u2019ve been acting around you, so I\u2019m going to stop.": "Sabrina",
  "Why didn't you tell me I had syrup on my face?\" Lyla asked when I settled behind the steering wheel. Her tongue darted out, licking the corner of her lip. I went to put the key in the ignition and missed.": "Cindi",
  "As for the making out with strangers, that was a one-time thing. Jeff keeps texting, and I feel bad, but I've been ignoring him -- the kissing was just so awful.\"\"Yeah, he'd probably not be a good choice for number seven either.": "Cindi",
  "When I mentioned that I'd always wanted to have sex against the wall with a woman in a skirt, she said, \"Well, how convenient. I just so happen to have a skirt on, and there are several walls in here.": "Cindi",
  "I think it's our obligation to play, Honor. It's just a game, so can I kiss you?": "Robin",
  "If you're so into backsides, you should have become a doctor, so you could see a new one every day.\"\"I don't want to see everybody's,\" he said from behind her, so close his breath brushed her neck. \"I have standards, and let me tell you, in those tight jeans, you've met and exceeded every one of them.": "Sara",
  "Spoon with me, and I'll show you what a good cuddler I am.": "Sara",
  "If you're so into badsides, you should have become a doctor, so you could see a new one every day.\"\t\"I don't want to see everybody's,\" he said from behind her, so close his breath brushed her neck. \"I have standards, and let me tell you, in those tight jeans, you've met and exceeded every one of them.": "Sara",
  "Sweetheart, I\u2019ve been there with you through all of it. I was the one who camped out with you in that old tree house for days on end and held you after your mom died. It was me who sat with you while we waited for your sister to come out of the surgery that cut out her cancer. I was the one holding your hand while we waited for those test results to come back, and I was the one who supplied the alcohol to get you drunk, and the shoulder to cry on while you processed it. I understand. You don\u2019t have to do this alone.": "Katee",
  "Is that a baton in your pocket, officer, or are you just happy to see me?": "Katee",
  "Tonight isn\u2019t for the baby. This is just you and me.": "Katee",
  "I love you. I\u2019ve loved you since I was sixteen years old, and I\u2019ll love you until the day I die. And I just\u2026 needed you to know that.": "Cindi",
  "That's just it. What if I can't protect you? I'll be outnumbered, outgunned. What if I can't get you out of there?": "Collette",
  "Are you ready to go to the bedroom?\"\t\"I thought you'd never ask.\" He winked.": "Sara",
  "Hell yeah, Alex Cortez wanted to be the best man at his sister's destination wedding. A party in Jamaica or maybe Bora Bora. Bring it on, baby.\tThen Luciana had hit him with the real destination: the dilapidated farm in Iowa where they'd grown up.\tHell. No.\tExcept he couldn't decline, not after she'd waited a full year while he completed his last tour with the Marines so he could attend.": "Sara",
  "...There's a bit of a difference between a guy lying back being all sexy and come hither and mmrowr-worthy, and a man who has a toy stuffed parrot hanging from his nips.": "Katie",
  "Stiff, huh? I think seeing you roll around on the floor in that tight little outfit accomplished that.": "Collette",
  "Let's get you into a room and conduct our own chemistry experiment,\" he said against my lips.\"Or maybe we'll just find a table to bend you over, since chemists do it on a table... periodically.\"\"Mmm. I love it when you talk nerdy to me.": "Cindi",
  "You\u2019re the one sitting there with a boner. You\u2019llterrify your charity guys, walking in with that thing pointingat them.": "Sherilee",
  "Get married because you can\u2019t imagine another day without talking with that person, because that person makes your day sunnier. Don\u2019t get married because you don\u2019t want to be alone.": "Lynne",
  "So you're saying your kissing me back was just a pity thing? Because it sure didn't feel that way to me.": "Collette",
  "I told you. I don't do soft and gentle.": "Collette",
  "Without you, I\u2019m not me. Something inside that I didn\u2019t even know about is broken without you.": "Roxanne",
  "It\u2019s about showing someone you care for them, wanting them to care for you, doing things they like because you want them to be happy. Because their happiness makes you happy. That\u2019s love, Dane. That\u2019s how you\u2019ll win\u2026your daughter over.": "Roxanne",
  "Love comes in seemingly insignificant moments and if you\u2019re not paying attention, you might miss them.": "Roxanne",
  "You need something more from me\u2014something I wasn't able to give you before.": "Collette",
  "Anything she might have said died in her throat at the sight of him. His black hair was disheveled, his morning stubble hypnotic, and the rakish way his shirt was undone at the throat and his tie hung in abandoned disarray beneath the collar, was just plain panty-melting.I\u2019m not wearing any panties.": "Christina",
  "Once his life had been like this. He applied strength and determination to a messy problem until the stickiness went away, strands of sense formed and suddenly a hopeless mess was transformed into something beautiful, delectable, something everyone wanted.Now, no matter how hard he tried, no one wanted what he had to offer.": "Roxanne",
  "How did pretty little Anna go from Westchester suburb brat to New York hooker? Now that\u2019s a story.": "Stacey",
  "I've heard this attributed to Calvin Coolidge. \"Behold the turtle. He never gets anywhere unless he sticks his neck out.": "Mike",
  "Elliot - Elliot waved absently, making a decision right then and there. He'd take the trip that Patrick offered. A cruise down Europe's most famous rivers couldn't be any more disruptive than home, after all.Alice -I stood up shaking the laptop at nothing. \"He made me think we were going to get married at the end of this trip! He had me look up the laws for Americans getting married in Budapest!\"\"Ball-hanging is too good for him. He serves something worse. Off with his head!\"\"I will take that trip!\" I yelled at the small living room filled with boxes that I had yet to unpack. \"And I will enjoy myself! A lot!": "Katie",
  "It could have been quite worse,\" he agreed magnanimously.\t\"And those two guys who felt up your butt while the maintenance dude was working on that hinge were kicked out because they violated the 'must have fondler's consent' rule, or so that pink-haired woman who spoke English said, so at least they won't do that to the next guy trapped in the stocks.\"\t\"I will sleep easier knowing that.": "Katie",
  "Hell,\" he said, looking down his body. \"I shouldn't have thought about that just yet. Now Alice is going to come out of the bathroom and see you standing there being demanding. That's not very gentlemanly....\"\tThis just made him even harder.\tWith a sigh, he snatched up her pirate hat and slapped it over his crotch. \"There. Now we can at least present the semblance of a man who doesn't have a single track mind.": "Katie",
  "I have a hat for it, actually.\" Elliott made a vague gesture with one hand. \"Well, it's more of a full-body suit, really.\"\t\"Is that a euphemism for a condom?\"\t\"No.\" He marched past me and lay down on the bed. \"My mother knitted me a willy-warmer a few years back when we were having a cold stretch. She felt I wasn't like to produce the grandchildren she desires if I had as she put it, frost-shriveled parts.": "Katie",
  "Are you going to last if I start nibbling at your ankles and work my way up?\"\t\"No. You might make it to my knee, but only if I think about starving children and venereal warts.": "Katie",
  "You are such a stick-in-the-mud sometimes, you know that?\" My annoyance faded. Elliott, poor man, truly believe what he was saying. He thought life was better when it was organized and structured until all the fun had been squeezed out of it. \"Look, one of the things I've learned from life is that you have to grab what you can take, because you never know if it'll be there later. I'm here right now. So are you. And I just bet you if I stick my hands down your pants, you'll be ready for a little fun in no time.\"\tHis nostrils flared, and his voice took on that haughty lord-of-the-manor tone that made me want to giggle. \"I assure you, madam, that I am in full control of my libido. If I did not wish to become aroused by you, I wouldn't.\"\tI put my hand on his fly. Just that, no caressing, no stroking, just my palm on his zipper. I could feel him getting hard within seconds. I cocked an eyebrow at him.\t\"As it happens, I want to be aroused,\" he said with an attempt at dignity. \"I have decided that I will, just this once, bend my inviolable rule about not stopping until I am done with my daily quota of writing.": "Katie",
  "The thought struck me, as I went about my daily ablutions, that Elliot had awfully nice hair for a man who\u2019d take someone else\u2019s ticket. It wasn\u2019t long, but had a small curl to it that made you think about running your fingers through it. \u201cNot that I have any intention of doing so ,\u201d I told my reflection in the steam mirror. \u201cEven if I was looking for a man, and I\u2019m certainly not that stupid, he would be off the table. He\u2019s friend to a rat bastard.\u201d It was just a shame, too. How many bona fide lords does a girl meet? And how many of them have BBC voices, and nice faces, and curly hair that looks soft and silky and utterly gropeworthy?": "Katie",
  "I'm wondering why I thought it was a good idea to fill my purse with eggs.\"He blinked at me.\tI pulled a cold, flabby fried egg from mny bag, followed by its twin, holding them up so he could see. \"Eggs.\"\t\"You couldn't carry a packet of peanuts like a normal person?\" he asked.\tI smiled. \"I've never done normal particularly well....": "Katie",
  "I would totally support a pond scene like the one in PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, but only if you were stripped first.\"\tHe slid her a glance out of the corner of his eye. She was giving him a lascivious grin that made him feel like singing at the top of his lungs. \"You have a smutty mind, Alice. It's one of the many things I admire in you. Unfortunately, we are in a holy place, and although I don't particularly hold strong religious feelings, I feel it would be insulting to the caretakers of this cathedral to give in to your lustful desires and engage in sex right her and now.\" He thought for a moment. \"Although I have to admit it is a tempting thought...": "Katie",
  "I don't know whether to be pleased that our lovemaking was of such a high quality that you immediately want more, or if it's an indication you are one of those sex-addicted people who are never satisfied.": "Katie",
  "...I was enjoying conducting highly charged sexual banter with you.\"\t\"As was I, although if we continue along that line, you're going to make it extremely painful for me to walk. Shall we cool down our libidos with a spot of crypt viewing?": "Katie",
  "I have nothing to make me feel good, except for you. The last thing I want to do is turn you into my new drug of choice.": "Collette",
  "Talk to me. Say something, anything,\" he pleaded quietly as if he was trying to tame a wild animal.\"There's nothing to say.\"He looked up and lowered his eyebrows on his eyes. \"Why did you kiss me?": "Stephanie",
  "He gently sucked on my lower lip, biting it carefully with his teeth. It sent tingles all over my body and I had to hold on to his strong shoulders, firm under my fingers. I opened my mouth and tugged once on his lip ring. What happened next was the best sound I had ever heard before. He groaned so deeply that I couldn\u2019t keep my answering moan quiet.": "Stephanie",
  "Take a table and I\u2019ll join you in a second.\u2019\u2019When he walked away I did something I couldn\u2019t be scolded for doing.I checked out his ass in his jeans and\u2026that looked good.": "Stephanie",
  "Why are you looking at me like that?\u2019\u2019 he asked, his hand tensing for a second on my hip.\u201cNo reason.\u2019\u2019 I moved my hand up his chest and on the way his abs contracted.He pushed me away abruptly, forcing me to sit up with him. With the scruff hiding parts of his cheeks I wasn\u2019t sure, but he seemed to be blushing. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t touch a man like that in the morning,\u2019\u2019 he rasped, his hand hiding his crotch.": "Stephanie",
  "If a man can't love you for who you are, he's not worth The Dior Gloss.": "Leah",
  "She couldn't detach from him, couldn't catch her breath, and didn't want to. Not ever again.": "Kristin",
  "You know,\u201d she stammered, resenting the way her body reacted to his touch with fireworks and songbirds, \u201cI kind of hate you sometimes.\u201d\u201cIf that\u2019s code for \u2018I want to fuck you until I can\u2019t walk straight\u2019, then I kind of hate you, too.": "Jennifer",
  "I was falling back again and fast, or maybe I\u2019d never stopped feeling something for him. And it was still hopeless, but at least, I could touch him a little bit.": "Stephanie",
  "I had never had a big opinion for myself. I had always thought I'd be a fuck up, that I'd be disappointed like always by life and people. But at this very moment, I knew it. I wasn't a good man, not well-adjusted. \u2014Nolan": "Stephanie",
  "All I could think about was the heat of his soft lips, the way they fitted so wonderfully as I was coaxing him to open them some more, just enough to let my tongue slip in and taste him. I needed a taste, needed to complete this fantasy of mine.": "Stephanie",
  "Don\u2019t cry,\u2019\u2019 he breathed out so very close to my face. Just a little closer and I\u2019d feel his lips ghosting against mine. \u201cIt\u2019s like a punch in my guts when you cry.\u2019\u2019 \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t touch me,\u2019\u2019 I said, but despite my words, I didn\u2019t try to move away from his touch. A tear ran to my upper lip and I tasted it with the very tip of my tongue. Nolan\u2019s eyes darkened when he followed it, not straying from my mouth. I could see goosebumps over his skin on his neck and on his forearms. \u201cNolan?": "Stephanie",
  "Be myself. If only I remembered what it was like to be myself. I\u2019m a fucking waitress in a crappy bar in a small town in the middle of nowhere. I was going nowhere. I had nothing to give him beside myself and my heart and he denied me.": "Stephanie",
  "She shouldn\u2019t be this close to Cole, not alone, not even when she was pissed beyond belief. It was too dangerous, since she had yet to find a cure for I-hate-you-but-I-want-to-fuck-your-brains-out-itis.": "Jennifer",
  "He brought his forehead against mine and we breathed the same air, slowly to try and find our composure. But it was impossible for me as long as he\u2019s so close to me. \u201cYou\u2019re ruining me.\ufffd": "Stephanie",
  "I said nothing in my texts. You came up with your own conclusions and you were mad thinking about me being with someone else\u2026\u2019\u2019 \u201cStop,\u2019\u2019 he said, his jaw tightening. \u201cTouching another man\u2026\u2019\u2019 \u201cStop it.\u2019\u2019 \u201cSleeping\u2026\u2019\u2019 He ran to me and grabbed my shoulders, shaking me once, not hard, but enough to make me stop. \u201cQuit it,\u2019\u2019 he whispered, his voice deep and dark.": "Stephanie",
  "He\u2019d said he couldn\u2019t let her go. She couldn\u2019t figure out how they could stay together.": "Alexia",
  "When you love someone, you're willing to give up damn near anything for them to be happy.": "Jenna",
  "Though in fairness, before tonight she wouldn't have known exactly how to classify them. Sorta childhood friends through her brother, turned business rivals who had absolutely incendiary chemistry when they let it loose, which was almost never. Yeah, that wasn't unclear at all... Sarcasm. Kady's second-favorite \u2014asm.": "Laura",
  "I closed my eyes and immediately I pictured Brooklyn\u2019s full lips parted on a moan, her eyes glassy and her pupils dilated, her cheeks flushed and her body\u2026her smoking body bared only for me.": "Stephanie",
  "A year ago, you fell into my arms and I felt some crazy connection to you. I'm sure as hell not good enough for you, and I'm sure as hell not making any promises, but I'm damn sure you were worth waiting for.": "Victoria",
  "It was one thing to jack off. It was another thing to jack off and not secure your shit before you opened a goddamned door. That was like, Puberty 101. Or Being a Guy 101. Or Basic Fucking Common Sense 101.": "Laura",
  "If only it felt like an academic exercise when she kissed him, instead of a soul-drowning tsunami of want and need.": "Alexia",
  "For God\u2019s sake, Helen, I stood in front of my peers and basically said, \u2018Look, chaps, I can\u2019t vote because all I can think about is kissing that brilliant woman who was just in here.\u2019 And I don\u2019t even bloody know if you still want me to kiss you.": "Alexia",
  "Is that the way you live your life, logic over emotion?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the way I run my business. Up to now, there hasn\u2019t been any overlap.": "Alexia",
  "Quietly, under my breath, I mumbled a name and it wasn\u2019t the name of the girl waiting in the other room. In my mind I pictured Brooklyn\u2019s sounds as she came and I jerked in my hand, coming and coming. Something had to give.": "Stephanie",
  "Seeing you with that guy tonight made me nuts, because every bone in my body says you\u2019re mine.": "J.M.",
  "Just give me more, better memories to replace the bad ones. I\u2019ll be back to normal before we know it.": "A.R.",
  "I felt a pull toward her even before I actually spotted her in her car and I\u2019m glad I didn\u2019t resist.": "A.R.",
  "You are so going down for that.\" He grabbed the keys and headed back to the road. \"When you least expect it,\" he added over his shoulder.\"I'm shaking in my shoes,\" she called out.\"You're not wearing any.\"\"Exactly.\"Damn, he liked this girl.": "Robin",
  "Charlie brought her dandelion to her mouth. \"I've heard that, too. But this happens to be something I've done a lot and it's easy. Just take a deep breath, put your lips together, and blow.\" She closed her eyes and blew. When she lifted her lids, she found him watching her.Or rather, watching her mouth. She let go of the flower stem and swallowed. \"I'm thinking those lips of yours could make any man's wish come true.": "Robin",
  "I feel your pain. My vibrator needed batteries.": "Wendy",
  "For what it\u2019s worth\u201d\u2014he rose from his seat, moved around the table and bent over her, whispering in her ear as he pressed a kiss to her cheek\u2014 \u201cI like you better in a pair of worn jeans, and I think you deserve someone who appreciates what he\u2019s got. Not someone out to have a good time.": "J.M.",
  "Maybe I am the eye candy on the team, but the only mouth I plan on melting in is hers.": "Collette",
  "Don\u2019t take the bait if she asks you if you like sex toys.": "Wendy",
  "His calm and gentle tone was like an anchor in a ferocious sea, keeping me from drifting into a current of heartache.": "K.M.",
  "Oh, crap.The last person she wanted to run into this morning when she had to be super-professional was Hot Pool Guy. Before she had a chance to hide behind a plant or something, his gaze connected with hers and held her hostage.He flashed a smile and headed her way. Shit. She got to her feet thinking she'd say a quick hello before telling him she was meeting someone and excuse herself. Look away from those amazing dark eyes before you get yourself in trouble. She forced her attention down.And found a logo on the breast pocket of his white polo shirt.Word.Heritage.Fund.Kill her now.": "Robin",
  "Charlie had kissed a lot of guys. And Connor's kiss had been the best ever. Ever, ever, ever.": "Robin",
  "And here I thought the orgasm came with the coffee.": "Wendy",
  "He parked the car, pressed the button for the roof to fold back, and undid his seat belt. \"It's an emergency.\"Goldilocks giggled. She unfastened her belt and hopped onto her knees. \"Yes, I can see\" - she glanced down at his crotch - \"That we're in danger of a detonation. What's the protocol in a situation like this, Mr. Environmentalist?\"\"I'm afraid I have no choice but to advocate for release.": "Robin",
  "In third period Math, we were forced to sit in alphabetical order. Which put me right behind Logan, who was throwing all those passes to Aiden in the scrimmage. He took off his navy blazer and when he leaned forward to write, I could see muscles bulging across his back and shoulders. I can already tell Math is going to suck, but at least I\u2019ll have a nice view.It\u2019s like what Grandpa always says about real estate. Location, location, location.": "Jillian",
  "The only time I get to be alone is while traveling.\"\"Except this week,\" Charlie said.He turned his head and she saw herself reflected in his shades. \"True. And you're not at all what I expected.\"Not that Connor had had any idea what to expect. But he would've preferred if she hadn't been the beautiful blonde who wore skimpy red bikini tops and starred in his dreams last night.": "Robin",
  "He smiles.\u00a0It\u2019s a blinding, white-toothed smile.\u00a0A push-me-over-the-edge-of-the-love-cliff smile.\u00a0And before I can say a word in protest, he\u2019s got my hand and is dragging me through the carnival.Note to self: Do not stare directly at his smile. It holds special powers.Also: Do not kiss him. His mouth is definitely the source of his power.": "Jillian",
  "I've always had this fantasy of being at the top of a Ferris wheel with a gorgeous guy and having him kiss me.\"\"Really? That's your fantasy?\"\"One of them.\" She narrowed her eyes, but it didn't diminish their light.\"And I fit the bill?\" he said, unable to stop himself from moving his stare to her mouth. Christ, he wasn't expecting her to say any of that, but now that she had, he had the urge to fulfill all her fantasies.\"You asked.\" She shrugged and started to turn away.He caught her jaw and tilted it up to his. \"Do you want me to kiss you?\"Long, dark eyelashes reached the arch of her brows. \"We shouldn't\"\"That's not what I asked.\"She squirmed, her breath caught.\"Yes,\" she whispered.": "Robin",
  "First one of you to call me Yoko,\u201d Todd warned as he stepped up, \u201cis a dead man.": "Ophelia",
  "Her arms slid around my back and I heard the softest moan in my ear as she snuggled into my chest. Her mouth pressed to my neck, not kissing, just\u2026there. On me.Dammity-damn-damn-damn.": "Ophelia",
  "They say the eyes are the windows to our soul; glass gateways that do little to conceal our true self. Yet, for me, they're also the narrators of our heart and give insight to our well-kept secrets... secrets I wanted to remain hidden.": "K.M.",
  "It was her turn to hold him up.": "J.M.",
  "Charlie swallowed. He was gloriously sexy. The hottest man she'd ever seen with his sculpted chest and abs., narrow waist, long muscular legs dusted with dark brown hair. Her gaze roamed over every inch of him before settling on his erection. It was big, thick, and hard for her. Her mouth watered in anticipation.": "Robin",
  "With a gentle touch, she brushed the hair off his forehead. \"I was sort of hoping you'd be a little more relaxed today.\"He took her hand and kissed it.\"I'm very relaxed.\"\"Finally?\" She raised her eyebrows and snuggled closer.\"You feel a little stiff.\"And getting stiffer by the second. He had zero control around this woman. \"We should probably do something about that.": "Robin",
  "The man was potent to her system, her very own drug.": "J.M.",
  "Feel free to check out the hotel and talk to the staff,\" he said slipping out of bed. \"And I'm happy to give you an up-close look at what we're doing.\" When she didn't answer, he glanced over his shoulder. Then cleared his throat.Her attention jumped from his ass to his face. \"Sorry, what did you say/\"\"I said---\"She sat up, letting the sheet fall to her waist. And damn if she wasn't the most gorgeous thing with her creamy skin, pert breasts, and mussed hair.He moaned like a guy totally whipped and stalked back to the bed where he climbed on top of her.\"Connor.\" She giggled and wiggled beneath him. Her arms went around his neck. \"What are you doing?\"\"Forgetting the time.\" He kissed her and didn't leave until they'd both had their fill.": "Robin",
  "Connor couldn't be sure, but he thought he heard him mumble, \"First Dean, then McCall. These boys are dropping like flies.": "Robin",
  "Hope is a very strange thing, Constance Thyme, and something I haven\u2019t had much of, as late. Yet all the signs lead me to believe there may be some left in the world for me, after all.": "Antoinette",
  "I completely lost control. I was out of my fucking mind with the taste of her, the feel of her, those little moans of pleasure she made. Fuck, that woman completely unmans me. She consumes me to the point where my brain stops functioning entirely\u2026.": "Franca",
  "You\u2019re virtually unknown over in the States. This could be the thing that helps you crack America. I can just see it now, a picture of you reclining in a pair of tighty whiteys advertising for Calvin Klein on the side of a skyscraper.\u201d\u201cFuck, man. Are you a psychic? How did you know that\u2019s my one true dream?": "L.H.",
  "Sometimes you have to walk away from what you want in order to find what you deserve.": "Belle",
  "We are together. That means I don\u2019t look at another woman the way I look at you. I don\u2019t touch another woman the way I touch you. I don\u2019t feel about any woman the way I feel about you. Got it? Don\u2019t ever think I\u2019d throw away what we have for a cheap, meaningless fuck. You either trust me, or you don\u2019t. So what\u2019s it going to be? -Ronin Black": "Lorelei",
  "When I\u2019m away from you I am lost.But when I\u2019m with you, I am lost in you.": "Eliza"
