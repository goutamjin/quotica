  "There are times when every act, no matter how private or unconscious, becomes political. Whom you live with, how you wear your hair, whether you marry, whether you insist that your child take piano lessons, what are the brand names on your shelf; all these become political decisions. At other times, no act--no campaign or tract, statement or rampage--has any political charge at all. People with the least sense of which times are, and which are not, political are usually most avid about politics.

Sometimes it's the curve of a wrist or what's left of romance, still hiding in the drawer of some long lost nightstand or carefully drawn in the margins of an old discarded calendar. Sometimes it's even just a vapor trail speeding west, prophetic, over clouds aglow with dangerous light. Of course these are only images, my images, and in the end they're born out of something much more akin to a Voice, which though invisible to the eye and frequently unheard by even the ear still continues, day and night, year after year, to sweep through us all.": "Mark",

The trees group themselves differently; they draw closer together, as if in fear. The very silence has another quality than the silence of the day. And it is full of half-heard whispers, whispers that startle - ghosts of sounds long dead. There are living sounds, too, such as are never heard under other conditions: notes of strange night birds, the cries of small animals in sudden encounters with stealthy foes, or in their dreams, a rustling in the dead leaves - it may be the leap of a wood rat, it may be the footstep of a panther. What caused the breaking of that twig? What the low, alarmed twittering in that bushful of birds? There are sounds without a name, forms without substance, translations in space of objects which have not been seen to move, movements wherein nothing is observed to change its place.

  "But it wasn\u2019t mine anymore. It was his. I was his. Something in that flirted with the submissive I knew that lurked inside. How long had I waited and searched for the right man?

  "This book consists not only of my stories of mistakes, rather it\u2019s all our stories of mistakes and heart aches. It\u2019s the plight of all of us who were rebelling, and kicking against the social messes we found ourselves in. Yet there are so many others who are not alive today, and I feel obligated in not allowing the lessons of their mistakes to lie in the grave with them. It was the United States Senator, Al Franken, who stated, \u201cMistakes are a part of being human. Precious life lessons that can only be learned the hard way unless it's a fatal mistake, which, at least, others can learn from.\u201d I\u2019m revealing all of those mistakes and more, sadly a lot of them are fatal. In an attempt to have these real life lessons obtained in blood, prevent the blood-shedding of so many others. These stories are ones that young people can understand and identify with. While at the same time empowering them, to make better decisions about their choice of friends, the proper use of their time and how one wrong move can be fatal. I guess the major question that we all have to ask ourselves at the end of the day would be: how could I and so many others have been prevented from becoming monsters? You be the judge. I now extend my hand to you, and personally invite you to take a journey with me into the heartlands of innocence to menacing, from a youngster to a monster, and the making of a predator. I will safely walk you down the deserted and darkened street corners which were once my world of crime, gang violence and senseless murders. It\u2019s a different world unto itself, one which could only be observed up close by invitation only. Together we will learn the motivation behind hard-core gangsters, and explore the minds of cold-blooded murderers. You will discover the way they think about their own lives, and why they are so remorseless about the taking of another\u2019s life. So, if you will, please journey with me as we discover together how the fight of our lives were wrapped up in our fathers.": "Drexel",

  "Oh, we can populate the dark with horrors, even we who think ourselves informed and sure, believing nothing we cannot measure or weigh. I knew beyond all doubt that the dark things crowding in on me either did not exist or were not dangerous to me, and still I was afraid. I thought how terrible the nights must have been in a time when men knew the things were there and were deadly. But no, that's wrong. If I knew they were there, I would have weapons against them, charms, prayers, some kind of alliance with forces equally strong but on my side. Knowing they were not there made me defenseless against them and perhaps more afraid.": "John",

  "Under the glass porte-coch\u00e8re of a theatre Amory stood, watching the first great drops of rain splatter down and flatten to dark stains on the sidewalk. The air became grey and opalescent; a solitary light suddenly outlined a window over the way; then another light; then a hundred more danced and glimmered into vision. Under his feet a thick, iron-studded skylight turned yellow; in the street the lamps of the taxicabs sent out glistening sheens along the already black pavement.

The cleaned scent of the meat and the clatter of the water in the skink, the branches of rosemary, the dogs finding each other\u2019s ears in the evening, the children being called indoors, servants standing on the road for the Indian bus, and the rising heat of the oven against the remaining heat of the day made her aware of her own happiness.

And when some man denied the efficacy of baptism, or may be said, 'I do not believe that a fish ever swallowed a man to keep him from drowning,' then they put his thumb between these pieces of iron and in the name of love and universal forgiveness, began to screw these pieces together.

  "Close your eyes and stare into the dark. My father's advice when I couldn't sleep as a little girl. He wouldn't want me to do that now but I've set my mind to the task regardless. I'm staring beyond my closed eyelids. Though I lie still on the ground, I feel perched at the highest point I could possibly be; clutching at a star in the night sky with my legs dangling above cold black nothingness. I take one last look at my fingers wrapped around the light and let go. Down I go, falling, then floating, and, falling again, I wait for the land of my life. I know now, as I knew as that little girl fighting sleep, that behind her gauzed screen of shut-eye, lies colour. It taunts me, dares me to open my eyes and lose sleep. Flashes of red and amber, yellow and white speckle my darkness. I refuse to open them. I rebel and I squeeze my eyelids together tighter to block out the grains of light, mere distractions that keep us awake but a sign that there's life beyond.But there's no life in me. None that I can feel, from where I lie at the bottom of the staircase. My heart beats quicker now, the lone fighter left standing in the ring, a red boxing glove pumping victoriously into the air, refusing to give up. It's the only part of me that cares, the only part that ever cared. It fights to pump the blood around to heal, to replace what I'm losing. But it's all leaving my body as quickly as it's sent; forming a deep black ocean of its own around me where I've fallen.Rushing, rushing, rushing. We are always rushing. Never have enough time here, always trying to make our way there. Need to have left here five minutes ago, need to be there now. The phone rings again and I acknowledge the irony. I could have taken my time and answered it now. Now, not then. I could have taken all the time in the world on each of those steps. But we're always rushing. All, but my heart. That slows now. I don't mind so much. I place my hand on my belly. If my child is gone, and I suspect this is so, I'll join it there. There.....where? Wherever. It; a heartless word. He or she so young; who it was to become, still a question. But there, I will mother it. There, not here. I'll tell it; I'm sorry, sweetheart, I'm sorry I ruined your chances - our chances of a life together.But close your eyes and stare into the darkness now, like Mummy is doing, and we'll find our way together. There's a noise in the room and I feel a presence. 'Oh God, Joyce, oh God. Can you hear me, love? Oh God. Oh God, please no, Hold on love, I'm here. Dad is here.'I don't want to hold on and I feel like telling him so. I hear myself groan, an animal-like whimper and it shocks me, scares me. I have a plan, I want to tell him. I want to go, only then can I be with my baby. Then, not now. He's stopped me from falling but I haven't landed yet. Instead he helps me balance on nothing, hover while I'm forced to make the decision. I want to keep falling but he's calling the ambulance and he's gripping my hand with such ferocity it's as though I'm all he has. He's brushing the hair from my forehead and weeping loudly. I've never heard him weep. Not even when Mum died. He clings to my hand with all of his strength I never knew his old body had and I remember that I am all he has and that he, once again just like before, is my whole world. The blood continues to rush through me. Rushing, rushing, rushing. We are always rushing. Maybe I'm rushing again. Maybe it's not my time to go. I feel the rough skin of old hands squeezing mine, and their intensity and their familiarity force me to open my eyes. Lights fills them and I glimpse his face, a look I never want to see again. He clings to his baby. I know I lost mind; I can't let him lose his. In making my decision I already begin to grieve. I've landed now, the land of my life. And still my heart pumps on. Even when broken it still works.": "Cecelia",

While you stand there in the hall, with the envelope in your hand, you feel there's an eye on you, a great big eye looking straight at you from miles and dark and through walls and houses and through your coat and vest and hide and sees you huddled up way inside, in the dark which is you, inside yourself, like a clammy, sad little fetus you carry around inside yourself. The eye knows what's in the envelope, and it is watching you to see you when you open it and know, too. But the clammy, sad little fetus which is you way down in the dark which is you too lifts up its sad little face and its eyes are blind, and it shivers cold inside you for it doesn't want to know what is in that envelope.

  "There was nothing the matter out there. It was in here, with me.I decided I'd better go to work, maybe that would exorcise me. I fled from the room almost as though it were haunted. It was too late to stop off at a breakfast counter now. I didn't want any, anyway. My stomach kept giving little quivers. In the end I didn't go to work, either. I couldn't, I wouldn't have been any good.

Wherever the sunshine was the brightest, I sought and stayed in that place, and when it moved on I moved with it. I couldn't get it bright enough or strong enough. I avoided the shade, I edged away from it, even the slight shade of an awning or of a tree.And yet the sunshine didn't warm me. Where others mopped their brows and moved out of it, I stayed - and remained cold inside. And the shade was winning the battle as the hours lengthened. It outlasted the sun.

  "As Sandy and his wife warmed to the tale, one tripping up another in their eagerness to tell everything, it gradually developed as distinct a superstition as I ever heard, and not without poetry and pathos. How long it was since the voice had been heard first, nobody could tell with certainty. Jarvis's opinion was that his father, who had been coachman at Brentwood before him, had never heard anything about it, and that the whole thing had arisen within the last ten years, since the complete dismantling of the old house: which was a wonderfully modern date for a tale so well authenticated. According to these witnesses, and to several whom I questioned afterwards, and who were all in perfect agreement, it was only in the months of November and December that \"the visitation\" occurred. During these months, the darkest of the year, scarcely a night passed without the recurrence of these inexplicable cries.

  "..I began speaking.. First, I took issue with the media's characterization of the post-Katrina New Orleans as resembling the third world as its poor citizens clamored for a way out. I suggested that my experience in New Orleans working with the city's poorest people in the years before the storm had reflected the reality of third-world conditions in New Orleans, and that Katrina had not turned New Orleans into a third-world city but had only revealed it to the world as such. I explained that my work, running Reprieve, a charity that brought lawyers and volunteers to the Deep South from abroad to work on death penalty issues, had made it clear to me that much of the world had perceived this third-world reality, even if it was unnoticed by our own citizens.  To try answer Ryan's question, I attempted to use my own experience to explain that for many people in New Orleans, and in poor communities across the country, the government was merely an antagonist, a terrible landlord, a jailer, and a prosecutor. As a lawyer assigned to indigent people under sentence of death and paid with tax dollars, I explained the difficulty of working with clients who stand to be executed and who are provided my services by the state, not because they deserve them, but because the Constitution requires that certain appeals to be filed before these people can be killed. The state is providing my clients with my assistance, maybe the first real assistance they have ever received from the state, so that the state can kill them.  I explained my view that the country had grown complacent before Hurricane Katrina, believing that the civil rights struggle had been fought and won, as though having a national holiday for Martin Luther King, or an annual march by politicians over the bridge in Selma, Alabama, or a prosecution - forty years too late - of Edgar Ray Killen for the murder of civil rights workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi, were any more than gestures. Even though President Bush celebrates his birthday, wouldn't Dr. King cry if he could see how little things have changed since his death? If politicians or journalists went to Selma any other day of the year, they would see that it is a crumbling city suffering from all of the woes of the era before civil rights were won as well as new woes that have come about since. And does anyone really think that the Mississippi criminal justice system could possibly be a vessel of social change when it incarcerates a greater percentage of its population than almost any place in the world, other than Louisiana and Texas, and then compels these prisoners, most of whom are black, to work prison farms that their ancestors worked as chattel of other men? ...I hoped, out loud, that the post-Katrina experience could be a similar moment [to the Triangle Shirtwaist factory fiasco], in which the American people could act like the children in the story and declare that the emperor has no clothes, and hasn't for a long time. That, in light of Katrina, we could be visionary and bold about what people deserve. We could say straight out that there are people in this country who are racist, that minorities are still not getting a fair shake, and that Republican policies heartlessly disregard the needs of individual citizens and betray the common good. As I stood there, exhausted, in front of the thinning audience of New Yorkers, it seemed possible that New Orleans's destruction and the suffering of its citizens hadn't been in vain.": "Billy",
  "What I did not know yet about hunger, but would find out over the next twenty-one years, was that brilliant theorists of economics do not find it worthwhile to spend time discussing issues of poverty and hunger.

  "Would it not be better if they spent more money on wholesome things like oranges and wholemeal bread or if they even, like the writer of the letter to the New Statesman, saved on fuel and ate their carrots raw? Yes, it would, but the point is that no ordinary human being is ever going to do such a thing. The ordinary human being would sooner starve than live on brown bread and raw carrots. And the peculiar evil is this, that the less money you have, the less inclined you feel to spend it on wholesome food. A millionaire may enjoy breakfasting off orange juice and Ryvita biscuits; an unemployed man doesn't. Here the tendency of which I spoke at the end of the last chapter comes into play. When you are unemployed, which is to say when you are underfed, harassed, bored, and miserable, you don't want to eat dull wholesome food. You want something a little bit 'tasty'.

  "The train bore me away, through the monstrous scenery of slag-heaps, chimneys, piled scrap-iron, foul canals, paths of cindery mud criss-crossed by the prints of clogs. This was March, but the weather had been horribly cold and everywhere there were mounds of blackened snow. As we moved slowly through the outskirts of the town we passed row after row of little grey slum houses running at right angles to the embankment. At the back of one of the houses a young woman was kneeling on the stones, poking a stick up the leaden waste-pipe which ran from the sink inside and which I suppose was blocked. I had time to see everything about her\u2014her sacking apron, her clumsy clogs, her arms reddened by the cold. She looked up as the train passed, and I was almost near enough to catch her eye. She had a round pale face, the usual exhausted face of the slum girl who is twenty-five and looks forty, thanks to miscarriages and drudgery; and it wore, for the second in which I saw it, the most desolate, hopeless expression I have ever-seen. It struck me then that we are mistaken when we say that \u2018It isn\u2019t the same for them as it would be for us,\u2019 and that people bred in the slums can imagine nothing but the slums. For what I saw in her face was not the ignorant suffering of an animal.

  "We have the money. We\u2019ve just made choices about how to spend it. Over the years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have restricted housing aid to the poor but expanded it to the affluent in the form of tax benefits for homeowners. 57 Today, housing-related tax expenditures far outpace those for housing assistance. In 2008, the year Arleen was evicted from Thirteenth Street, federal expenditures for direct housing assistance totaled less than $40.2 billion, but homeowner tax benefits exceeded $171 billion. That number, $171 billion, was equivalent to the 2008 budgets for the Department of Education, the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Agriculture combined. 58 Each year, we spend three times what a universal housing voucher program is estimated to cost (in total ) on homeowner benefits, like the mortgage-interest deduction and the capital-gains exclusion. Most federal housing subsidies benefit families with six-figure incomes. 59 If we are going to spend the bulk of our public dollars on the affluent\u2014at least when it comes to housing\u2014we should own up to that decision and stop repeating the politicians\u2019 canard about one of the richest countries on the planet being unable to afford doing more.

But not all of those extra dollars will stay in the pockets of the poor. Wage hikes are tempered if rents rise along with them, just as food stamps are worth less if groceries in the inner city cost more\u2014and they do, as much as 40 percent more, by one estimate. 43 Poverty is two-faced\u2014a matter of income and expenses, input and output\u2014and in a world of exploitation, it will not be effectively ameliorated if we ignore this plain fact.": "Matthew",

  "In white neighborhoods, only 1 in 41 properties that could have received a nuisance citation actually did receive one. In black neighborhoods, 1 in 16 eligible properties received a citation. A woman reporting domestic violence was far more likely to land her landlord a nuisance citation if she lived in the inner city.In the vast majority of cases (83 percent), landlords who received a nuisance citation for domestic violence responded by either evicting the tenants or by threatening to evict them for future police calls. Sometimes, this meant evicting a couple, but most of the time landlords evicted women abused by men who did not live with them.": "Matthew",
  "When tenants relinquished protections by falling behind in rent or otherwise breaking their rental agreement, landlords could respond\u00a0by neglecting repairs.

One-third experienced clogged plumbing that lasted more than a day. And 1 in 10 spent at least a day without heat. African American households were the most likely to have these problems\u2014as were those where children slept.

The house and the yard were littered with trash. \u201cDisgusting,\u201d Tim said to the roaches scaling the kitchen wall. As the landlord changed the locks with a power drill and the movers pushed the contents of the house onto the wet curb, the children began to run around and laugh. When the move was done, the crew gathered by the trucks, instinctively stomping the ground to shake loose any stowaway roaches. Those who smoked reached for their packs.

But large-scale social transformations\u2014the crack epidemic, the rise of the black middle class, and the prison boom among them\u2014had frayed the family safety net in poor communities.

During the early twentieth century, tenants organized against evictions and unsanitary conditions. When landlords raised rents too often or too steeply, tenants went so far as to stage rent strikes. Strikers joined together to withhold rent and form picket lines, risking eviction, arrest, and beatings by hired thugs. They were not an especially radical bunch, these strikers. Most were ordinary mothers and fathers who believed landlords were entitled to modest rent increases and fair profits, but not \u201cprice gouging.\u201d In New York City, the great rent wars of the Roaring Twenties forced a state legislature to impose rent controls that remain the country\u2019s strongest to this day.Petitions, picket lines, civil disobedience\u2014this kind of political mobilization required a certain shift in vision.": "Matthew",

  "It was an old tradition: landlords barring children from their properties.

And these people have the audacity to call their position pro-life.These same people who bemoan the welfare state, yet refuse to require business to honor a fair wage, appear to want to create the very circumstances that they ceaselessly complain about. I dare say that by perpetuating this condition, by feeding the apparatus of poverty, they are satiating their narcissism.With poverty securely entrenched, these lucky few can sit back and smile with smug superiority. Because of course, they pulled themselves up by their bootstraps, they worked harder, and they have earned what they have. It's a meritocracy, they say, if only by merit of their parent's color of flesh or social standing.So yes, let's churn out more children who will be unable to claw their way out of poverty, and if they just happen to defy the odds, let's brainwash them into believing this tripe called the American Dream so they will assist us as we throw their less fortunate fortunate siblings into the hungry machine of conservatism.

These goods consists of machines, tools, computers, buildings, semi-manufactured goods, software, etc., and they exist due to prior savings of the nation's citizens.

Heaven has not made them to become civilized; it is necessary that they die. Besides I do not want to get mixed up in it. I will not do anything against them: I will limit myself to providing everything that will hasten their ruin. In time I will have their lands and will be innocent of their death.

  "Racism is both overt and covert. It takes two, closely related forms: individual whites acting against individual blacks, and acts by the total white community against the black community. We call these individual racism and institutional racism. The first consists of overt acts by individuals, which cause death, injury or the violent destruction of property. This type can be recorded by television cameras; it can frequently be observed in the process of commission. The second type is less overt, far more subtle, less identifiable in terms of specific individuals committing the acts. But it is no less destructive of human life. The second type originates in the operation of established and respected forces in the society, and thus receives far less public condemnation than the first type. When white terrorists bomb a black church and kill five black children, that is an act of individual racism, widely deplored by most segments of the society. But when in that same city - Birmingham, Alabama - five hundred black babies die each year because of the lack of proper food, shelter and medical facilities, and thousands more are destroyed and maimed physically, emotionally and intellectually because of conditions of poverty and discrimination in the black community, that is a function of institutional racism. When a black family moves into a home in a white neighborhood and is stoned, burned or routed out, they are victims of an overt act of individual racism which many people will condemn - at least in words. But it is institutional racism that keeps black people locked in dilapidated slum tenements, subject to the daily prey of exploitative slumlords, merchants, loan sharks and discriminatory real estate agents.

Both my parents grew up with a deep sense of poverty that was mostly emotional but that they imagined as material long after they clambered into the middle class, and so they were more like a pair of rivalrous older siblings than parents who see their children as extensions of themselves and their hopes. They were stuck in separateness.I didn't realize anything was odd until I was already on my own and found out that not everyone's parents cut them off financially as soon as the law allowed. I tried to leave home unsuccessfully at fourteen and fifteen and sixteen and did so successfully at seventeen, heading off to another country, as far away as I could go, and once I got there I realized I was more on my own than I had anticipated: I was henceforth entirely repsonsible for myself and thus began a few years of poverty.": "Rebecca",

An inner voice calls to the shaman and an essayistic writer to answer the call that vexes the pernicious spirit of their times. Shamanistic writers induce a trance state of mind where they lose contact with physical reality through a rational disordering of the senses, in an effort to encounter for the umpteenth time the great unknown and the unutterable truths that structure existence. An afflicted person seeking clarification of existence cannot ignore the shamanistic calling of narrative exposition.

  "HOW TO DRIVE A WRITER CRAZY\u201c1. When he starts to outline a story, immediately give him several stories just like it to read and tell him three other plots. This makes his own story and his feeling for it vanish in a cloud of disrelated facts.\"2. When he outlines a character, read excerpts from stories about such characters, saying that this will clarify the writer's ideas. As this causes him to lose touch with the identity he felt in his character by robbing him of individuality, he is certain to back away from ever touching such a character.\"3. Whenever the writer proposes a story, always mention that his rate, being higher than other rates of writers in the book, puts up a bar to his stories.\"4. When a rumor has stated that a writer is a fast producer, invariably confront him with the fact with great disapproval, as it is, of course, unnatural for one human being to think faster than another.\"5. Always correlate production and rate, saying that it is necessary for the writer to do better stories than the average for him to get any consideration whatever.\"6. It is a good thing to mention any error in a story bought, especially when that error is to be editorially corrected, as this makes the writer feel that he is being criticized behind his back and he wonders just how many other things are wrong.\"7. Never fail to warn a writer not to be mechanical, as this automatically suggests to him that his stories are mechanical and, as he considers this a crime, wonders how much of his technique shows through and instantly goes to much trouble to bury mechanics very deep\u2014which will result in laying the mechanics bare to the eye.\"8. Never fail to mention and then discuss budget problems with a writer, as he is very interested.\"9. By showing his vast knowledge of a field, an editor can almost always frighten a writer into mental paralysis, especially on subjects where nothing is known anyway.\"10. Always tell a writer plot tricks, as they are not his business.": "L.",

  "Every book adds a grain of humility and humanity to the communal ground that we tread. Writing is the one method that the modern shaman employs to interpret reality and create messages that will provide a beacon of light to other members of our tribe. So long as ignorance, misery, and confusion remain on earth, and people look to expand their state of awareness, books that contribute to the aesthetics of despair, a world composed of mist and shadows cannot be useless. Writing is a personal effort to coexist with the banality, tedium, and anguish of living a fated life. Writing is a shamanistic act of faith because seeking to link thoughts together in order to understand how one fits into nature\u2019s wonderland is a quest for unity and wholeness, the ultimate medicinal poultices that all self-disciplined shaman and alchemistic writers aspire to achieve.": "Kilroy",

It was really then that I was able to understand that I wasn\u2019t my past. Nobody is. One thing I have always loved about writing is how it can transform you and allow you to reinvent yourself.

With a little brain storming ideas written on cards, as well as designs and plans on the table, one can even write a novel in a month.

Whereas in America, and in England, a good writer is the watch-dog of society. His job is to satirize its silliness, to attack its injustices, to stigmatize its faults.

  "We write because the blank piece of paper and the pen are there. We write because this is our addiction and we are proud of it. Our habit, our drug, our crutch. Whatever you wish to call it. We write because since an early age we felt it deep in our souls and in our bones. The poem must be written, the story must be told and the new myths and Gods are waiting for you to bring them forth from out of the darkness and to bring them into the light of being. You are a creator, so create. You are the writer. So write.": "R.M.",

  "The final advantage is the same that applies in every other competitive venture. If you would like to write better than everyone else, you have to want to write better than everyone else. You must take an obsessive pride in the smallest details of your craft. And you must be willing to defend what you've written against the various middlemen--editors, agents, and publishers--whose sights may be different from yours, whose standards are not as high. Too many writers are browbeaten into settling for less than their best.": "William",
  "The Christian writer will feel that in the greatest depth of vision, moral judgment will be implicit, and that when we are invited to represent the country according to survey, what we are asked to do is to separate mystery from manners and judgment from vision, in order to produce something a little more palatable to the modern temper. We are asked to form our consciences in the light of statistics, which is to establish the relative as absolute. For many this may be a convenience, since we don't live in an age of settled belief; but it cannot be a convenience, it cannot even be possible, for the writer who is a Catholic. He will feel that any long-continued service to it will produce a soggy, formless, and sentimental literature, one that will provide a sense of spiritual purpose for those who connect the spirit with romanticism and a sense of joy for those who confuse that virtue with satisfaction. The storyteller is concerned with what is; but if what is is what can be determined by survey, then the disciples of Dr. Kinsey and Dr. Gallup are sufficient for the day thereof.": "Flannery",
  "There is a great tendency today to want everybody to write just the way everybody else does, to see and to show the same things in the same way to the same middling audience. But the writer, in order best to use the talents he has been given, has to write at his own intellectual level. For him to do anything else is to bury his talents. This doesn't mean that, within his limitations, he shouldn't try to reach as many people as possible, but it does mean that he must not lower his standards to do so.": "Flannery",

Too many writers and a cast of dead poets found themselves dangerously adrift on the flowing river of black ink interlocked in a life and death struggle with the creative streams of impulsion colliding with the rocky pods of madness.

His kind of fiction will always be pushing its own limits outward toward the limits of mystery, because for this kind of writer, the meaning of a story does not begin except at a depth where adequate motivation and adequate psychology and the various determinations have been exhausted. Such a writer will be interested in what we don't understand rather than in what we do. He will be interested in possibility rather than probability.

Meaning that I was a complex creature and so was he; that he became even more complex in his attempt to bridge the gap between our complexities; that he could create a complicated image to house this complex of complications.

  "I turn sentences around. That\u2019s my life. I write a sentence and then I turn it around. Then I look at it and I turn it around again. Then I have lunch. Then I come back in and write another sentence. Then I have tea and turn the new sentence around. Then I read the two sentences over and turn them both around. Then I lie down on my sofa and think. Then I get up and throw them out and start from the beginning. And if I knock off from this routine for as long as a day, I\u2019m frantic with boredom and a sense of waste. Sundays I have breakfast late and read the papers with Hope. Then we go for a walk in the hills, and I'm haunted by the loss of all that good time. I wake up Sunday mornings and I'm nearly crazy at the prospect of all those unusable hours. I'm restless, I'm bad-tempered, but she's a human being too, you see, so I go. To avoid trouble she makes me leave my watch at home. The result is that I look at my wrist instead.

The expedition was a joint effort supported by about two hundred galaxies. Boyle wasn't a technician. He was an English teacher. The thing was that Earth was the only place in the whole known Universe where language was used. It was a unique Earthling invention. Everybody else used mental telepathy, so Earthlings could get pretty good jobs as language teachers just about anywhere they went. The reason creatures wanted to use language instead of mental telepathy was that they found out they could get so much more done with language. Language made them so much more active. Mental telepathy, with everybody constantly telling everybody everything, produced a sort of generalized indifference to all information.

I am concerned about the quality of work, not the quantity of books that I release. One can publish hundreds of books within a couple of years today as technology is advance and cheap, but keeping the quality of the work is something you cannot depend of technology and money.

Not a single idea has ever been discovered by means of this brutal method-- and still the trepanning of authors goes on every day.I now refuse all those who wish to take the top off my skull yet again.

  "Bookish folk aren\u2019t what they used to be. Introverted, reserved, studious. There was a time when bookish folk would steer clear of trendy bars, dinner occasions and gatherings. Any social or public encounters would be avoided at all costs because these activities were very un-bookish. Bookish people preferred to stay in, or to sit alone in a quiet pub, reading a good book, or getting some writing done. Writers, in fact, perhaps epitomised these bookish traits most strongly. At least, they used to.These days, bookish people, such as writers, are commonly found on stage, headlining festivals, or being interviewed on TV. Author events and performances have proliferated, becoming established parts of a writer\u2019s role. It\u2019s not that authors have suddenly become more extroverted \u2013 it\u2019s more a case that their job description has changed. Of course, not all writers are bookish.

She even gets the title wrong: she's confusing 'chrysalis' and 'cocoon'. You could pick it apart completely if you wanted to. But the story itself has real power: it draws you in. the overall plots is a fantasy, but the descriptive details is incredibly real.The balance between the two is excellent. I don't know if words like 'originality' or Inevitability' fit here, and I suppose I might agree if someone insisted it's not at that level, but finally, after you work your way through the thing, with all its faults, it leaves a real impression- it gets to you in some strange, inexplicable way that may be a little disturbing.": "Haruki",

  "Asking a writer why they like to write {in the theoretical sense of the question} is like asking a person why they breathe. For me, writing is a natural reflex to the beauty, the events, and the people I see around me. As Anais Nin put it, \"We write to taste life twice.\" I live and then I write. The one transfers to the other, for me, in a gentle, necessary way. As prosaic as it sounds, I believe I process by writing. Part of the way I deal with stressful situations, catty people, or great joy or great trials in my own life is by conjuring it onto paper in some way; a journal entry, a blog post, my writing notebook, or my latest story. While I am a fair conversationalist, my real forte is expressing myself in words on paper. If I leave it all chasing round my head like rabbits in a warren, I'm apt to become a bug-bear to live with and my family would not thank me. Some people need counselors. Some people need long, drawn-out phone-calls with a trusted friend. Some people need to go out for a run. I need to get away to a quiet, lonesome corner--preferably on the front steps at gloaming with the North Star trembling against the darkening blue. I need to set my pen fiercely against the page {for at such moments I must be writing--not typing.} and I need to convert the stress or excitement or happiness into something to be shared with another person.The beauty of the relationship between reading and writing is its give-and-take dynamic. For years I gathered and read every book in the near vicinity and absorbed tale upon tale, story upon story, adventures and sagas and dramas and classics. I fed my fancy, my tastes, and my ideas upon good books and thus those aspects of myself grew up to be none too shabby. When I began to employ my fancy, tastes, and ideas in writing my own books, the dawning of a strange and wonderful idea tinged the horizon of thought with blush-rose colors: If I persisted and worked hard and poured myself into the craft, I could create one of those books. One of the heart-books that foster a love of reading and even writing in another person somewhere. I could have a hand in forming another person's mind. A great responsibility and a great privilege that, and one I would love to be a party to. Books can change a person. I am a firm believer in that. I cannot tell you how many sentiments or noble ideas or parts of my own personality are woven from threads of things I've read over the years. I hoard quotations and shadows of quotations and general impressions of books like a tzar of Russia hoards his icy treasures. They make up a large part of who I am. I think it's worth saying again: books can change a person. For better or for worse. As a writer it's my two-edged gift to be able to slay or heal where I will. It's my responsibility to wield that weapon aright and do only good with my words. Or only purposeful cutting. I am not set against the surgeon's method of butchery--the nicking of a person's spirit, the rubbing in of a salty, stinging salve, and the ultimate healing-over of that wound that makes for a healthier person in the end. It's the bitter herbs that heal the best, so now and again you might be called upon to write something with more cayenne than honey about it. But the end must be good. We cannot let the Light fade from our words.": "Rachel",
  "When you start searching for \u2018pure elements\u2019 in literature you will find that literature has been created by the following classes of persons:  Inventors. Men who found a new process, or whose extant work gives us the first known example of a process. \n   The masters. Men who combined a number of such processes, and who used them as well as or better than the inventors. \n   The diluters. Men who came after the first two kinds of writer, and couldn\u2019t do the job quite as well. \n   Good writers without salient qualities. Men who are fortunate enough to be born when the literature of a given country is in good working order, or when some particular branch of writing is \u2018healthy\u2019. For example, men who wrote sonnets in Dante\u2019s time, men who wrote short lyrics in Shakespeare\u2019s time or for several decades thereafter, or who wrote French novels and stories after Flaubert had shown them how. \n   Writers of belles-lettres. That is, men who didn\u2019t really invent anything, but who specialized in some particular part of writing, who couldn\u2019t be considered as \u2018great men\u2019 or as authors who were trying to give a complete presentation of life, or of their epoch. \n   The starters of crazes.Until the reader knows the first two categories he will never be able \u2018to see the wood for the trees\u2019. He may know what he \u2018likes\u2019. He may be a \u2018compleat book-lover\u2019, with a large library of beautifully printed books, bound in the most luxurious bindings, but he will never be able to sort out what he knows to estimate the value of one book in relation to others, and he will be more confused and even less able to make up his mind about a book where a new author is \u2018breaking with convention\u2019 than to form an opinion about a book eighty or a hundred years old.He will never understand why a specialist is annoyed with him for trotting out a second- or third-hand opinion about the merits of his favourite bad writer. \n ": "Ezra",

  "I read daily, not so much for the benefit of my writing, but because I am addicted to it. There is nothing in the world for me that compares to being lost in a really good novel. That said, reading is an absolute must if you want to write. It is a trite enough thing to say, but very true nonetheless. I cannot understand aspiring writers who email me for advice and freely admit that they read very little. I have learned something from every writer I have ever read. Sometimes I have done so consciously, picking up something about how to frame a scene, or seeing a new possibility with regards to structure, or interesting ways to write dialogue. Other times, I think, my collective reading experience affects my sensibilities and informs me in ways that I am not quite aware of, but in real ways that impact how I approach writing. The short of it is, as an aspiring writer, there is nothing as damaging to your credibility as saying that you don\u2019t like to read": "Khaled",

All that before he drives the first nail. Everything is there in the blueprint.And then there's the gardener who digs the hole in the ground, puts in the seed and waters it with his blood and sees what comes up. The gardener knows certain things. He's not completely ignorant. He knows whether he planted an oak tree, or corn, or a cauliflower. He has some idea of the shape but a lot of it depends on the wind and the weather and how much blood he gives it and so forth.No one is purely an architect or a gardener in terms of a writer, but many writers tend to one side or the other.

  "The biggest spur to my interest in art came when I played van Gogh in the biographical film Lust For Life. The role affected me deeply. I was haunted by this talented genius who took his own life, thinking he was a failure. How terrible to paint pictures and feel that no one wants them. How awful it would be to write music that no one wants to hear. Books that no one wants to read. And how would you like to be an actor with no part to play, and no audience to watch you. Poor Vincent\u2014he wrestled with his soul in the wheat field of Auvers-sur-Oise, stacks of his unsold paintings collecting dust in his brother's house. It was all too much for him, and he pulled the trigger and ended it all. My heart ached for van Gogh the afternoon that I played that scene. As I write this, I look up at a poster of his \"Irises\"\u2014a poster from the Getty Museum. It's a beautiful piece of art with one white iris sticking up among a field of blue ones. They paid a fortune for it, reportedly $53 million. And poor Vincent, in his lifetime, sold only one painting for 400 francs or $80 dollars today. This is what stimulated my interest in buying works of art from living artists.

  "The viewpoint character in each story is usually someone trapped in a living nightmare, but this doesn't guarantee that we and the protagonist are at one. In fact Woolrich often makes us pull away from the person at the center of the storm, splitting our reaction in two, stripping his protagonist of moral authority, denying us the luxury of unequivocal identification, drawing characters so psychologically warped and sometimes so despicable that a part of us wants to see them suffer. Woolrich also denies us the luxury of total disidentification with all sorts of sociopaths, especially those who wear badges. His Noir Cop tales are crammed with acts of police sadism, casually committed or at least endorsed by the detective protagonist. These monstrosities are explicitly condemned almost never and the moral outrage we feel has no internal support in the stories except the objective horror of what is shown, so that one might almost believe that a part of Woolrich wants us to enjoy the spectacles. If so, it's yet another instance of how his most powerful novels and stories are divided against themselves so as to evoke in us a divided response that mirrors his own self-division.(\"Introduction\")": "Francis",

  "Woolrich had a genius for creating types of story perfectly consonant with his world: the noir cop story, the clock race story, the waking nightmare, the oscillation thriller, the headlong through the night story, the annihilation story, the last hours story. These situations, and variations on them, and others like them, are paradigms of our position in the world as Woolrich sees it. His mastery of suspense, his genius (like that of his spiritual brother Alfred Hitchcock) for keeping us on the edge of our seats and gasping with fright, stems not only from the nightmarish situations he conjured up but from his prose, which is compulsively readable, cinematically vivid, high-strung almost to the point of hysteria, forcing us into the skins of the hunted and doomed where we live their agonies and die with them a thousand small deaths.": "Francis",

I enjoy city life, you know,\" Magnus observed. \"The glittering lights, the constant companionship, the liquid entertainment. The lack of sudden monkeys.\"He ignored Giuliana's advice and took a smart step back, and also threw another piece of fruit. The monkey did not take the bait this time. He coiled and rattled out a growl, and Magnus took several more steps back and into a tree.Magnus flailed on impact, was briefly grateful that nobody was watching him and expecting him to be a sophisticated warlock, and had a monkey assault launched directly to his face.He shouted, spun, and sprinted through the rain forest. He did not even think to drop the fruit. It fell one by one in a bright cascade as he ran for his life from the simian menace. He heard it in hot pursuit and fled faster, until all his fruit was gone and he ran right into Ragnor.\"Have a care!\" Ragnor snapped.He detailed his terrible monkey adventure twice.\"But of course you should have retreated at once from the dominant male,\" Giuliana said. \"Are you an idiot? You are extremely lucky he was distracted from ripping out your throat by the fruit.

  "Mountains seem to answer an increasing imaginative need in the West. More and more people are discovering a desire for them, and a powerful solace in them. At bottom, mountains, like all wildernesses, challenge our complacent conviction - so easy to lapse into - that the world has been made for humans by humans. Most of us exist for most of the time in worlds which are humanly arranged, themed and controlled. One forgets that there are environments which do not respond to the flick of a switch or the twist of a dial, and which have their own rhythms and orders of existence. Mountains correct this amnesia. By speaking of greater forces than we can possibly invoke, and by confronting us with greater spans of time than we can possibly envisage, mountains refute our excessive trust in the man-made.

It's the same way with stories. One leads to the next, to the next, and to the next; maybe they go in the direction you wanted to go, but maybe they don't.

Realising that they would have to get Gilkey down immediately to have any hope of saving him, Schoening and the others started lowering him down the mountain's steep Abruzzi Ridge as the storm raged. At 25,000 feet, a climber named George Bell slipped and pulled four others off with him. Reflexively wrapping the rope around his shoulders and ice ax, Schoening somehow managed to single-handedly hold on to Gilkey and simultaneously arrest the slide of the five falling climbers without being pulled off the mountain himself.

  "I'd like to repeat the advice that I gave you before, in that I think you really should make a radical change in your lifestyle and begin to boldly do things which you may previously never have thought of doing, or been too hesitant to attempt. So many people live within unhappy circumstances and yet will not take the initiative to change their situation because they are conditioned to a life of security, conformity, and conservatism, all of which may appear to give one peace of mind, but in reality nothing is more damaging to the adventurous spirit within a man than a secure future. The very basic core of a man's living spirit is his passion for adventure. The joy of life comes from our encounters with new experiences, and hence there is no greater joy than to have an endlessly changing horizon, for each day to have a new and different sun.If you want to get more out of life, Ron, you must lose your inclination for monotonous security and adopt a helter-skelter style of life that will at first appear to you to be crazy. But once you become accustomed to such a life you will see its full meaning and its incredible beauty. And so, Ron, in short, get out of Salton City and hit the Road. I guarantee you will be very glad you did. But I fear that you will ignore my advice. You think that I am stubborn, but you are even more stubborn than me. You had a wonderful chance on your drive back to see one of the greatest sights on earth, the Grand Canyon, something every American should see at least once in his life. But for some reason incomprehensible to me you wanted nothing but to bolt for home as quickly as possible, right back to the same situation which you see day after day after day. I fear you will follow this same inclination in the future and thus fail to discover all the wonderful things that God has placed around us to discover.Don't settle down and sit in one place. Move around, be nomadic, make each day a new horizon. You are still going to live a long time, Ron, and it would be a shame if you did not take the opportunity to revolutionize your life and move into an entirely new realm of experience.You are wrong if you think Joy emanates only or principally from human relationships. God has placed it all around us. It is in everything and anything we might experience. We just have to have the courage to turn against our habitual lifestyle and engage in unconventional living.My point is that you do not need me or anyone else around to bring this new kind of light in your life. It is simply waiting out there for you to grasp it, and all you have to do is reach for it. The only person you are fighting is yourself and your stubbornness to engage in new circumstances.": "Jon",

  "Frank heard the glass of water thump on the stand that he now imagined might be beside the bed, which meant it was. Finally something firm to grasp, in his mind and with his hand. He reached out very slowly, as he didn\u2019t want to risk tearing the gauze that was so precariously holding his vital organs together. He felt wood. His fingers slid shakily over the corners of the table, feeling their reality, their solidity. He tried to picture it in his head, all rough hewn and unpainted, but the white kept slipping in, even though he knew Mexicans rarely painted anything with a neutral color. Still, there it was, a whitewashed bed stand in his mind. He tried to overlook it, and reached up higher to find the glass cylinder full of what his body was screaming out for, water.That was why he felt so tight, he figured. His tissues and muscles had all dried up, and he needed to rehydrate them before even attempting to move. So at last, grasping the all important container, his fingers straining against its mighty heft, he slowly slipped it to and then off of the edge of the little table. Vast oceans of bluey refuge sloshed against their constraints, spilling their powerful waves over the side, across his sleeping hand, and onto the bed sheets below that were undoubtedly as white as Santa\u2019s fucking beard.But the spill, the great cresting of the breakers over the levee walls, tremendous in its awesome power and glory, had only served to excite him, to intrigue him, the refreshment that the backside of his hand was lapping up osmotically served only to stoke the great thirst within him, and with God steadying his hand, he tipped his gauze laden head up, muscled the glass towards his mouth with veins rippling in his arms, and tipped it.It was not a perfect pour. Water splashed against his forehead, his eyes still clenched tightly in their death struggle against the white, as he had no idea where his mouth was at that point anyway. But he really didn\u2019t give a shit where the life giving fluid went, for he had become a very gauzey sponge, and his tissues would reach their strange and parched tendrils across the entire room if they must to soak up the precious juices that would in turn dissolve their steely grip and allow him to rise from his low perch and sallie forth across the blue fields of agave that awaited a non-suicidal tourist\u2019s itinerary, just outside the door he could not remember but which must surely be bolted to an opening that must surely be the gateway to the very room in which he must surely be attempting to drink.": "Thomas",

  "It was in a swampy village on the lagoon river behind the Turner Peninsula that Pollock's first encounter with the Porroh man occurred. The women of that country are famous for their good looks - they are Gallinas with a dash of European blood that dates from the days of Vasco da Gama and the English slave-traders, and the Porroh man, too, was possibly inspired by a faint Caucasian taint in his composition. (It's a curious thing to think that some of us may have distant cousins eating men on Sherboro Island or raiding with the Sofas.) At any rate, the Porroh man stabbed the woman to the heart as though he had been a mere low-class Italian, and very narrowly missed Pollock. But Pollock, using his revolver to parry the lightning stab which was aimed at his deltoid muscle, sent the iron dagger flying, and, firing, hit the man in the hand.He fired again and missed, knocking a sudden window out of the wall of the hut. The Porroh man stooped in the doorway, glancing under his arm at Pollock. Pollock caught a glimpse of his inverted face in the sunlight, and then the Englishman was alone, sick and trembling with the excitement of the affair, in the twilight of the place. It had all happened in less time than it takes to read about it.(\"Pollock And The Porroh Man\")": "H.G.",

It is at this site near Lake Brunner, between the main peak and an adjacent stone pyramid, in a \"hidden cave\" that has been sealed by earthquakes common in the region . . . where lust for Inca gold must end for some . . . but for that intrepid sole . . . it shall be just the beginning!": "Steven",

Jack said, \u201cReturn to Ahmity.\u201dThe ball slowly accompanied Jack back up the cliff. When he reached the top Ahmity helped him up over the edge and waited for his report. Jack wiped the sweat from his forehead and said, \u201cI could see a tunnel in the side of the cave about 10 feet inside the entrance. It\u2019s large enough for the trolls pass through.\u201dAhmity shook his head and said, \u201cIf the trolls traveled back to the Netherworld from here then it\u2019s possible the beasts escaped the same way.\u201dJack sighed and glanced back at the school then said, \u201cWell there\u2019s no way to know for sure unless we take a short trip down a black hole.\u201dComing soon--Vengeance's Fire": "Alaina",

At a dead run, they rounded the bend that had previously led to the red sky. The crashing noise of falling rock echoed by them and they backed up to the side of the tunnel. Benter held his finger up to his mouth. He slowly edged forward to peek back beyond the bend. The colossal dragon tried to dig and burn its way into the tunnel, but it was ten times the size of the tunnel opening. The beast inhaled a deep breath, seemingly to suck every bit of air from the tunnel. Benter felt himself breathe harder, becoming lightheaded. The dragon continued to inhale and Benter realized the exhale would be a huge fire bomb. \u201cRUN!\u201d yelled Benter, but Jake had read his mind and was already ahead of him running as fast as he could. Within seconds of their exit the dragon released the fire missile and great licking flames raced towards them in a hungry fervor.": "M.K.",

They do not grow weary nor miss step, nor do they fall out of rank and sink by the wayside to be left contemplating the moving procession.Ah! that moving procession that has left me by the road-side! Its fantastic colors are more brilliant and beautiful than the sun on the undulating waters. What matter if souls and bodies are failing beneath the feet of the ever-pressing multitude!

Youth is the natural time for revolt, for experiment, for a generous idealism that is eager for action. Any civilisation which has the wisdom of self-preservation will allow a certain margin of freedom for the expression of this youthful mood. But the plain, unpalatable fact is that in America today that margin of freedom has been reduced to the vanishing point. Rebellious youth is not wanted here. In our environment there is nothing to challenge our young men; there is no flexibility, no colour, no possibility for adventure, no chance to shape events more generously than is permitted under the rules of highly organised looting.

  "There is an inherent, humbling cruelty to learning how to run white water. In most other so-called \"adrenaline\" sports\u2014skiing, surfing and rock climbing come to mind\u2014one attains mastery, or the illusion of it, only after long apprenticeship, after enduring falls and tumbles, the fatigue of training previously unused muscles, the discipline of developing a new and initially awkward set of skills.Running white water is fundamentally different. With a little luck one is immediately able to travel long distances, often at great speeds, with only a rudimentary command of the sport's essential skills and about as much physical stamina as it takes to ride a bicycle downhill. At the beginning, at least, white-water adrenaline comes cheap.It's the river doing the work, of course, but like a teenager with a hot car, one forgets what the true power source is. Arrogance reigns. The river seems all smoke and mirrors, lots of bark (you hear it chortling away beneath you, crunching boulders), but not much bite. You think: Let's get on with it! Let's run this damn river!And then maybe the raft hits a drop in the river\u2014 say, a short, hidden waterfall. Or maybe a wave reaches up and flicks the boat on its side as easily as a horse swatting flies with its tail. Maybe you're thrown suddenly into the center of the raft, and the floor bounces back and punts you overboard. Maybe you just fall right off the side of the raft so fast you don't realize what's happening.It doesn't matter. The results are the same.The world goes dark. The river\u2014 the word hardly does justice to the churning mess enveloping you\u2014 the river tumbles you like so much laundry. It punches the air from your lungs. You're helpless. Swimming is a joke. You know for a fact that you are drowning. For the first time you understand the strength of the insouciant monster that has swallowed you.Maybe you travel a hundred feet before you surface (the current is moving that fast). And another hundred feet\u2014just short of a truly fearsome plunge, one that will surely kill you\u2014 before you see the rescue lines. You're hauled to shore wearing a sheepish grin and a look in your eye that is equal parts confusion, respect, and raw fear.That is River Lesson Number One. Everyone suffers it.

  "A false religion is like the imitation of high fashion. The very presence of counterfeits proves the existence of the real. There would be no imitations without a genuine product. God\u2019s original design has always had imitators and counterfeits!": "Billy",
  "In this age of humanism, man is seduced by society with the lie that he can become his own god . . . the New Age movement is polluted with self and it will never bow before God\u2014at least not until Christ returns.": "Billy",
  "Modern Western culture has become a mixture of paganism and Christianity. We are a blend of both. We talk of God, but we often act as though we are atheists.": "Billy",
  "New Agers are terrified of their own mortality, and they want to believe that somehow the soul will survive. Of course it will, but not as they imagine.": "Billy",
  "There are many religions in the world, and they have developed because various people have had various ideas about God. Christianity makes a unique claim . . . we can know God because He came to us in human form in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Man has naturally and universally a capacity for religion\u2014and not only a capacity, for the vast majority of the human race practices or professes some form of religion.": "Billy",
  "I am convinced that hundreds of religious leaders throughout the world today are servants not of God, but of the Antichrist. They are wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing; they are tares instead of wheat.": "Billy",
  "Every journey has a starting point . . . and it has an end. God meant for [life] to be filled with joy and purpose. He invites us to . . . take the rest of our journey with Him.": "Billy",
  "There comes a moment when we all must realize that life is short, and in the end the only thing that really counts is not how others see us, but how God sees us.": "Billy",
  "A century ago man\u2019s chief concern was his spiritual life": "today",
  "Nothing could be more wrong than the old clich\u00e9 that says any religion will do just as long as one is sincere. In no other area of life is there so much error, deception, and charlatanism as in religion.": "Billy",
  "The one who made the Ford knew how to make it run. God made you and me, and He alone knows how to run your life and mine. We could make a complete wreck of our lives without Christ.": "Billy",
  "Sometimes we get a little tired of the burdens of life, but it is exhilarating to know that Jesus Christ will meet us at the end of life\u2019s journey.": "Billy",
  "End your journey well. Don\u2019t waste your life, and don\u2019t be satisfied with anything less than God\u2019s plan.": "Billy",
  "Many a life has come forth from the furnace of affliction more beautiful and more useful than before.": "Billy",
  "You can have religion but not know Christ. It\u2019s having Christ that counts.": "Billy",
  "Christianity is not a white man\u2019s religion and don\u2019t let anybody ever tell you that it\u2019s white or black. Christ belongs to all people": "he",
  "Religion,\u201d [some] argue, \u201cmay be all right for certain emotional people, but you can\u2019t beat a man who believes in himself.\u201d But this self-confident generation has produced more alcoholics, more dope addicts, more criminals, more wars, more broken homes, more assaults, more embezzlements, more murders, and more suicides than any other generation that ever lived. It is time for all of us to take stock of our failures, blunders, and costly mistakes. It is about time that we put less confidence in ourselves and more trust and faith in God.": "Billy",
  "People of the West have various forms of democracy based on a belief in God as well as on a general acceptance of moral law. However, in practice we are beginning to resemble the Marxists, who have little respect for moral law or religion.": "Billy",
  "Hundreds of philosophies and scores of religions have been invented to circumvent the Word of God. Modern philosophers and psychologists are still trying to make it appear that there is some way out other than the path of Jesus.": "Billy",
  "Astrology can never give you the answers to life\u2019s deepest questions\u2014especially where you will spend eternity. Commit your life to Christ. It will give you joyous confidence that your future is securely in His hands\u2014tomorrow and forever.": "Billy",
  "Nothing seems to satisfy. Not politics, not education, not material goods. Some who refuse to turn their hearts toward God have created the New Age movement, with all of its aberrations. This is actually not new but only the latest attempt by man to place something other than Christ inside himself in a futile attempt to satisfy spiritual longings.": "Billy",
  "While the West had lulled itself to sleep with the comforting doctrine of man\u2019s achievements, a great revolution had been in progress in Russia. The hammer pounded and the sickle gleaned until a new social order called Communism emerged as one of the most powerful ideologies of all time. It challenged every concept man had ever held. It threatened the life of the whole world. It became the greatest challenge Christianity had faced in 2,000 years. It was a fanatic religion that asked questions and demanded answers.": "Billy",
  "Students today want to know about the devil, about witchcraft, about the occult. Many people do not know they are turning to Satan. They are being deluded.": "Billy",
  "Religion can be anything! But true Christianity is God coming to man in a personal relationship.": "Billy",
  "We see that humanism has become for many a polite name for a vocal, aggressive, influential crusade against religion in the name of social and moral advance. There is nothing new about humanism. It is the yielding to Satan\u2019s first temptation of Adam and Eve: \u201cYe shall be as gods\u201d [Genesis 3:5 KJV].": "Billy",
  "Man suppresses the truth, mixes it with error, and develops the religions of the world.": "Billy",
  "Only God knows the future and that we are to look to Him\u2014not to the stars or the tea leaves or the lines on the palms of our hands\u2014for our confidence in the future.": "Billy",
  "Some Christian leaders . . . are willing to give up some of the teachings of the Bible in order to harmonize Christianity with the other religions.": "Billy",
  "Something distinguishes Christianity from all the religions of the world. Not only does it carry the truth of the redemption, by the death of our Savior for our sins on the cross, but it carries the fact that Christ rose again.": "Billy",
  "There are many bibles of different religions; there is the Mohammedan Koran, the Buddhist Canon of Sacred Scripture, the Zoroastrian Zend-Avesta, and the Brahman Veda . . . they all begin with some flashes of true light, and end in utter darkness. Even the most casual observer soon discovers that the Bible is radically different. It is the only Book that offers redemption to us and points the way out of our dilemma.": "Billy",
  "I never try to defend religion. Religion has spawned wars. Many so-called religious people have been characterized by prejudice, pride, and bickering . . . I would call you to a simple faith in Jesus, who said, \u201cLove your neighbor as yourself.": "Billy",
  "Christianity is being compared with other religions as never before. Some so-called Christian leaders even advocate the working out of a system of morals, ethics, and religion that would bring together all the religions of the world. It cannot be done. Jesus Christ is unique.": "Billy",
  "In order to compete with God for the dominion of the world, Satan, whom Christ called \u201cthe prince of this world,\u201d was forced to go into the \u201creligion\u201d business.": "Billy",
  "We live in an upside-down world, in which people hate what they should love and love what they should hate.": "Billy",
  "We\u2019re heading for a world showdown, a worldwide confrontation. If we think we can solve our problems without God, then we\u2019re living in a fool\u2019s paradise.": "Billy",
  "We have a mandate to speak out against \u201cthe sin that so easily entangles\u201d [Hebrews 12:1 NIV]; for though we are not of the world, we are still in it.": "Billy",
  "The world I once knew as a boy has changed dramatically . . . I don\u2019t even recognize the world we live in today.": "Billy",
  "The world judges the Christian by his life, not by his belief.": "Billy",
  "There is only one passion that can help us control the many other passions that plague us; that is the passion to know and obey God. When we get out of touch with Christ, we begin touching the things of the world, trying to fill the void that human flesh craves.": "Billy",
  "The world\u2019s sewage system threatens to contaminate the stream of Christian thought. Satan will contest every hour you spend in Bible reading or prayer.": "Billy",
  "Our chaotic, confused world has no greater need than to hear the Gospel truth.": "Billy",
  "There are no new sins\u2014only new sinners. There are no new crimes\u2014only new criminals, No new evils\u2014only new evildoers. No new pleasures\u2014only new pleasure seekers. We must distinguish between wholesome, God-ordained pleasure and sinful, worldly pleasure.": "Billy",
  "The world by its advertisements, its conversation, and its philosophy is engaged in a gigantic brainwashing task . . . The Christian is beset by secular and worldly propaganda.": "Billy",
  "The world may argue against a creed, but it cannot argue against changed lives.": "Billy",
  "While we\u2019re looking up to see the rainbow\u2014God\u2019s promises\u2014we\u2019re ignoring floodwaters rising. While we\u2019re looking down to see how close we can get to the edge of the world without being trapped by Satan, we\u2019re taking our eyes off of Christ.": "Billy",
  "How do we counter the trend of worldliness? We must saturate our minds, hearts, and souls with God\u2019s Word. The Bible says, \u201cTrain yourself to be godly\u201d (1 Timothy 4:7).": "Billy",
  "In the struggle for righteousness, there is nothing more helpful than being passionately in tune with Christ through His Spirit and being passionately committed to doing His will. It has been said that in order to tune in to God\u2019s voice, we must tune out this world\u2019s noise.": "Billy",
  "We are never to do anything of which we are not perfectly clear and certain. If you have a doubt about that particular thing that is bothering you, as to whether it is worldly or not, the best policy is \u201cdon\u2019t do it.": "Billy",
  "I have heard the hollow, shallow laughter of the world. I have heard the genuine laughter of the beaming young Christian. I know there is a difference.": "Billy",
  "When you are unsure whether or not something is wrong, ask yourself these questions: Does this glorify God? Can I offer a prayer of thanksgiving for it? Does it draw me closer to Christ, or does it make me preoccupied with this world? Will it harm my health or hurt me in some other way? Will it cause someone else to stumble spiritually or morally? I have never forgotten what a wise Christian said to me many years ago: \u201cWhen in doubt\u2014don\u2019t!": "Billy",
  "As for the world system of evil, we are to be separated from it. This then is our problem: to associate with and love those who are involved in the world without being contaminated, influenced, or swayed by them. This distinction can be achieved only by a close walk with Christ, by constant prayer, and by seeking the Holy Spirit\u2019s leadership every hour of the day. We are in the world, but the world is not to be in us.": "Billy",
  "Any history of the political events of our time which does not also include a discussion of the Bible, the impact of Christianity, and the role of faith in changing the hearts and minds of people all over the world is an incomplete and invalid study. For what is taking place in the world today is not just a protest, but a revolution in the sphere of the human heart.": "Billy",
  "Any Christian whose interest is directed toward himself is worldly.": "Billy",
  "When we come to Christ, God calls us out of this world\u2019s sin and confusion. But then He sends us back into the world\u2014not to share any longer in its sin and spiritual darkness, but to bear witness to the light of Christ.": "Billy",
  "Jesus told His disciples that the \u201cworld,\u201d meaning the world system, the political and social order organized apart from God, will despise Christians.": "Billy",
  "It is easy for Christians to allow themselves to be squeezed into the world\u2019s mold . . . When nonbelievers see nothing different in the lifestyle of believers, they wonder if our profession of faith is sincere.": "Billy",
  "Those who believe [in Christ] are expected to be different from the world . . . they are members of a new society.": "Billy",
  "Jesus invited us not to a picnic, but to a pilgrimage. He offered us, not an excursion, but an execution. Our Savior said that we would have to be ready to die to self, sin, and the world.": "Billy",
  "Have you fallen into the world\u2019s trap, following its self-indulgent goals and driven by its self-centered motives? It can happen without you even being aware of it. Make sure Christ is first in your life, and make it your goal to live according to His Word.": "Billy",
  "Those who have actually experienced daily fellowship with Christ know that it surpasses all worldly activities.": "Billy",
  "There are so many professing Christians who are walking hand in hand with the world that you cannot tell the difference between the Christian and the unbeliever. This should never be.": "Billy",
  "As Christians, we are not to get our worlds mixed up . . . We are not to mingle with the world, but we are to witness to the world.": "Billy",
  "The Christian should stand out like a sparkling diamond against a rough background. He should be more wholesome than anyone else. He should be poised, cultured, courteous, gracious, but firm in the things that he does and does not do. He should laugh and be radiant, but he should refuse to allow the world to pull him down to its level.": "Billy",
  "Do not expect me to fall in with the evil customs and ways of the world. I am in Rome, but I will not do as Rome does. I am an alien, a stranger, and a foreigner. My citizenship is in heaven.": "Billy",
  "It is only the consecrated, Spirit-filled Christian who can have victory over the world, the flesh, and the devil. It is the Holy Spirit who will do the fighting for you.": "Billy",
  "When the Christian brings the standards of Jesus Christ to bear upon life in a material and secular world, it is often resented. Because the moral and spiritual demands of Jesus Christ are so high, they often set the Christian \u201capart.": "Billy",
  "Worldliness is actually a spirit, an atmosphere, an influence permeating the whole of life and human society, and it needs to be guarded against constantly and strenuously.": "Billy",
  "In the world in which we live, we give most attention to satisfying the appetites of the body and practically none to the soul . . . We become fat physically and materially, while spiritually we are lean, weak, and anemic.": "Billy",
  "Too many people today want a brotherly worldin which they can remain unbrotherly": "a",
  "Our world needs to be touched by Christians who are Spirit-filled, Spirit-led, and Spirit-empowered.": "Billy",
  "The entire world is in turmoil. We are living in a time of enormous conflict and cultural transformation. We have been stunned by shockwaves of change in nation after nation, all around the globe.": "Billy",
  "Too many people want to have one foot in the world and one foot in the kingdom of God, and it is like straddling a fence. You are not happy either way. Declare yourself for Christ.": "Billy",
  "Worldliness doesn\u2019t fall like an avalanche upon a person and sweep him or her away. It is the steady drip, drip, drip of the water that wears away the stone. The world is exerting a steady pressure on us every day. Most of us would go down under it, if it weren\u2019t for the Holy Spirit who lives inside us, and holds us up, and keeps us.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that we are to live in this world, but we are not to partake of the evils of the world. We are to be separated from the world of evil. When I face something in the world, I ask: \u201cDoes it violate any principle of Scripture? Does it take the keen edge off my Christian life? Can I ask God\u2019s blessing on it? Will it be a stumbling block to others? Would I like to be there, or reading that, or be watching that, if Christ should return at that time?": "Billy",
  "We act as if it doesn\u2019t matter how we live or what we think or say. We have moved in with the world, and we have allowed the world to penetrate the way we live. So the things that we used to call sin no longer seem to be sin to us.": "Billy",
  "We live in a hostile world that constantly seeks to pull us away from God.": "Billy",
  "Far too many young people coming of age today have no spiritual or emotional roots. They have been deprived of values by an agnostic and contemporary culture.": "Billy",
  "Our magazine shelves are filled with crime and sex pulp-magazines that are being read and devoured by millions of young people . . .Scores are seeing each week the trash that Hollywood produces. Truly our children are \u201cmovie mad.": "Billy",
  "I don\u2019t believe that young people today can live clean, pure lives without the help of God. The peer pressure is too great and the temptations they see in the movies and on television, and what they hear in their music is too much. Only Christ can give them the power to say no.": "Billy",
  "Do you know what nearly all the sociologists say today in their study of young people? The greatest problem facing young people today is not sex\u2014it is boredom.": "Billy",
  "Our youth are desperately searching for purpose and meaning in their lives. They are searching for fulfillment . . . I believe that a return to biblical conversion, faith, and conviction would have a great impact in our day.": "Billy",
  "Where students talk about being independent and on their own, you will find them practicing the most rigid conformity in dress, in speech, in moral attitudes, and in thinking. Sometimes they follow fashion at the expense of integrity. They dread to be alone. They do not want to stand out or be different. They want to conform. After they graduate from college, many of these young people want nothing more than a good job with a big firm, and a home somewhere in suburbia. But they don\u2019t find security.": "Billy",
  "There is a great identity crisis among students today. Who am I? What is the purpose of life? Where did I come from? Where am I going? The Bible has a direct answer to this great big philosophical question and unless God seals the vacuum among youth today, then some other ideology will, because young people must have a faith. They must believe in something to find fulfillment in their lives.": "Billy",
  "I have found that most young people really want us to spell out a moral code. They may not accept it or believe it, but they want to hear it, clearly and without compromise.": "Billy",
  "In America we have an idolatry called the \u201cadulation of youth.\u201d Apparently distressed by their inability to communicate with the younger generation, many adults simply imitate it.": "Billy",
  "If we would take the traits that characterized the Pilgrims and make them our own, we could regain hope. We could recover the spiritual and moral strength that we have lost. We could offer a thrilling challenge to our young people.": "Billy",
  "Millions of young people are shifting from one side to the other. They are like unguided missiles filled with energy and ambition and yet somehow not \u201cfitting in.\u201d Peer pressure leads them astray . . . [and] in thousands of churches they are led astray theologically.": "Billy",
  "All young people sin, and sin produces discord, repellent vibrations which rifle the concert of life until the strings are gutless and flat. The kicks soon lead to kickbacks.": "Billy",
  "[Young people,] dress as attractively as you can. You are an aristocrat, a child of God.": "Billy",
  "In earlier periods of history, adolescence was virtually unknown . . . Today, the span between childhood and adulthood may extend over ten years. Deferred adulthood is synonymous with deferred responsibility.": "Billy",
  "Young people are experts on leisure, water skiing, dancing, rock music, rapping, TV watching . . . by and large, chores are a thing of the past.": "Billy",
  "Wherever the Word of God is hidden or ignored, there will be certain destruction.": "Billy",
  "Young people are caught up in whatever appears to be the most bizarre. They look for truth and settle for folly. False religions and the occult are clever in reaching seekers who want to experience a rush of any kind.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t rebel, but give God the opportunity to change your life and help you over the problems of youth, for they are many.": "Billy",
  "Parents do overindulge their children, giving them a profusion of material things . . . without the stabilizing effects of earning one\u2019s way, of making decisions, of sweating hard to attain some kind of goal, young people are grievously handicapped.": "Billy",
  "Do young people have the moral stamina to carry through in case of economic depression? . . . The real tests of the [younger] generations have not yet come, but they are on their way!": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that there will be a famine of the Word of God in the last days . . . spiritual starvation leads to spiritual death.": "Billy",
  "Confrontation is the special business of young people. They confront their parents, peers, society, law enforcement officers, and themselves, but primarily they confront God.": "Billy",
  "What is the most difficult word for young people to pronounce? It\u2019s the word no. When we say no [to what is against God], He will help us to stand by it. He will give us courage.": "Billy",
  "I am in favor of hanging the Ten Commandments in every schoolroom in the country so young people can know the difference between right and wrong. They don\u2019t know the difference and we\u2019re seeing the evidence of that all around us every day.": "Billy",
  "I come in contact with mixed-up people, young men and women caught in the anguish of their own unpreparedness, intellectuals who have been seduced by false science, and rich men held in the grip of insecurity. They have no commitment to any goal. They lack an anchorage for their real self. And I long to take every one of them by the hand and lead them into the presence of the One who said, \u201cCome unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest\u201d [Matthew 11:28 KJV].": "Billy",
  "It is strange that the world accepts enthusiasm in every realm but the spiritual.": "Billy",
  "We don\u2019t live in an ideal world, but in a world dominated by sinful, selfish desires.": "Billy",
  "Much of the world believes little or nothing. People are broad but shallow. Agnosticism, anxiety, emptiness, and meaninglessness have gripped much of the world\u2014and even the church . . . By contrast, our Pilgrim forebears stand as shining examples of men who were narrow but deep, certain of what they believed, unswerving in their loyalty, and passionately dedicated to the God they trusted, and for whom they would willingly have died.": "Billy",
  "Worldliness is an inner attitude that puts self at the center of life instead of God.": "Billy",
  "Too many times we are concerned with how much, instead of how little, like this [world] we can become.": "Billy",
  "The saddest words I can ever imagine would be to hear the Lord say, \u201cI never knew you. Away from Me\u201d [Matthew 7:23 NIV].": "Billy",
  "It often takes a tragedy to open our hearts, minds, and wills to the truth of God\u2019s Word.": "Billy",
  "While those around you are filling their minds with the bad news about man in their daily papers, steep yourself in the good news about God in His precious Word!": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t argue with [a professor], but test everything he says in the light of God\u2019s Word.": "Billy",
  "We need to fortify ourselves with the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "I look upon it as a lost day when I have not had a good time over the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Some, who doubt that the Bible is the true Word of God, doubt it because they are unwilling to ascribe to God anything they cannot themselves achieve.": "Billy",
  "[God the Spirit] will never lead you contrary to the Word of God. I hear people saying, \u201cThe Lord led me to do this . . .\u201d I am always a little suspicious unless what the Lord has said is in keeping with His Word.": "Billy",
  "Your spiritual life needs food . . . where do you find [this]? In the Bible, the Word of God. The Bible reveals Christ, who is the Bread of Life for your hungry soul, and the Water of Life for your thirsty heart.": "Billy",
  "God has not promised to bless my thoughts, but He has promised to bless His Word.": "Billy",
  "Faith grows when it is planted in the fertile soil of God\u2019s Word.": "Billy",
  "As Christians, we have only one authority, one compass: the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Nothing will help us grow spiritually more than spending time alone with God every day, reading His Word and praying. Time alone with God is essential to our spiritual welfare.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s Word not only gives authority to one\u2019s ministry": "it",
  "The Old Testament may not seem relevant to us today\u2014but it is, because it is part of God\u2019s Holy Word, and He has much to teach us through its pages.": "Billy",
  "Through the written Word we discover the Living Word\u2014Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "God never leads us to do anything that is contrary to His Word. But the opposite is also true: God always leads us to do everything that is in agreement with His Word.": "Billy",
  "The Word of God hidden in the heart is a stubborn voice to suppress.": "Billy",
  "Who can tell us how to get along with each other better than God? Where can we turn for wisdom better than God\u2019s Word, the Bible?": "Billy",
  "O God! There are many things in [the Bible] I do not understand . . . I am going to accept this as Thy Word\u2014by faith! I\u2019m going to allow faith to go beyond my intellectual questions and doubts, and I will believe this to be Your inspired Word.": "Billy",
  "A computer . . . has no worth unless it is programmed . . . The believer has tremendous potential, but that potential cannot be used until he is programmed with the Word of God.": "Billy",
  "The Spirit of God takes the Word of God and makes the child of God.": "Billy",
  "When I quote Scripture, I know I am quoting the very Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Scientific discoveries (not theories) are found more and more to fit into the record God has given us in His Word.": "Billy",
  "The fact that God is infinite makes the study of His Word a lifetime occupation.": "Billy",
  "Oh that we would hunger to be filled with the Word of God; for there is no greater armor, no greater strength, no greater assurance that He is with us, and in us, when we go forth in battle equipped and nourished by His instruction and determined to stand firm on His promises.": "Billy",
  "God and God\u2019s Word are inseparable.": "Billy",
  "I have never known a man who received Christ and ever regretted it.": "Billy",
  "Compared to when I was a boy, we now live in reverse. The people are locked up in their homes at night and criminals are outside on the loose! When I was young, the criminals were locked up and the people were free to move about. That time has passed for many cities.": "Billy",
  "The central theme of the universe is the purpose and destiny of every individual. Every person is important in God\u2019s eyes.": "Billy",
  "In our day many people are broad but shallow. Agnosticism, anxiety, and emptiness have gripped much of our world.": "Billy",
  "No area of human life is so full of difficulties and heartaches as relationships. If you listed everything that upset you during the past week, I suspect most had to do with other people. People can be selfless and kind, but they can also be difficult, stubborn, ego-driven, thoughtless, mean, selfish, manipulative. But the problem is not just other people; it\u2019s also ourselves.": "Billy",
  "Man is not growing better! Man is not climbing upward. Instead of progress in man himself there is degeneracy\u2014degeneracy of body, mind, and spirit. Man is going downhill.": "Billy",
  "Success stories may be great motivational material for sales seminars, but we are not always successful.": "Billy",
  "Time and tide and the ravages of sin take their toll on the most noble achievements of man.": "Billy",
  "Our job in life is not to be successful, but to be faithful.": "Billy",
  "This age is interested in success, not suffering . . . Our Lord was ridiculed, insulted, persecuted, and eventually killed. In the face of opposition, He went about \u201cdoing good.": "Billy",
  "Many of the wicked are receiving their wages now. Many Christians who may not be succeeding according to the world\u2019s standards now, will reap great rewards in heaven.": "Billy",
  "The Western world\u2019s sole objective seems to be success, status, security, self-indulgence, pleasure, and comfort.": "Billy",
  "Success or failure cannot be measured by any human standard.": "Billy",
  "God measures people by the small dimensions of humility and not by the bigness of their achievements or the size of their capabilities.": "Billy",
  "God can take anything that happens to us\u2014even bad things\u2014and use it to shape us and make us into a better, more Christlike person\u2014if we will let Him.": "Billy",
  "There are three of you. There is the person you think you are. There is the person others think you are. There is the person God knows you are and can be through Christ.": "Billy",
  "Our personalities, our intelligence, and our capabilities are gifts from [God\u2019s] own bountiful hand. If we divert their use for our own profit, we become guilty of selfishness.": "Billy",
  "Almost nothing is as complex as the human personality, and no simple formula will ever cover every situation or every relationship.": "Billy",
  "People are little creatures with big capacities, finite beings with infinite desires, deserving nothing but demanding all. God made people with this huge capacity and desire in order that He might come in and completely satisfy that desire.": "Billy",
  "A true servant of God is someone who helps another succeed.": "Billy",
  "I am becoming aware of the truth that people change people as much as ideas change people.The power of personality is strong . . . often personality is greater than the idea.": "Billy",
  "The Bible says that God sees two classes of men. He sees the saved and the lost, those who are going to heaven and those who are going to hell.": "Billy",
  "Lying is one of the worst of all sins and can be committed by a thought, word, or deed. Anything that is intended to deceive another person is lying.": "Billy",
  "As men and women seek to find independence from God, they have lost a sense of purpose in life. The worth of human personality is often equated with what we do for a living. However, a person\u2019s occupation, community standing, or bank account is not what is important in God\u2019s eyes.": "Billy",
  "Tell me why the gardener trims and prunes his rosebushes, sometimes cutting away productive branches, and I will tell you why God\u2019s people are afflicted. God\u2019s hand never slips.": "Billy",
  "All around you are people who need Christ: your family, your neighbors, people you work with or go to school with every day. Are you praying for them, asking God to open the door of their hearts to His truth?": "Billy",
  "Someday all of us will give account of the way we have used the gifts God has given. The person to whom much has been given will find much required of him.": "Billy",
  "I have never met a person who didn\u2019t have problems of some kind. This is why we need one another\u2019s encouragement.": "Billy",
  "In our desire to achieve success quickly it is easy to get our values mixed up and call evil good and good evil.": "Billy",
  "Instead of manipulating [people] for our own purposes, we\u2019d help them achieve what is best for them. We\u2019d also try to see life through their eyes. Treat others the way you would want them to treat you.": "Billy",
  "If the other person would just do things my way, we could get along,\u201d one says, when the other person is probably thinking the same about us\u2014that leads to conflict. Our deepest problems are within ourselves.": "Billy",
  "Man boasts of his nobility, his ideals, and his progress. Man\u2019s goal is imitation, not redemption.": "Billy",
  "Man persists in waywardness. If one institution fails [he says], try another\u2014anything but God\u2019s plan.": "Billy",
  "Some of the most miserable people I have ever met have been people who are very popular with the public, but down inside are empty and miserable.": "Billy",
  "Proclaiming \u201cthe whole will of God\u201d should be the goal\u2014and the joy\u2014of every church and every preacher.": "Billy",
  "Our souls have a disease. It causes all the troubles and difficulties in the world. It causes all the troubles, confusions, and disillusionments in your own life. The name of the disease is . . . sin.": "Billy",
  "We spend all our time and energy pampering our bodies and minds, but if we ignore our souls, we will end up spiritually starved and malnourished.": "Billy",
  "Take care of your soul\u2014your inner self\u2014by feeding on the Word of God and letting His Spirit transform you from within.": "Billy",
  "Christ taught that in the sight of God one soul is worth the entire materialistic world! In God\u2019s sight the individual is all-important. When Christ calls a man to follow Him, He calls him \u201cout\u201d from the \u201cgroup.\u201d Christ can fill the vacuums. He can restore your personal identity. He can become the truth to your generation.": "Billy",
  "Nothing can calm our souls more or better prepare us for life\u2019s challenges than time spent alone with God.": "Billy",
  "You should no more allow sinful imaginations to accumulate in your mind and soul than you would let garbage collect in your living room.": "Billy",
  "I have not known of too many people who found Christ on their deathbeds. When we come to Christ in our youth, a life is saved. When we come in old age, a soul is salvaged and life eternal is assured; but the opportunity to live a life for Christ has been lost.": "Billy",
  "Someday your life will be over, no matter how much attention you give to your health. Will you look back with regret, because you nourished your body but starved your soul?": "Billy",
  "We spend enormous amounts of time and money on fad diets, expensive exercise machines, and health clubs. For many people, these things only demonstrate their preoccupation with the physical side of life . . . but even more important is taking care of our souls.": "Billy",
  "Partial education throughout the world is far worse than none at all if we educate the mind but not the soul.": "Billy",
  "Unless the soul is fed and exercised daily, it becomes weak and shriveled. It remains discontented, confused, restless.": "Billy",
  "God requires something of us. We must confess our spiritual poverty, renounce our sins, and turn by faith to His Son, Jesus Christ. When we do that, we are born again. He gives us a new nature. He puts a little bit of heaven down in our souls.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that whether we are saved or lost, there is conscious and everlasting existence of the soul and personality.": "Billy",
  "May we all storm the gates of heaven for the souls of the anguished, that in their greatest time of need they will hear the gentle voice of God\u2019s Spirit calling them to repentance.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that you are an immortal soul. Your soul is eternal and will live forever . . . the real you\u2014the part of you that thinks, feels, dreams, aspires; the ego, the personality\u2014will never die . . . your soul will live forever in one of two places\u2014heaven or hell.": "Billy",
  "Even in the darkest moment, before death snatches man\u2019s last breath, God is willing to save a lost soul.": "Billy",
  "It is a time for soul-searching, a time to see if our anchor holds.": "Billy",
  "The soul actually demands as much attention as the body . . . the soul was made for God, and without God it is restless and in secret torment.": "Billy",
  "The searchlight of [God\u2019s] Spirit will probe the inner depths of your soul and reveal things that you think you have already yielded, but you have not.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches whether we are saved or lost, there is an everlasting existence of the soul.": "Billy",
  "Hardship is not our choice; but if we face it bravely, it can toughen the fiber of our souls.": "Billy",
  "Our soul is that part of our being which possesses intelligence, conscience, and memory\u2014the real personality. Your body will die, but your soul lives on. And that soul has a \u201csixth sense\u201d\u2014the ability to believe, to have faith.": "Billy",
  "Our souls set us apart from every other living creature, and that makes us unique. It also makes us fully human.": "Billy",
  "Let [Christ] transform your life so that you will have a glow on your face, a spring in your step, and joy in your soul.": "Billy",
  "Where do we get the notion that our idea of success and God\u2019s are the same? You have written a book; you are a clever manager and promoter; you are a talented artist; you are independently wealthy; you have achieved fame and fortune. Without the gifts of intelligence, imagination, personality, and physical energy\u2014which are all endowed by God\u2014where would you be?": "Billy",
  "Our world is obsessed with success. But how does God define success? Success in God\u2019s eyes is faithfulness to His calling.": "Billy",
  "Regardless of our cleverness, our achievements, and our gadgets, we are spiritual paupers without God.": "Billy",
  "Preach with authority. The authority for us is the Word of God. Preach with simplicity . . . Preach with urgency . . . heaven and hell are at stake. Preach for a decision.": "Billy",
  "Thousands of pastors, Sunday school teachers, and Christian workers are powerless because they do not make the Word the source of their preaching or teaching.": "Billy",
  "Nowhere in Mark 16:15\u2014\u201cGo ye into all the world, and preach the gospel to every creature\u201d [KJV] \u2014 nor in any similar Scripture did Christ command us to go only into the Western or capitalist world. Nowhere did He say to exclude the Communist world.": "Billy",
  "I have had the privilege of preaching the Gospel on every continent in most of the countries of the world, and I have found that when I present the simple message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ, with authority, quoting from the very Word of God\u2014He takes that message and drives it supernaturally into the human heart.": "Billy",
  "When I preach\u2014no matter where it is in the world\u2014I can always count on five areas of human need that afflict all peoples. Emptiness, loneliness, guilt, fear of death, deep-seated insecurity.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s strength is made perfect in weakness. The weaker I became, the more powerful became the preaching.": "Billy",
  "Preachers are not salesmen, for they have nothing to sell. They are bearers of Good News.": "Billy",
  "I\u2019m not a great preacher, and I don\u2019t claim to be a great preacher . . . I\u2019m an ordinary preacher, just communicating the Gospel in the best way I know how.": "Billy",
  "We preach Christ crucified. The cross is the focal point in the life and ministry of Jesus Christ. It was no afterthought or emergency measure with God. Christ was \u201cthe Lamb slain from the foundation of the world\u201d [Revelation 3:8 KJV].": "Billy",
  "Oh God, if You want me to preach, I will do it.": "Billy",
  "As the people came to a desert place to hear John the Baptist proclaim, \u201cThus saith the Lord,\u201d so [man] in his confusions, frustrations, and bewilderment will come to hear the minister who preaches with authority.": "Billy",
  "I preach a Gospel not of despair but of hope for the individual, hope for society, and hope for the world.": "Billy",
  "I am counting totally and completely on the Lord Jesus Christ, and not on Billy Graham. I am not going to heaven because I\u2019ve read the Bible, nor because I\u2019ve preached to a lot of people. I\u2019m going to heaven because of what Christ did.": "Billy",
  "I know that many of the things I have said from the Scriptures have offended some, but I cannot afford to tone down the message. As Paul said in 1 Corinthians 9:17, \u201cI have a stewardship entrusted to me\u201d (nasb), and that is to preach the pure and simple Gospel in whatever culture I am in.": "Billy",
  "Many churches have their eyes on the culture instead of on Christ. Many pastors preach on common unity instead of calling the community to repent.": "Billy",
  "When we preach or teach the Scriptures, we open the door for the Holy Spirit to do His work. God has not promised to bless oratory or clever preaching. He has promised to bless His Word.": "Billy",
  "I must ask myself, \u201cBilly Graham, are you prepared to meet the Master at any moment?\u201d Yes, I am\u2014but not because I have preached or tried to help people, but solely because I am trusting Christ as my Lord and Savior. Stop right now and ask yourself that question.": "Billy",
  "Effective preaching must be biblical preaching, whether it is the exposition of a single word in the Bible, a text, or a chapter. The Word is what the Spirit uses.": "Billy",
  "How marvelous it was to stand in a place like the Soviet Union and talk about the coming kingdom and to tell them that Communism will not win. I told them capitalism would not win either": "it\u2019s",
  "Double-mindedness means the faculty of holding two contradictory beliefs in one\u2019s mind and accepting both of them. We talk out of both corners of our mouths at once.": "Billy",
  "My visits to Hungary over the past twelve years absolutely fixed my conviction that God\u2019s Holy Spirit was releasing a spiritual force in that part of the world that was bound to challenge the atheistic philosophy that had dominated nations in that region for decades.": "Billy",
  "Only God knows when the alarm will sound, ending the work and ministry of evangelism as we have known it.": "Billy",
  "I\u2019ve never seen such a hunger in people for spiritual things . . .People realize the past is gone, the future is uncertain, and the present seems to be hopeless. As a result, many [in Moscow] were open to God.": "Billy",
  "My visit to Auschwitz will certainly be one of the most unforgettable events of my life. It is a blot on the whole human race. It was the invention of minds so depraved and demonic that they defy any rational explanation. It reminds us of the terrible potential man has for violence and inhumanity.": "Billy",
  "I wept more in Korea than in all the past several years put together. These experiences changed my life. I could never be quite the same again . . . I felt sadder, older. I felt as though I had gone in a boy and come out a man.": "Billy",
  "Nations and civilizations rise, flourish for a time, and then decay. Eventually each comes to an end. This, because of sin, is the decree of history and the way of life on this planet.": "Billy",

  "We should say nothing that we would not wish to say in His Presence. We should do nothing that we would not do in His Presence.": "Billy",
  "The Scripture warns about evil communications that corrupt good manners. Off-color jokes and dirty stories have no place in the Christian life. Thousands of people are engaging in immorality by the way they talk. Keep your talk pure. Ask God to purify your tongue.": "Billy",
  "You can use your tongue to slander, to gripe, to scold, to nag, and to quarrel; or you can bring it under the control of God\u2019s Spirit and make it an instrument of blessing and praise.": "Billy",
  "Cursing, telling smutty stories, smearing the good name of another, and referring irreverently to God and the Scriptures may be considered as coming under the expression corrupt speech. Our speech is to be clean, pure, and wholesome.": "Billy",
  "I have walked down jungle trails in Africa where I met fellow Christians; and immediately we were brothers even though we were separated by language, race, and culture.": "Billy",
  "We insult God by speaking to Him with our lips while our hearts are far from Him.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that a man who can control his tongue can control his whole personality.": "Billy",
  "God speaks to those who are prepared in their hearts to listen. Discern the voice from heaven above the noisy din of earth\u2019s confusion.": "Billy",
  "Suppose there was no anger, no profanity, no lying, no grumbling or complaining; suppose there were no dirty stories told, no unjust criticism\u2014what a different world this would be!": "Billy",

  "Worries flee before a spirit of gratitude.": "Billy",
  "Our worship must be directed to the One who holds the world in His hands.": "Billy",
  "We face a dark time in the history of God\u2019s people . . . the forces of evil seem to be gathering for a colossal assault on the work of God in the world. In the darkest hour God can still revive His people, and by the Holy Spirit breathe new vigor and power into the body of Christ.": "Billy",
  "The devil\u2019s overriding goal is to block God\u2019s work\u2014 and if he can convince you God doesn\u2019t really love you, or that you can\u2019t fully trust Him, then he has blocked God\u2019s work in your life and achieved his goal.": "Billy",
  "Do your work with honesty and integrity, and don\u2019t compromise God\u2019s moral standards. It may be difficult, but it\u2019s far better to do right than to do wrong. God is with you, and He will not abandon you.": "Billy",
  "Christians at work in the world are the only real spiritual light in the midst of great spiritual darkness. This places a tremendous responsibility on all of us.": "Billy",
  "Any work done by a follower of Christ to the glory of God is \u201cgold, silver, precious stones.\u201d But if any follower of Christ works with any self-interest or personal ambition involved, it will be \u201cwood, hay, and stubble\u201d and will be burned.": "Billy",
  "Worship in the truest sense takes place only when our full attention is on God\u2014on His glory, power, majesty, love and compassion.": "Billy",
  "Learn to shut out the distractions that keep you from truly worshiping God.": "Billy",
  "We have come to worship things, status, fame, popularity, money, security. Anything that comes between God and ourselves is idolatry. Jesus demands Lordship over all such things.": "Billy",
  "Many believe that pagan worship is a thing of the past, but it is ever present\u2014we have just given it a new name: pop culture.": "Billy",
  "The true child of God will have a hunger for worship and God\u2019s Word.": "Billy",
  "We are to till the soil and work the land\u2014not worship it.": "Billy",
  "God is more concerned about the attitude of our hearts than the way we express it. Worship isn\u2019t supposed to be entertainment.": "Billy",
  "Many people who have lost jobs . . . find that this was God\u2019s way of redirecting their lives.": "Billy",
  "Jesus used the carefree attitude of the birds to underscore the fact that worrying is unnatural. I am learning in my own life, day by day, to keep my mind centered on Christ.": "Billy",
  "As long as you look only at the situation in the world today, it will be very hard . . . to overcome your worries because it is true that there are many problems and the future is unknown to us. Lift your eyes beyond your circumstances and learn instead to trust God. Worrying . . . won\u2019t change anything.": "Billy",
  "Often our self-esteem is tied to our work. In our culture, men and women often define themselves by the jobs they hold . . . But a person\u2019s job tells you nothing about a person\u2019s character or value.": "Billy",
  "Man has always been beset by worry, and the pressures of modern life have aggravated the problem . . . Many . . . are filled with a thousand anxieties. Bring them to Jesus Christ by faith. He will bring peace to your soul and your mind.": "Billy",
  "Memorizing the Bible is most important. \u201cThinking God\u2019s thoughts\u201d will take the place of worried, anxious concerns.": "Billy",
  "Only the Holy Spirit can give us peace in the midst of the storms of restlessness and despair. We should not grieve our Guide by indulging in worry or paying undue attention to self.": "Billy",
  "Pray for wisdom to deal with whatever is worrying you. Pray that God will act to change the circumstances according to His will. He doesn\u2019t always do what we want Him to\u2014but He knows what\u2019s best for us, and He can be trusted.": "Billy",
  "Some people spend so much time worrying about what might happen that they never enjoy what is happening [now] . . . Today is the tomorrow you worried about yesterday.": "Billy",
  "Ask God to help you see the world the way He sees it.": "Billy",
  "One of the great joys of my life has been to travel around the world and meet thousands of Christians in every country.": "Billy",
  "We must warn the nations of the world that they must repent and turn to God while there is yet time. We must also proclaim that there is forgiveness and peace in knowing Jesus Christ as Savior and Lord.": "Billy",
  "I have stood in the places where history was made. I have seen with my own eyes the part that men and women of faith have played in these earthshaking events, and I have heard with my own ears their cries for freedom.": "Billy",
  "All over the world God is opening doors of opportunity, making it possible for us to take the Gospel to millions who have never heard of Christ.": "Billy",
  "The greatest tribute a boy can give to his father is to say, \u201cWhen I grow up, I want to be just like my dad.\u201d It is a convicting responsibility for us fathers and grandfathers.": "Billy",
  "In searching for ways to bridge the generation gap, there is no doubt that we, as parents, will have to practice what we preach, by striving more to bring our conduct into line with our code of beliefs.": "Billy",
  "If ever we needed to put the Golden Rule into action, it\u2019s with our aging parents.": "Billy",
  "Although the testimony of my mother\u2019s life helped mold me and taught me how to live, the testimony of her last years and her death gave me insight into how to die.": "Billy",
  "What a comfort it was for me to know that no matter where I was in the world, my mother was praying for me.": "Billy",
  "If God gives you responsibility for aging parents, seek what is best for them, not what is most convenient for you. And keep contact with them!": "Billy",
  "Parents have bought into the world\u2019s pastimes chock-full of pop culture, and it is searing the souls of our children. Parents have allowed electronic babysitters to infiltrate their homes and minds; young people\u2019s sense of right and wrong is being choked by wild and rank weeds in a moral wasteland.": "Billy",
  "Only God Himself fully appreciates the influence of a Christian mother in the molding of character in her children.": "Billy",
  "The influence of a mother upon the lives of her children cannot be measured. They know and absorb her example and attitudes when it comes to questions of honesty, temperance, kindness, and industry.": "Billy",
  "Many parents preach to their children but do not set good examples. Parents want the children to do as they say, not as they do.": "Billy",
  "Parenting is the most important responsibility most of us will ever face, and none of us does it perfectly.": "Billy",

  "Calloused hands were the badge of the pioneer, while furrowed brows are the insignia of modern man.": "Billy",
  "[Every] believer will receive a reward for his works. The New Testament teaches these rewards are called \u201ccrowns.\u201d We will surely be surprised to note who receives the crowns and who doesn\u2019t. The lowliest servant may sparkle with more jewels than the philanthropist who endowed the church and whose name is engraved on the plaque in the narthex.": "Billy",
  "Work isn\u2019t only earning a living": "work",
  "One of the Christian\u2019s responsibilities in following Christ is to have a new attitude toward work. So many young people want Christ without responsibility . . . whatever work a Christian does . . . he should do his best.": "Billy",
  "Think of working forever at something you love to do, for [the] one you love with all your heart, and never getting tired! We will never know weariness in heaven.": "Billy",
  "God did not intend for us to be idle and unproductive. There is dignity in work.": "Billy",
  "Both my parents had a great influence on me. I never heard my father use a profane or even a slang word. I always respected him because of his complete integrity. In his business dealings his handshake was like a contract. He was as good as his word. Of all the people I have ever known, my mother had the greatest influence on me.": "Billy",
  "Society has become so obsessed with sex that it seeps from all the pores of our national life.": "Billy",
  "In the face of legalized pornography, the conscience of America seems to be paralyzed. More serious than our fakery in art, literature, and pictures is the collapse of our moral standards and the blunting of our capacity as a nation for righteous indignation.": "Billy",
  "The word lust [can] mean \u201cselfish desire.\u201d . . .It is wanting something so badly you will do anything to get it. That is one of the tricks of the devil. It is too high a price to pay.": "Billy",
  "It is a source of encouragement that many homosexuals report being transformed through the power of the Gospel.": "Billy",
  "No matter how we may rationalize the practice [of homosexuality] . . . Romans 1 makes it clearly the product of a reprobate mind . . .I am not exonerating all heterosexual activity . . . When we come to Christ, we are called upon to repent of our sins and no longer to practice the ungodly patterns of living.": "Billy",
  "God has not changed. His laws have not changed. He is still a God of love and mercy But He is also a God of righteousness and judgment.": "Billy",
  "God is sending forth His message of love, but you must tune in. You must be willing to listen and to receive His message and then to obey it.": "Billy",
  "Don\u2019t make the mistake of thinking that because God is love everything is going to be sweet, beautiful, and happy and that no one will be punished for his sins . . . God\u2019s love provided the cross of Jesus, by which we can have forgiveness and cleansing.": "Billy",
  "A God of love must be a God of justice. It is because God loves that He is just. His justice balances His love and makes His acts of bothlove and justice meaningful.": "Billy",
  "God could not consistently love men if He did not provide for the judgment of evildoers.": "Billy",
  "[The] love of God that reaches to wherever man is, can be entirely rejected. God will not force Himself upon anyone against his will. It is your part to believe. It is your part to receive. Nobody else can do it for you.": "Billy",
  "God\u2019s love is unchangeable": "He",
  "God\u2019s love did not begin at the cross. It began in eternity before the world was established, before the time clock of civilization began to move.": "Billy",

  "[Christians] are commanded to love our neighbors, and the first step in doing this is to show a watching world that Christ reigns within us.": "Billy",
  "Agape love is selfless love . . . the love God wants us to have isn\u2019t just an emotion but a conscious act of the will\u2014a deliberate decision on our part to put others ahead of ourselves. This is the kind of love God has for us.": "Billy",
  "Until the Good News of Jesus Christ burst onto the human scene,the word love was understood mostly in terms of seeking one\u2019s own advantage. Loving the unlovely was incomprehensible A loving God reaching down to sinful humans was unthinkable.": "Billy",
  "Scripture makes it clear that our first love is always to be for our Lord.": "Billy",
  "When you truly love someone, you want to please and honor them by the way you act. How you treat someone shows whether or not you really care about them.": "Billy",

  "True love is an act of the will\u2014a conscious decision to do what is best for the other person instead of ourselves.": "Billy",
  "An unbelieving world may say otherwise, but so-called \u201csexual liberation\u201d is actually sexual slavery\u2014slavery to our own lusts.": "Billy",
  "Pornography is anything that depicts lewdness in such a way as to create impure thoughts and lusts. However, the sewers continue to flow, destroying the moral fabric of our society.": "Billy",
  "It has always been a mark of decaying civilizations to become obsessed with sex. When people lose their way, their purpose, their will, and their goals, as well as their faith . . . they go \u201ca whoring.\u201d It is a form of diversion that requires no thought, no character, and no restraint.": "Billy",
  "Why shouldn\u2019t we have laws forbidding pornography and obscenity? Many heroic leaders have tried, but they have stumbled over even the definition of the word \u201cobscenity.\u201d If we cannot agree on the length of a foot, it is because we have lost our yardstick.": "Billy",
  "[Satan] has hundreds of agents writing pornographic literature and producing sex movies to pollute [the mind]. He has intellectuals in high positions teaching a hedonistic and permissive philosophy . . .They lack an anchor for their real self.": "Billy",
  "We are going through a sexual tempest, a bombardment provided by unprecedented exploitation of cheap sex by moviemakers, theater owners, publishers, and producers of pornography. [There is more] openness of talk about sex, acceptance of public nudity . . . homosexuality. Sex revolution, no! But sex pollution? Yes!!": "Billy",
  "Sex-centered magazines litter our newsstands . . . each edition trying to escape new laws from the bottom of the sewers. We put lids on sewer holes. Ought we not to do something about the pornography which is spewing out a polluted river of filth which can destroy us faster than any chemical pollution we seem so worried about?7": "Billy",

  "Philosophically, war is an extension of man\u2019s struggle with sin and evil in the world.": "Billy",

  "You can trust Christ at this moment. The Bible says, \u201cNow is the accepted time\u201d [2 Corinthians 6:2 KJV]. Don\u2019t put it off. Don\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019ll think about it.\u201d Don\u2019t say, \u201cI\u2019ll do it tomorrow.\u201d Do it right now. At this moment, say yes to Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Allow the resurrected Christ to allocate your time as His own . . . and have complete right-of-way throughout your being.": "Billy",
  "If ever we are to study the Scriptures, if ever we are to spend time in prayer, if ever we are to win souls for Christ, if ever we are to invest our finances for His kingdom\u2014it must be now.": "Billy",
  "How can men boast that they control their own destiny when they cannot solve the problems of war?": "Billy",
  "Modern war is the most highly developed of all sciences. We have perfected our weapons but failed to perfect the men who use them.": "Billy",
  "The Charter of the United Nations said in its preamble: \u201cWe the people determined to save succeeding generations from war . . .\u201d Can the United Nations save the world from war? The answer is No! It was conceived and created by statesmen who knew little of the significance of the biblical concept of history and the nature of man. When the perspective is wrong, the whole viewpoint will be wrong.": "Billy",
  "The Garden of Eden was somewhere in present-day Iraq. The turmoil and war [we are witnessing] in that part of the world . . .is occurring in the land where God established the first perfect civilization.": "Billy",
  "If the human race would turn from its evil ways and return to God, putting behind its sins of disobedience, idolatry, pride, greed, and belligerence, and all the various aberrations that lead to war, the possibility of peace exists.": "Billy",
  "Scripture indicates that deception, false religions, and apostasy lead to war, and that war in turn leads to famine and pestilence.": "Billy",
  "We all have exactly the same number of minutes in a day. The question is, how will we use them? Most people today are either too busy\u2014or not busy enough. The Bible tells us that both extremes are wrong.": "Billy",
  "War is only one facet of the larger problem of evil which has been with the human race since the beginning . . .This same evil tried to destroy the greatest human being who ever lived, nailing Him to a cross.": "Billy",
  "What is your story? Be ready to share it when the Lord gives you the opportunity.": "Billy",
  "Be a good witness by the way you live. The way we live is often more convincing than the words we say.": "Billy",
  "One faithful witness is worth a thousand mute professors of religion . . . Our faith grows by expression . . . we must share it\u2014we must witness.": "Billy",
  "We witness in two ways: by life and by word . . . God\u2019s purpose . . , after we have been converted is that we be witnesses to His saving grace and power. We are to be commandoes for Christ. We are to be minute-men for Him.": "Billy",
  "When brothers and sisters in Christ unite in the common bond of the Word of God and prayer, they are strengthened in their faith and witness.": "Billy",
  "The Spirit goes ahead of us when we witness\u2014 preparing the way, giving us the words, and granting us courage.": "Billy",
  "The lukewarm Christian can accomplish nothing with a whole life in which to do it. If you have lived for sin and self . . . your witness will have [a] telling effect on all who have known you.": "Billy",
  "Christians ought to carry written in our hearts the solemn truth of how short is our opportunity to witness for Christ and live for Him.": "Billy",
  "While separation does not mean disengagement from the world, there are certain activities and places that God clearly wants us to avoid not only to protect ourselves from spiritual harm but so that the witness we have will not be tarnished.": "Billy",
  "The greatest way to witness is through the life you live. Let the radiance of your Christian life be such that it will make [others] ask questions about your [faith].": "Billy",
  "I am convinced the greatest act of love we can ever perform for people is to tell them about God\u2019s love for them in Christ.": "Billy",
  "When Christ\u2019s love fills our hearts, it puts selfishness on the run.": "Billy",
  "The mystery of God\u2019s love would not be a mystery if we knew all the answers.": "Billy",
  "I urge new converts to take plenty of time in Bible study and prayer before getting on a public platform to testify.": "Billy",
  "The unbelieving world should see our testimony lived out daily because it just may point them to the Savior.": "Billy",
  "We should not let a day go by without thanking God for His mercy and grace to us in Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "Thanksgiving is recognition of a debt that cannot be paid. We express thanks, whether or not we are able otherwise to reimburse the giver.": "Billy",
  "The greatest testimony to this dark world today would be a band of crucified and risen men and women, dead to sin and alive unto God, bearing in their bodies \u201cthe marks of the Lord Jesus\u201d [Galatians 6:17 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "The devil will try to discourage you, to divert you; he will seek to dilute your testimony; he will attempt anything to destroy your relationship to Christ and your influence upon others.": "Billy",
  "Our creativity, our inner sense of right and wrong, our ability to love and to reason\u2014all bear witness to the fact that God created us in His image. The Bible says God \u201chas not left himself without testimony\u201d [Acts 14:17 NIV].": "Billy",
  "No Christian has the right to go around wringing his hands, wondering what we are to do in the face of the present world situation. The Scripture says that in the midst of persecution, confusion, wars, and rumors of wars, we are to comfort one another with the knowledge that Jesus Christ is coming back in triumph, glory, and majesty.": "Billy",
  "Subtle persecution may happen to you in your office, school, or social gathering. You may not be \u201cwith it,\u201d or be \u201cone of the crowd.\u201d No suffering that the Christian endures for Christ is ever in vain.": "Billy",
  "If you take a stand [for God] and mean it, you may suffer persecution. Some of your friends will drift away. They don\u2019t want to be with people like you. You speak to their conscience. They feel uncomfortable in your presence because you live for God.": "Billy",
  "We can take persecution because we know the purpose behind it. The purpose is to glorify God.": "Billy",
  "While Christians in America have worshipped without the fear or threat of physical abuse for their beliefs, thousands of their brothers in Christ throughout the world have been tortured and martyred for confessing the name of Christ.": "Billy",
  "In a country where Christians were looked upon with suspicion and disfavor, a government leader said to me with a twinkle in his eye, \u201cChristians seem to thrive under persecution. Perhaps we should prosper them, and then they would disappear.": "Billy",
  "Throughout the world today there are people who are enduring cruelties and persecution because of their Christian faith. We must pray for them, and for ourselves, so that in our own dying hour God will give us grace to endure until the end, anticipating the certainty of His glory to come.": "Billy",
  "Persecution may wear an insulting face. Insults may come as a result of a Christian\u2019s lifestyle, which should be different from that of the secular world.": "Billy",
  "The Bible clearly says that faithfulness and persecution often go hand in hand.": "Billy",
  "A spirit of thankfulness is one of the most distinctive marks of a Christian whose heart is attuned to the Lord. Thank God in the midst of trials and every persecution.": "Billy",
  "Bearing our cross does not mean wearing gunny sacks and long faces. Some people . . . wear the look of a martyr every time they hear criticism. Sometimes we deserve the criticism we receive; however, we are blessed only when men speak evil against us falsely for Christ\u2019s sake.": "Billy",
  "When thanksgiving is filled with true meaning and is not just the formality of a polite \u201cthank you,\u201d it is the recognition of dependence.": "Billy",
  "We should not covet or expect the praise of ungodly men . . . the very fact that they are inclined to persecute us is proof that we are \u201cnot of the world.": "Billy",
  "Why should we give God thanks? Because everything we have comes from God.": "Billy",
  "Grumbling and gratitude are, for the child of God, in conflict. Be grateful and you won\u2019t grumble. Grumble and you won\u2019t be grateful.": "Billy",
  "As you think about the future . . . give thanks and trust God . . . Even when life may be difficult, we should thank God for all He does for us\u2014which we do not deserve.": "Billy",
  "It is not just becoming a Christian; it is also being a Christian all the time, 24 hours a day.": "Billy",
  "Time is running out. The seconds are ticking away toward midnight. The human race is about to take the fatal plunge . . . Is there any authority left? Is there a path we can follow? Can we find a code book that will give us the key to our dilemmas? We do have authoritative source material. It is found in the ancient and historic Book we call the Bible.": "Billy",
  "We are accountable to [God] for the way we use our time.": "Billy",

  "Heaven has no clocks or calendars, and time will be no more [Revelation 10:6].": "Billy",

  "The resurrection blasts apart the finality of death, providing an alternative to the stifling settling dust of death and opens the way to new life.": "Billy",
  "The most important events in human history were the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ.": "Billy",

  "Never forget that the resurrection of Christ is in many ways the central event of all history.": "Billy",
  "At the return of Christ the resurrection of believers will take place. It will take the unbelieving world by surprise.": "Billy",
  "Death has two stages, first the separation of the body from the spirit . . . for a purely spiritual existence, and second, reunion with the body and a glorious resurrection at the Second Coming of Christ.": "Billy",
  "The resurrection is our great hope.": "Billy",

  "The [twentieth century] could well go down in history not so much as a century of progress but as \u201cthe century of superficiality.": "Billy",
  "You cannot build a superstructure on a cracked foundation.": "Billy",
  "Christians are to be \u201cthe light of the world\u201d [Matthew 5:14], illuminating the darkness caused by sin and giving guidance to a world that has lost its way.": "Billy",
  "As Christians we have a responsibility toward the poor, the oppressed, the downtrodden, and the many innocent people around the world who are caught in wars, natural disasters, and situations beyond their control.": "Billy",
  "The Bible teaches that we have a Christian duty to help our neighbors in their time of need. We are called by God to bring the water of life for both soul and body. God created them both, and His purpose is to redeem them both.": "Billy",
  "May our gratitude find expression in our prayers and our service for others, and in our commitment to live wholly for Christ.": "Billy",
  "Be honest about your weaknesses and ask God to help you overcome them so you can serve Christ more effectively.": "Billy",
  "God wants to use you right where you are. Every day you probably come in contact with people who will never enter a church, or talk with a pastor, or open a Bible\u2014 and God wants to use you to point them to Christ. You may be the \u201cbridge\u201d God would use to bring them to Himself.": "Billy",
  "Oh God, if You want me to serve You, I will. I\u2019ll be what You want me to be. I\u2019ll go where You want me to go.": "Billy",
  "If we are going to touch the people of our communities, we too must know their sorrows, feel for them in their temptations, stand with them in their heartbreaks. Jesus Christ entered into the arena of our troubles, and He wept with them that wept and rejoiced with them that rejoiced.": "Billy",
  "Many Christians would prefer to hear \u201cWhat a great guy\u201d from the crowd rather than \u201cWell done, good and faithful servant\u201d from the Master [Matthew 25:23].": "Billy",
  "One of Satan\u2019s most effective ways of blocking God\u2019s work is to convince us God can\u2019t use us to make an impact for Christ. But it isn\u2019t true. All around you are people no one else will ever be able to reach with the Gospel.": "Billy",
  "Jesus, by example, tells us that every true leader should be a helper, a servant, or even a bondslave. This is a command, not a suggestion, and applies with special force to leaders.": "Billy",
  "The strain of Christian service can result in sickness . . . I have known Christian workers who have risked their lives and health in serving the Lord.": "Billy",
  "Thinking of and serving with others can be an antidote to negative and unhealthy introspection.": "Billy",
  "God never calls a person [into His service] without equipping him. I know that from experience.": "Billy",
  "Persecution is one of the natural consequences of living the Christian life. It is to the Christian what \u201cgrowing pains\u201d are to the growing child. No pain, no development. No suffering, no glory. No struggle, no victory. No persecution, no reward!": "Billy",
  "Every area of our lives is to be under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. And that means the searchlight of God\u2019s Word must penetrate every corner of our lives.": "Billy",
  "Popularity and adulation are far more dangerous for the Christian than persecution. It is easy when all goes smoothly to lose our sense of balance and perspective.": "Billy",
  "The world doesn\u2019t really have much respect for Christians who adopt its fashions and ideas. It is inclined to regard them with contempt\u2014to write them off either as cowards who are ashamed of their faith or as frauds whose profession is not sincere.": "Billy",
  "There must be no discrepancy between what we say and what we do, between our walk and our talk.": "Billy",

  "Make it your goal to become more like Christ by refusing to let sin have its way, and pursuing instead that which is pure and good in the sight of God.": "Billy",
  "We often seek to please ourselves first, instead of God. What is interesting is that when we seek to please God first, very often we discover that we end up far more pleased than we did when we put ourselves first.": "Billy",
  "I am engaged in spiritual warfare every day. I must never let down my guard\u2014I must keep armed.": "Billy",
  "Being\u201d is far more important than \u201cdoing.\u201d When we are what we should be inside, we will bring forth fruit.": "Billy",
  "Submission . . . involves getting rid of everything which hinders God\u2019s control over our lives.": "Billy",
  "Whatever is unlike Christ in conduct, speech, or disposition grieves the Spirit of grace.": "Billy",
  "To be Spirit-filled is to be controlled or dominated by the Spirit\u2019s presence and power.": "Billy",
  "The lives of many reflect the practices and standards of this present world . . . they are more interested in imitating the world system dominated by Satan than in imitating Christ.": "Billy",
  "When we come to the end of ourselves, we come to the beginning of God.": "Billy",
  "We have been told by God that if we sin against Him and break His commandments, He will bring judgment upon the world. It is my responsibility and my duty as a minister of the Gospel to [warn] people. This is the message I must deliver.": "Billy",
  "Denying the existence of God cannot make Him go away any more than denying the existence of the Internal Revenue Service can make the tax man vanish. Many people who imagine a god of their own choosing will be horrified when they stand before the true God of heaven.": "Billy",
  "Extremes should be avoided.": "Billy",
  "[Our] minds are molded in many different ways\u2014 often in ways we are not aware of at the time. I am convinced that many things\u2014the films we watch, the television we see, the music we listen to, the books we read\u2014have a great effect on us.": "Billy",
  "The more we yield to pressure, the more easily we will yield next time.": "Billy",
  "Delighting in the Lord alters the desires.": "Billy",
  "Confidentiality is the essence of being trusted.": "Billy",
  "Most of us know about God, but that is quite different from knowing God.": "Billy",
  "The wheels of [God\u2019s] mercy and justice move quietly and silently, but they do move.": "Billy",
  "God is not bound by a body, yet He is a Person. He feels, He thinks, He loves, He forgives, He sympathizes with the problems and sorrows that we face.": "Billy",
  "If God can be fully proved by the human mind, then He is no greater than the mind that proves Him.": "Billy",
  "God can be everywhere at once, heeding the prayers of all who call out in the name of Christ; performing the mighty miracles that keep the stars in their places, and the plants bursting up through the earth, and the fish swimming in the sea. There is no limit to God. There is no limit to His wisdom. There is no limit to His power. There is no limit to His love. There is no limit to His mercy.": "Billy",
  "Talk about God can become dreary and lackluster if God isn\u2019t in you. Church can become a drab thing and the Bible an irksome Book if the Holy Spirit does not illuminate your soul with His indwelling presence.": "Billy",
  "At this crucial point in world history, everyone should be seeking an answer to the question, \u201cWhat is God like?\u201d Everyone should ask it, and everyone should make very sure of the answer . . . The Bible says, \u201c. . . God has shown it to them\u201d [Romans 1:19 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "Nothing in our lives takes God by surprise.": "Billy",
  "God is not a bargaining God. You cannot barter with Him. You must do business with Him on His own terms.": "Billy",
  "If we read the Bible as carefully and as regularly as we read the daily papers, we would be as familiar with and as well informed about God as we are about our favorite player\u2019s batting average during baseball season!": "Billy",
  "We have a conception that God is a haphazard God with no set of rules of life and salvation. Ask the astronomer if God is a haphazard God. He will tell you that every star moves with precision in its celestial path.": "Billy",
  "If you have been trying to limit God\u2014stop it! Don\u2019t try to confine Him or His works to any single place or sphere. You wouldn\u2019t try to limit the ocean.": "Billy",
  "Getting to know God and being able to call on Him is the most important step in storing up for the storms.": "Billy",
  "God began by revelation to build a bridge between Himself and people.": "Billy",
  "To live the life of God we must have the nature of God.": "Billy",
  "Your yearning for God must supersede all other desires. It must be like a gnawing hunger and a burning thirst.": "Billy",
  "Remember that \u201cwhere God guides, He provides. Where He leads, He supplies all needs.": "Billy",
  "Has God designated any one person here on earth to speak with final authority about Him? No\u2014the one Man who could do that lived two thousand years ago, and we crucified Him!": "Billy",
  "God says that we can learn a great deal about Him just by observing nature. Because He has spoken through His universe, all men are without excuse for not believing in Him. This is why the Psalmist said: \u201cThe fool hath said in his heart, There is no God\u201d [Psalm 14:1 KJV].": "Billy",
  "If we have no mercy toward others, that is one proof that we have never experienced God\u2019s mercy.": "Billy",
  "If we believe in what God made and what God said, we will believe in the One whom God sent.": "Billy",
  "We must practice the Presence of God. Jesus said, \u201cLo, I am with you always\u201d [Matthew 28:20]. Remember, Christ is always near us.": "Billy",
  "There are those who say that all roads lead to God. But Jesus said, \u201cI am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me\u201d [John 14:6 KJV].": "Billy",
  "God holds every man accountable for his rejection of Christ.": "Billy",

  "Energy out of control is dangerous": "energy",
  "For centuries mankind has been on an incredible journey, taking him across every generation and through every conceivable experience in his search for God.": "Billy",
  "Many people say they do not fear death, but the process of dying. It\u2019s not the destination, but the trip that they dread.": "Billy",

  "Death for the Christian is the doorway to heaven\u2019s glory. Because of Christ\u2019s resurrection we can joyously say with Paul, \u201cWhere, O death, is your victory?\u201d [1 Corinthians 15:55 NIV].": "Billy",
  "Jesus Christ was the Master Realist when He urged men to prepare for death, which was certain to come. Do not worry, said the Lord Jesus, about the death of the body, but rather concern yourself with the eternal death of the soul.": "Billy",
  "Death is not the end of the road\u2014it is merely a gateway to eternal life beyond the grave.": "Billy",
  "For the Christian, death can be faced realistically and with victory, because he knows \u201cthat neither death nor life . . . shall be able to separate us from the love of God\u201d [Romans 8:38\u201339 NKJV].": "Billy",
  "Throughout our culture we have been led to the idea that we accept death as the end of life on earth . . .Time bound as we are and goal oriented to achievements in our lifetime, we find it strange to anticipate heaven.": "Billy",
  "Sooner or later, we are going to face death; should we be making preparations while we are living?": "Billy",
  "If people paid more attention to death, eternity, and judgment, there would be more holy living on earth.": "Billy",
  "Death is said in the Bible to be a coronation for the Christian.": "Billy",
  "It is strange that men will prepare for everything except death. We prepare for education. We prepare for business. We prepare for our careers. We prepare for marriage. We prepare for old age. We prepare for everything except the moment we are to die.": "Billy",
  "Death reduces all men to the same rank. It strips the rich of his millions and the poor man of his rags . . .Death knows no age limits, no partiality. It is a thing that all men fear.": "Billy",
  "One of the primary goals in life should be to prepare for death. Everything else should be secondary.": "Billy",
  "No matter how much you exercise, no matter how many vitamins or health foods you eat, no matter how low your cholesterol, you will still die\u2014someday. If you knew the moment and manner of your death in advance, would you order your life differently?": "Billy",
  "Death for [a Christian] is no accident. With God there are no accidents, no tragedies, and no catastrophes as far as His children are concerned.": "Billy",
  "When we all reach the end of our earthly journey, we will have just begun.": "Billy",
  "Though the Christian has no immunity from death and no claim to perpetual life on this planet, death is to him a friend rather than a foe, the beginning rather than the end, another step on the pathway to heaven rather than a leap into a dark unknown.": "Billy",
  "The word decease literally means \u201cexodus\u201d or \u201cgoing out.\u201d The imagery is that of the children of Israel leaving Egypt and their former life of bondage, slavery, and hardship for the Promised Land.

  "Cut out some of your \u201cimportant social engagements,\u201d and make your home the center of your social life. God will honor you, and your children will grow up to call you \u201cblessed\u201d [Proverbs 31:28].": "Billy",
  "In many homes and among so-called educated people\u2014it has become fashionable to joke about the Bible and to regard it more as a dust-catcher than as the living Word of God.": "Billy",
  "Many homes are on the rocks today because God has been left out of the domestic picture. With the clash of personalities in a domestic pattern, there must be an integrating force, and the living God is that Force!": "Billy",
  "If there were no heaven and no hell, I would still want to be a Christian because of what it does for our homes and our own families in this life.": "Billy",
  "With the breakdown of discipline in the home and with every source of amusement and instruction pouring poison into daily life, it is not to be wondered that the minds of people are ready to receive anything but the truth and that they are ready to believe lies and ultimately the lie.": "Billy",
  "The world is not a permanent home, it is only a temporary dwelling.": "Billy",
  "It is far easier to live an excellent life among your friends, when you are putting your best foot forward and are conscious of public opinion, than it is to live for Christ in your home.": "Billy",
  "The broken home has become the number one social problem of America, and could ultimately lead to the destruction of our civilization . . . it does not make screaming headlines; but, like termites, it is eating away at the heart and core of the American structure.": "Billy",
  "If you are a true Christian, you will not give way at home to bad temper, impatience, fault-finding, sarcasm, unkindness, suspicion, selfishness, or laziness.": "Billy",
  "How many homes are broken because of men and women who are unfaithful! God will not hold you guiltless! There is a day of reckoning. \u201cBe sure your sin will find you out\u201d (Numbers 32:23 ESV). They will find you out in your own family life here in your relationship with your mate": "they",
  "The home only fulfills its true purpose when it is God-controlled. Leave Jesus Christ out of your home and it loses its meaning. But take Christ into your heart and the life of your family, and He will transform your home.": "Billy",

  "In some ways, Christians are homeless. Our true home is waiting for us, prepared by the Lord Jesus Christ.": "Billy",
  "The Bible takes the word home with all of its tender associations and sacred memories, and applies it to the hereafter and tells us that heaven is home.": "Billy",
  "God does not want an apartment in our house. He claims our entire home from attic to cellar.": "Billy",
