  "We come together, we create our families, we chose our mates out of the desire to form a life together. Love takes many forms, wears many faces, but when it's real, when it touches your heart, you will know it and--with hope--embrace it. Love is stronger than hate, love is stronger than anger. Love is stronger than all artificial divisions that exist n our world.": "Yasmine",
  "Did you miss me?\u2019\u201cA little bit,\u201d she said with a shrug.\u201cYou have tears running down your cheeks,\u201d he said with a grin. \u201cI think you missed me more than a little.": "Robyn",
  "They say love is blind...but it isn't. Love is perfect sight. Love is the ability to see a person, I mean really see him-his strengths, his weaknesses, his flaws, all his past triumphs and mistakes-and view that person not as the world says you're supposed to see him, but as you see him-as that special someone you know you will always embrace, body and soul, no matter what anyone else says or thinks  I know I can't tell anyone what I've been through. I know they wouldn't understand. They don't see him the way that I see him. All they know is the legend, the darkness. They don't know the inner beauty, the warmth and the joy more intense than anything I ever thought was possible to experience. They don't know the truth behind the name. My angel. My only. Lucifer.": "Marlon",
  "He felt like home.": "JoAnne",
  "Alexander tilted his head and kissed her deeply on the lips. He let go of her hands, and she wrapped her arms around his neck, pressing herself against him. They kissed as if in a fever... they kissed as if the breath were leaving their bodies.": "Paullina",

  "Miss Bridgerton,\u201d he said, \u201cthe devil himself couldn\u2019t scare you.\u201dShe forced her eyes to meet his. \u201cThat\u2019s not a compliment, is it?\u201dHe lifted her hand to his lips, brushing a feather-light kiss across her knuckles. \u201cYou\u2019ll have to figure that out for yourself,\u201d he murmured.To all who observed, he was the soul of propriety, but Hyacinth caught the daring gleam in his eye, and she felt the breath leave her body as tingles of electricity rushed across her skin. Her lips parted, but she had nothing to say, not a single word. There was nothing but air, and even that seemed in short supply.And then he straightened as if nothing had happened and said, \u201cDo let me know what you decide.\u201dShe just stared at him.\u201cAbout the compliment,\u201d he added. \u201cI am sure you will wish to let me know how I feel about you.\u201dHer mouth fell open.He smiled. Broadly. \u201cSpeechless, even. I\u2019m to be commended.\u201d\u201cYou\u2014\u201d\u201cNo. No,\u201d he said, lifting one hand in the air and pointing toward her as if what he really wanted to do was place his finger on her lips and shush her. \u201cDon\u2019t ruin it.

  "Who did she know in Raleigh who took the time off to fix a house? Or read Whitman or Eliot, finding images in the mind, thoughts of the spirit? Or hunted dawn from the bow of a canoe? These weren't the things that drove society, but she felt they shouldn't be treated as unimportant. They made living worthwhile.": "Nicholas",

His eyes softened. \u201cI misspoke,\u201d he said in a steady voice. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t need me to make sure she has enough food or a place to live-that is my privilege, but she doesn\u2019t need me to do that. She doesn\u2019t need me to keep her safe or to make her a whole person. She doesn\u2019t need me to do anything except love her. Which I do.": "Patricia",
  "Bet you ten bucks we make it.\"What are the odds? she thought, and realized with sudden, blinding clarity that she wouldn't take the other side of that bet, that only a loser would bet against them. This is really it, she thought, amazed. This is really forever. I believe in this.\"Min?\" he said, and she kissed him, putting all her heart into it. \"No bet,\" she said against his mouth. \"Your odds are too good.\"\"Our odds are too good": "Jennifer",
  "Romance has been elegantly defined as the offspring of fiction and love.": "Benjamin",
  "I shan't mind if you don't,\" he agreed. \"But I'll not let you go, Prudence. Til not pester you, but know this: I will wait until you choose to listen to your heart.\"\"Pshaw.\" It was a feeble effort. She took a deep breath and tried again. \"Humbug! How can you presume to know my heart?\"He smiled a slow, devastating smile. \"You are my heart.\" He lifted her hand and kissed it. \"And our hearts beat in tune.

  "Wars fought over a face like this,\u201d he murmured like he was talking to himself, my heart stopped beating and his thumbs moved lightly across my cheeks. \u201cA man would work himself into the ground for it, go down to his knees to beg to keep it, endure torture to protect it, take a bullet for it,\u201d his eyes came to mine, \u201cpoison his brother to possess a face like this.": "Kristen",
  "She nodded, grabbed her purse out of the drawer and skedaddled, walking like she was on a catwalk, one foot in front of the other, her ass swaying under the skirt of her expensive, tailored suit.Bitch.

  "She shook off the self-recrimination. What-ifs and could-have-beens were not the way to move forward. She knew that from experience.": "Judi",
  "I\u2019m not a woman you bring home to Mother, pick out china patterns with, or Mary forefend, breed. I\u2019ve seen a chunk of the universe, true, but there\u2019s still so much more to see. I doubt I\u2019ll ever cure this wanderlust, and I\u2019m content with dedicating my life to failing to sate it...

  "Nellie grinned. \"I always wanted to go to Venice. It's supposed to be the romance capital of the world.\"\"Sweet,\" put in Dan. \"Too bad your date is an Egyptian Mau on a hunger strike.\"The au pair sighed. \"Better than an eleven-year-old with a big mouth.": "Gordon",

  "My house seems remarkably full of people,\" he observed. \"Is it possible we were expected.": "Georgette",
  "I'm not asking you for a second chance. I know better than that. But you've got no right to ask me to settle for sex then expect me to give up the one thing that's kept me going. I gave you up, now I'm taking what's left.\u201d\u201cYou didn't give me up,\u201d she tossed back. \u201cYou never wanted me.\u201d\u201cI never wanted anything the way I wanted you.

  "When I realized I was going to die, the only thing I could think about was you and what an idiot I\u2019d been for not telling you how I felt about you. I think I\u2019ve loved you from the moment you lifted that awful blindfold off my face. I opened my eyes, and there you were, the bravest, most beautiful woman I\u2019ve ever known. You set me free Natalie. In so many ways, you set me free.": "Pamela",
  "You'll walk with me out on the wire, cuz baby, I'm just a scared and lonely rider, but I gotta know how it feels... I want to know love is wild, babe, I want to know love is real.": "Bruce",

  "You don't want me to feel obligated? Well, I'm sorry, Lily. I am herebecause I feel obligated.\" He brought her hand to his chest, pressing herpalm flat against his rapidly thumping pulse. \"I'm obligated by my heart. It'sdecided you're essential to my existence, you see. And it's threatening to go out on labor strike if I don't make you mine this very day. So yes.

  "When you sit that way, you look kind of like a beach ball with a head,\u201d he continued. \u201cYour haircut is really, really bad, I\u2019m probably going to lose my job for helping you this way, and I\u2019m dying to fuck you.\u201d He glanced at her. \u201cThat honest enough for you?": "Suzanne",

It bothers me that I know I will be wrong.": "Gunnar",
  "His hands may have been the one to heal you, but it will be mine that awaken you.": "Charlotte",
  "Sorry,\u02ba she said, her face shining with joy when she saw me. \u02baShould have put a sock on the door. Didn\u02b9t realize things were getting hot and heavy.\u02ba\u02baNo avoiding it,\u02ba I said lightly, clasping Dimitri\u02b9s hand. \u02baThings are always hot with him around.\u02baDimitri looked scandalized. He\u02b9d never held back when we were in bed together, but his private nature wouldn\u02b9t let him even hint about such matters to others. It was mean, but I laughed and kissed his cheek.\u02baOh, this is going to be fun,\u02ba I said. \u02baNow that everything\u02b9s out in the open.\u02ba\u02baYeah,\u02ba he said. \u02baI got a pretty \u2018fun\u02b9 look from your father the other day.": "Richelle",
  "Foolishly romantic, yeah, sure, maybe: but she'd rather have dreams of Prince Charming than the reality of Mr. Wrong.": "Lisa",
  "The guy in bed with her was not Nathan. Which meant Elle was buck-naked and wantonly riding the wrong guy.": "Katee",
  "Sam\u2026\u201d\u201cWhat?\u201d she whispered.\u201cTell me what to do to fix it.\u201dShe shook her head and closed her eyes as though she couldn\u2019t bear to see him. \u201cYou can\u2019t fix it.\u201dHe had to. Failure here was not an option. \u201cLet me try.": "Kaylea",
  "I'm ending this.''No. Come on. It's not worth it.''You are,' he said fiercely, looking at her.'You're worth it.": "Rainbow",

  "Never sleep with a lady only once, especially in the case of an older lady.-'Rhett ": "Rowena",
  "Rough palms cradled my face while my fingers gripped the pillow on either side of his. Lips, teeth, tongue, mingled together. I ate him up and didn\u2019t let go until I had to come up for air.": "Priya",
  "Ah, well.\u201d He smiled-another one of those devastatingly intoxicating smiles that did unreasonable things to her body temperature and respiration.With a nod and a respectful, \u201cMa\u2019am,\u201d he left her in the middle of the room.Feeling like she\u2019d been hit by a tank.": "Cindy",
  "Just because lips have met doesn't mean hearts have joined. And just because two bodies are drawn to each other doesn't mean two people are right for each other. A physical relationship does not equal love.": "Joshua",
  "You'll want all your strength for the wedding night.\" I cannot think why I should need strength,\" she said, ignoring a host of spine-tingling images rising in her mind's eye. \"All I have to do is lie there.\" \"Naked,\" he said grimly. \"Truly?\" She shot him a glance from under her lashes. \"Well, if I must, I must, for you have the advantage of experience in these matters. Still, I do wish you'd told me sooner. I should not have put the modiste to so much trouble about the negligee.\" \"The what?\" \"It was ghastly expensive,\" she said, \"but the silk is as fine as gossamer, and the eyelet work about the neckline is exquisite. Aunt Louisa was horrified. She said only Cyprians wear such things, and it leaves nothing to the imagination.\" Jessica heard him suck in his breath, felt the muscular thigh tense against hers. \"But if it were left to Aunt Louisa,\" she went on,\"I should be covered from my chin to my toes in thick cotton ruffled with monstrosities with little bows and rosebuds. Which is absurd, when an evening gown reveals far more, not to mention--\" \"What color?\" he asked. His low voice had roughened. \"Wine red,\" she said, \"With narrow black ribbons threaded through the neckline. Here.\" She traced a plunging U over her bosom. \"And there's the loveliest openwork over my...well, here.\" She drew her finger over the curve of her breast a bare inch above the nipple. \"And openwork on the right side of the skirt. From here\" --she pointed to her hip--\"down to the hem. And I bought---\" \"Jess.\" Her name was a strangled whisper. \"--slippers to match,\" she continued.\" Black mules with--\" \"Jess.\" In one furious flurry of motion he threw down the reins and hauled her into his lap.": "Loretta",
  "People loved you in the way they knew how - and often it was not the way you knew. Or needed.": "Josh",
  "What if I shave?\" he said. \"I look much better when I'm shaved. My cousin will vouch for that\u2014do I not look almost handsome when I shave, Edward? \" He didn't wait for the duke's reply but turned earnestly back to Prudence. \"Do you think you could marry me if I shaved?": "Anne",
  "We've been wed more than a month. Since it appears you mean to stay, I might as well give you leave to call me by my christian name. It is preferable, at any rate, to 'clodpole.": "Loretta",
  "He was too gorgeous for words and worst yet he knew it.": "Shannon",
  "This principle - that your spouse should be capable of becoming your best friend - is a game changer when you address the question of compatibility in a prospective spouse. If you think of marriage largely in terms of erotic love, then compatibility means sexual chemistry and appeal. If you think of marriage largely as a way to move into the kind of social status in life you desire, then compatibility means being part of the desired social class, and perhaps common tastes and aspirations for lifestyle. The problem with these factors is that they are not durable. Physical attractiveness will wane, no matter how hard you work to delay its departure. And socio-economic status unfortunately can change almost overnight. When people think they have found compatibility based on these things, they often make the painful discovery that they have built their relationship on unstable ground. A woman 'lets herself go' or a man loses his job, and the compatibility foundation falls apart.": "Timothy",
  "This has to be the most self-centered thing I've ever said, but no, I think you just wanted to vex me.": "Julia",
  "If you try to find a replacement, you'll be sadly disappointed, I can't be replaced. I'm the only man in all the world who possesses the right combination of qualities for you.You can turn your Ballister stare upon me all you like, but you can't petrify me. You can knock me about to your heart's content without worrying about doing any damage. You can perpetrate any sort of outrage your wicked mind conceives and be sure I'll join in, with a will. You're a troublemaker, Lydia. A Ballister devil. Nothing less than a Mallory hellion would ever suit you.\"- Vere Mallory -": "Loretta",
  "Would you like to hear more romance of the evening? He told me that the Guard should be reduced by half, and I threw an ink jar at his head.\"\"Is that when he cried?\"\"He ducked,\" Attolia said dryly.Grown more confident of the queen's humor, Relius said, \"I had not pictured you for a fishwife.\"\"Lo, the transforming power of love.": "Megan",
  "I could have screamed, but I didn't. I could have fought, but I didn't. I just lay there and let it happen, wathcing the winter-white sky go gray above me. One wolf prodded his nose into my hand and agianst my cheek, casting a shadow along my face. His yellow eyes looked into mine as the other wolves moved me this way and that. I held onto those eyes for as long as I could. Yellow. And, up close, flecked brillantly with every shade of gold and hazel. I didn't want him to look away, and he didn't. I wanted to reach out and grab a hold of his ruff, but my hands stayed curled to my chest, my arms frozen to my body. I couldn't remember what it felt like to be warm. Then he was gone, without him, the other wolves closed in, too close, sufficating. Something seemed too flutter in my chest. There was no sun; there was no light. I was dying. I couldn't remember what the sky looked like. But I didn't die, I was lost in a sea of cold, and then I was reborn into a sea of warmth. I remember this: his yellow eyes. I thought I would never see them again.": "Maggie",
  "V had a passing thought that she used the word \"anyway\" like an eraser on a crowded chalkboard. She said it whenever she needed to clear off the things she'd just shared to make room for more.": "J.R.",
  "He grinned, and right then it occurred to him that he hadn't enjoyed himself so much with a woman in a very long time. If Annabelle Granger were a few inches taller, a hell of a lot more sophisticated, better organized, less bossy, and more inclined to worship at his feet, she'd have made a perfect wife.": "Susan",
  "She has to agree to have me. It could take some time, but I\u2019m confident I can trick her into it.": "Robyn",
  "He gripped her nape. \"I fuckin' love you, Regin!\" Rain spiked his lashes as he gazed down at her, commanding her, \"Love Me Back": "Gena",
  "Oh, Cameron,\" Eldon replied in a whisper, moving closer and brushing his lips over Cameron's mouth. \"You are literally the very reason my heart beats. Nothing I have lost can compare with the love in you I have found.": "Zathyn",
  "As a rule of thumb, I'd say one clich\u00e9 per [Romance]--and then be damn sure you can make it work. But if you're going to try to write the virginal amnesiac twin disguised as a boy mistaken for the mother (or father depending how well the disguise works) of a secret baby, honey, you better have some serious skills. Or seek therapy.": "Nora",
  "I\u2019m going to carry you now,\u201d he told her, \u201cso we can move even faster. I\u2019m not asking you, I\u2019m telling you. Any response from you is unnecessary and unwelcome.": "Suzanne",
  "Excuse me?\" I said, palms down on the Formica tabletop. \"Coffee? I thought we came here for pie.\" \"I don't eat the kind of pie they serve here.\" I felt a flash of heat go through my stomach. I knew firsthand the kind of pie Ranger liked.": "Janet",

  "If she were here I wouldn't be able to keep my hands off her. I would hold her so close she'd beg me to let her breathe. I'd kiss her so hard she'd plead for mercy.

Her heart gave a quick, queer little beat. But the bitterness of her old grievance promptly stiffened up her wavering determination. That scene of two years before flashed back into her recollection as vividly as if it had taken place yesterday. Gilbert had called her \u201ccarrots\u201d and had brought about her disdain before the whole school.

When Jace moved fast, his individual movements were almost invisible. She saw his hand go to his belt, and then something flashed in the air. She heard the sound of parting fabric as the cord above her head was sheared through. Released, she fell freely, too surprised to scream- directly into Jace's arms. The force knocked him backward, and they sprawled together onto one of the padded floor mats, Clary on top of him. He grinned up at her.\"Now,\" he said, \"that was much better. You didn't scream at all.\"\"I didn't get the chance.\" She was breathless, and not just from the impact of the fall.

Women are beginning to demand that Marriage shall mean Friendship as well as Passion; that a comrade-like Equality shall be included in the word Love; and it is recognised that from the one extreme of a 'Platonic' friendship (generally between persons of the same sex) up to the other extreme of passionate love (generally between persons of opposite sex) no hard and fast line can at any point be drawn effectively separating the different kinds of attachment.

  "When it comes to sexuality, romantic love plays a large part in feminine sexual scripts. Research suggests that women make sense of sexual encounters in terms of the amount of intimacy experienced; love becomes a rationale for sex. If i am in love, women often reason, sex is okay. Men more easily accept sex for its own sake, with no emotional strings necessarily attached. In this way, sexual scripts for men have involved more of an instrumental (sex for its own sake) approach, whereas for women it tends to be more expressive (sex involving emotional attachments). There is evidence to suggest that women are moving in the direction of sex as an end in itself without the normative constraints of an emotional relationship. By and large, however, women are still more likely than men to engage in sex as an act of love. Many scholars suggest that romance is one of the key ways that sexism is maintained in society.": "Susan",

But no, the world is upside down as far as I can see, and romances and their writers are ridiculed, hisses and generally spat upon. For what reason? One of my favorites is that women who read them might get mixed up about reality and imagine a man is going to rescue them from Life. According to this theory, women are so stupid that they can't tell a story from reality. Is anyone worried that the MEN who read spy thrillers are going to go after their neighbors with an automatic weapon? No, I don't remember anyone thinking that. Nor do I remember anyone worrying about murder mysteries or science fiction. It just seems to be dumb ol' women who might think some gorgeous, thoughtful, giving hunk is going to rescue them.

Val\u2019s legs followed, in powder-blue stockings and saxe-blue shoes, under the limp hem of a cr\u00eapey mustard-coloured dress, printed with blue moony flowers.

It sounded like Valerie was telling her about him.\u201d \u201cYeah, what did you hear?\u201dAngel looked up trying to remember. Something seemed to come to him but he hesitated. \u201cI don\u2019t think you wanna hear it, Alex. I know I wouldn\u2019t.\u201dAlex squeezed the doorway with his hand. What the hell could he have heard? \u201cTell me.\u201d Angel shook his head and looked back at the monitor. \u201cOnly reason I caught my attentions was because I overheard Sarah ask her something about wearing lingerie.\u201dAlex felt the hair on the back of his neck rise and his gut tightened. He banged his fist against the doorway. He didn\u2019t need to hear any more. Angel had been right that\u2019s the last thing he needed right now.

Only thine eyes remained.They would not go- they never yet have gone.Lighting my lonely pathway home that night,They have not left me (as my hopes have) since.They follow me- they lead me through the years.They are my ministers- yet I thier slaveThier office is to illumine and enkindle-My duty, to be saved by thier bright light,And purified in thier electric fire,And sanctified in thier Elysian fire.They fill my soul with Beauty (which is Hope),And are far up in heaven- the stars I kneel toIn the sad, silent watches of my night;While even in the meridian glare of dayI see them still- two sweetly scintillantVenuses, unextinguished by the sun!": "Edgar",

Her stench had gotten worse overnight, probably from the dampness. Another night like the last one, and he might snap and dunk her into that river just to clear the air.She saw him looking. Dark eyes regarded him with slight scorn.William leaned forward and pointed at the river. \u201cI don\u2019t know why you rolled in spaghetti sauce,\u201d he said in a confidential voice. \u201cI don\u2019t really care. But that water over there won\u2019t hurt you. Try washing it off.\u201dShe stuck her tongue out.\u201cMaybe after you\u2019re clean,\u201d he said.Her eyes widened. She stared at him for a long moment. A little crazy spark lit up in her dark irises. She raised her finger, licked it, and rubbed some dirt off her forehead.Now what?The girl showed him her stained finger and reached toward him slowly, aiming for his face.\u201cNo,\u201d William said. \u201cBad hobo.\u201dThe finger kept coming closer.": "Ilona",
  "For a long moment, he held her gaze without speaking, simply letting the impact of words sink in, before adding rapidly, as though he wished to get it over with as quickly as possible, \"I won't deny that you're beautiful. No mirror could tell you otherwise. But there are beautiful women for the buying in any brothel in London. Oh yes, and the ballrooms, too, if one has the proper price. It wasn't your appearance that caught me. It was the way you put me down in the gallery at Sibley Court.\" Vaughn's lips curved in a reminiscent smile. \"And the way you tried to bargain with me after.\" bargained,\" Mary corrected.\"That,\" replied Lord Vaughn, \"is exactly what I mean. Has anyone ever told you that you haggle divinely? That the simple beauty of your self-interest is enough to bring a man to his knees?\"Mary couldn't in honesty say that anyone had.Vaughn's eyes were as hard and bright as silver coins. \"Those are the reasons I want you. I want you for your cunning mind and your hard heart, for your indomitable spirit and your scheming soul, for they're more honest by far than any of the so-called virtues.\"\"The truest poetry is the most feigning?\" Mary quoted back his own words to him.\"And the most feigning is the most true.": "Lauren",

  "I don't know who had the training of you,\" he continued doggedly, \"but your morals are shocking. You spent a night in my bed, remember, after a night in a bawdy house. You go about collecting street urchins and letting inebriated vagabonds kiss you, and then you get into brawls in pawnshops. You are probably past all redemption, but I'm going to reform you anyhow.

  "Once she called to invite me to a concert of Liszt piano concertos. The soloist was a famous South American pianist. I cleared my schedule and went with her to the concert hall at Ueno Park. The performance was brilliant. The soloist's technique was outstanding, the music both delicate and deep, and the pianist's heated emotions were there for all to feel. Still, even with my eyes closed, the music didn't sweep me away. A thin curtain stood between myself and pianist, and no matter how much I might try, I couldn't get to the other side. When I told Shimamoto this after the concert, she agreed.\"But what was wrong with the performance?\" she asked. \"I thought it was wonderful.\"\"Don't you remember?\" I said. \"The record we used to listen to, at the end of the second movement there was this tiny scratch you could hear. Putchi! Putchi! Somehow, without that scratch, I can't get into the music!\"Shimamoto laughed. \"I wouldn't exactly call that art appreciation.\"\"This has nothing to do with art. Let a bald vulture eat that up, for all I care. I don't care what anybody says; I like that scratch!\"\"Maybe you're right,\" she admitted. \"But what's this about a bald vulture? Regular vultures I know about--they eat corpses. But bald vultures?\"In the train on the way home, I explained the difference in great detail.The difference in where they are born, their call, their mating periods. \"The bald vulture lives by devouring art. The regular vulture lives by devouring the corpses of unknown people. They're completely different.\"\"You're a strange one!\" She laughed.

  "I hate to tell you, dragon, but that's an integral part of the whole usiness,\" he whispered. \"If you're afraid to touch me then we're not going to get very far.\"She lifted her head to look at him. \"I thought I could lie back and let you ravish me,\" she said with complete honesty.He shook his head, the smile hovering around his lips, his eyes intent. \"This is a cooperative effort, my love.

It's extremely vexing.\"\"You're quite right on that count,\" he said sullenly. \"I'm damned vexed. I'd like to vex you right here on the floor, in fact.

Do you comprehend me?\" He took a reckless stride toward her and caught her chin between his fingers. \"I'm not your friend, my lady. I'm your lover.": "Laura",

Don't you wish we could still walk around in cloaks and boots and breeches, with leather doublets and flowing white dueling shirts and swords strapped around our waists? Of course, if we did, given the way things are today, there'd be people out there lobbying for sword control, and we'd need a National Sword Association and bumper stickers that would read \"Swords don't kill people, knights kill people,\" and there would be a five-day waiting period and background check before you could buy a rapier. We'd have drive-by lungings and people would be afraid of children carrying broadswords to school. \"Milady\" would be regard as a sexist term and feminists would go absolutely berserk if any woman called a man \"Milord.\" Ralph Nader would probably get quarter horses banned because they are too small and unsafe in a collision and someone would figure out a way to put seat belts and air bags on our saddles.

  "No!\" he cried and his face pinched with frustration and pain. \"I don't want to hear more reasons why we shouldn't be together. No more confessions to explain why you want to run away from what we share.\" \"Julian,\" she attempted to interrupt again, but he held up a trembling hand.His dark gaze held hers. \"I have moved heaven and earth to bring you back to me. I refuse to let you leave again. You are mine and you shall be mine for the rest of my life. Not as my mistress, but as my wife. And if you don't say yes, I shall be forced to drag you into Hyde Park and make love to you in plain view of everyone.

She panicked, as anyone might have when disparate parts of her life were about to crash into each other, certain to leave a path of anguish and debris. It was true that devotion could be lost as quickly as it was found, which was why some people insisted that love letters be written in ink. How easy it was for even the sweetest words to evaporate, only to be rewritten as impulse and infatuation might dictate. How unfortunate that love could not be taught or trained, like a seal or a dog. Instead it was a wolf on the prowl, with a mind of its own, and it made its own way, undeterred by the damage done. Love like this could turn honest people into liars and cheats, as it now did\u2026": "Alice",

I wanted to be loved by someone like my tough judicious mother and I wanted to run screaming through the headlights with a bottle in my hand. That was the family curse. We tended to nurse flocks of undisciplined wishes that collided and canceled each other out. The curse implied that if we didn't learn to train our desires in one direction or another we were likely to end up with nothing. Look at my father and mother today.I married in my early twenties. When that went to pieces I loved a woman. At both of those times and at other times, too, I believed I had focused my impulses and embarked on a long victory over my own confusion. Now, in my late thirties, I knew less than ever about what I wanted. In place of youth's belief in change I had begun to feel a nervous embarrassment that ticked inside me like a clock.

Don't leave me here in the dark.\"\"You are not in the dark,\" I said patiently. \"Look, I have left the candle ...\"But I knew, as I looked at him, that it would have made no difference if I had left him fifty candles. The darkness he feared was in his own mind and there was no light in the universe powerful enough to take that darkness from him.With a sigh of resignation I sat back on the bed and began to sing softly; and before I had finished the first verse, he was asleep.The bandages on his hands and wrists showed white and eerie in the candle-light, as I eased my skirts from his grasp.I knew that Marie was right.Physically and mentally, I had scarred him for life.": "Susan",

  "Yes. Kissing. Overrated.\"\"I could change your mind,\" Zach said, surprising the hell out of them both. Why would he take something as simple as this banter as a challenge? \"I don't know that I want to, but I feel right sure I could.\"\"How arrogant. How typically male.\"\"I suppose.\" He shrugged and reached for the wine bottle. \"More?\"She nodded, frowning now. \"How do you know you could change my mind? It's been a long time since you... well\u2014\"\"Over two years.\" The pain was there, an ache in his chest he imagined he would feel every time he thought of Hannah.And he thought of her every day.

  "A punching bag. The guy was pounding on a punching bag.

  "Relationships are physics. Time transforms things- it has to, because the change from me to we means clearing away the fortifications you'r put up around your old personality. Living with Susannah made me feel as if I started riding Einstein's famous theoretical bus. Here's my understanding of that difficult idea, nutshelled: if you're riding a magic Greyhound, equipped for light-speed travel, you'll actually live though less time than will any pedestrians whom the bus passes by. So, for a neighbor on the street with a stopwatch, the superfast bus will take two hours to travel from Point A to Point B. But where you're on that Greyhound, and looking at the wipe of the world out those rhomboidial coach windows, the same trip will take just under twenty-four minutes. Your neighbor, stopwatch under thumb, will have aged eighty-six percent more than you have. It's hard to fathom. But I think it's exactly what adult relationships do to us: on the outside, years pass, lives change. But inside, it's just a day that repeats. You and your partner age at the same clip; it seems not time has gone by. Only when you look up from your relationship- when you step off the bus, feel the ground under your shoes- do you sense the sly, soft absurdity of romance physics.": "Darin",

  "Is it love to worship a saint in heaven, whom you dare not touch, who hovers above you like a cloud, which floats away from you even as you gaze? To love is to feel one being in the world at one with us, our equal in sin as well as in virtue. To love, for us men, is to clasp one woman with our arms, feeling that she lives and breathes just as we do, suffers as we do, thinks with us, loves with us, and, above all, sins with us. Your mock saint who stands in a niche is not a woman if she have not suffered, still less a woman if she have not sinned. Fall at the feet of your idol an you wish, but drag her down to your level after that- the only level she should ever reach, that of your heart.": "Emmuska",

It doesn't matter what secrets swirl and bob in the waters beneath you, as you float toward that lady at Delphi, who, you imagined, reading Mythology, must have been beautiful. It doesn't matter that Charybdis, with no body, with no form, with only a mouth-as-being, couldn't have been evil, because she lacked the brain for it. It doesn't matter that following the logical course of events, the natural course, always disadvantages someone else, because love, after all, is simply a competition for resources, made infinitely complex and unknowable when squared and cubed and raised to every other emotional exponent - and then layered with sex and society and a bad memory for what those resources were in the first place.": "Darin",

In the churning seas, below the waves, together inside our hammock woven in coarse sailcloth by Unguentine's deft hands, a spherical webbed sack which hung and swivelled between the two walls of our bedroom, we would spin round and round with lapping tongues and the soft suction of lips, whirling, our amorous centrifuge, all night long, zipped inside against the elements.

It must have felt that way when Forster came of sexual age in the last years of the 19th century: seriously risky and dangerously blurt-able.

Doesn't the word 'loss' imply that we are better off before? I abhor the idea that we become women only through the physical act of a man.

She needed to force out an explanation or denial, but no words could get past her lips. Jemeryl's presence was paralysing her, an effect far more irresistible than anything Yenneg had achieved.Tevi watched Jemeryl take another few steps forwards and then crouch down so that their eyes were no more than a foot apart. Tevi thought she would die from the shock. Yet somehow, she forced her mouth to shape the words, \"Wine. Love potion.\"Her voice was not loud enough even to count as a whisper. Certainly nobody else in the room would have heard, yet Tevi could not control her breathing to manage anything else.At first Jemeryl showed no sign of comprehension, but then suddenly, the bewilderment on her face transformed into fury. She leapt up, her arms moving in a blurred aggressive swirl. The gesture ended with an action like hurling a ball. Blue fire erupted from Jemeryl's hands and shot towards Yenneg.The other sorcerer had obviously recognised the gesture and made an effort to protect himself. A shimmering shield sprung up before Yenneg, but it was not strong enough, and the shockwave knocked him off his feet. His shoulders slammed into the wall behind him and he crumpled to the floor. Jemeryl had been telling the truth when she claimed to vastly excel the acolytes in magical ability, not that Tevi had ever entertained doubts. Jemeryl's hands moved again, and this time Yenneg was sprawled on the floor and in no state to mount a defence. A second bolt of blue fire burst in his direction.Lightning in the form of a whip snapped across the room, intercepting Jemeryl's attack before it struck. The diverted fireball hit the wall of the summerhouse two feet from Yenneg's head and smashed through it, as if it were a stone going through wet paper.": "Jane",

  "After a time I saw what I believed, at the time, to be a radio relay station located out on a desolate sand spit near Villa Bens. It was only later that I found out that it was Castelo de Tarfaya, a small fortification on the North African coast. Tarfaya was occupied by the British in 1882, when they established a trading post, called Casa del Mar. It is now considered the Southern part of Morocco. In the early \u201820s, the French pioneering aviation company, A\u00e9ropostale, built a landing strip in this desert, for its mail delivery service. By 1925 their route was extended to Dakar, where the mail was transferred onto steam ships bound for Brazil. A monument now stands in Tarfaya, to honor the air carrier and its pilots as well as the French aviator and author Antoine Marie Jean-Baptiste Roger, comte de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry better known as Antoine de Saint-Exup\u00e9ry. As a newly acclaimed author in the literary world. \u201cNight Flight,\u201d or \u201cVol de nuit,\u201d was the first of Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s literary works and won him the prix Femina, a French literary prize created in 1904. The novel was based on his experiences as an early mail pilot and the director of the \u201cAeroposta Argentina airline,\u201d in South America. Antoine is also known for his narrative \u201cThe Little Prince\u201d and his aviation writings, including the lyrical 1939 \u201cWind, Sand and Stars\u201d which is Saint-Exup\u00e9ry\u2019s 1939, memoir of his experiences as a postal pilot. It tells how on the week following Christmas in 1935, he and his mechanic amazingly survived a crash in the Sahara desert. The two men suffered dehydration in the extreme desert heat before a local Bedouin, riding his camel, discovered them \u201cjust in the nick of time,\u201d to save their lives. His biographies divulge numerous affairs, most notably with the Frenchwoman H\u00e9l\u00e8ne de Vog\u00fc\u00e9, known as \u201cNelly\u201d and referred to as \u201cMadame de B.": "Captain",

Her shoulders tense at my gasp, when she realizes she\u2019s no longer alone. \u201cHello, beautiful,\u201d my voice husky. I drop my bags by the door and swiftly cross the room. I only have a split second to take in how devastating she looks in her blue gown. I don\u2019t know who moves first, but she\u2019s in my arms as my lips descend on hers.

A real thing. I imagine he tastes like honesty.": "Julie",
  "we match,\u201d I say, and as soon as the words are out I already know that tomorrow will come and I will remember this moment and wince. We match?? And so, even through this drunken haze, I feel relief when he doesn\u2019t laugh at me. Instead he squeezes me a little tighter, brings me a tiny bit closer so my edges are against his edges, and it\u2019s all warm. Our bodies fit. I secretly sniff him, and get rewarded with his fresh lemony scent": "Julie",
  "I am kissing David Drucker. I am kissing David Drucker. I am kissing David Drucker. I Was wrong. I had assumed this would be his first kiss, that it would be fumbling and a bit messy but still fun. No way. Can\u2019t be. This guy knows exactly what he\u2019s doing. How to cradle the back of my head with his hands. How to move in soft and slow, and then pick up the pace, and then slow down again. How to brush my cheeks with even smaller kisses, how to work his way down my jaw, and to soften the worry spot in the center of my brow. How to pause and look into my eyes, really look, so tenderly I feel it all the way down in my stomach. He even traces the small zigzag scar on my eyebrow with his fingertips, like it\u2019s something beautiful. I could kiss him forever. I\u2019m going to kiss him forever.": "Julie",
  "We don\u2019t talk on the ride home. We don\u2019t have to. I feel warm and giddy and like I have a secret that I want to keep all to myself. David Drucker, who is so many different people all at once: the guy who always sits alone, the guy who talked quantum physics even in my dad\u2019s dental chair, the guy who held my hand in the snow.

  "Will you think about the kissing?\u201d he asks, and I laugh again and mimic his shrug. If only he knew how much I think about the kissing. \u201cWill you reconsider hand-holding?\u201d he asks, instead of answering, I move my arm so it\u2019s next to his, so we are lined up, seam to seam. He reaches out his pinky finger and links it around mine and a warm, delicious chill makes its way up my arm. We stay that way for a minute, in a pinky swear, which feels like the smallest of promises. And then I grab his whole hand and link his fingers in mine. A slightly bigger promise. Or maybe a demand: Please be part of my tribe. It\u2019s pretty simple, really. For once, things are not complicated. Right now, right here, it\u2019s just us, together, like this. Palm to palm.

It was originally propagated by the sword, and ever since, its votaries have been subject, above the people of all other creeds, to this form of madness. In a moment the fruits of patient toil, the prospects of material prosperity, the fear of death itself, are flung aside. The more emotional Pathans are powerless to resist. All rational considerations are forgotten. Seizing their weapons, they become Ghazis\u2014as dangerous and as sensible as mad dogs: fit only to be treated as such. While the more generous spirits among the tribesmen become convulsed in an ecstasy of religious bloodthirstiness, poorer and more material souls derive additional impulses from the influence of others, the hopes of plunder and the joy of fighting. Thus whole nations are roused to arms. Thus the Turks repel their enemies, the Arabs of the Soudan break the British squares, and the rising on the Indian frontier spreads far and wide. In each case civilisation is confronted with militant Mahommedanism. The forces of progress clash with those of reaction.

If none of my earthly pleasures satisfy it, that does not prove that the universe is a fraud. Probably earthly pleasures were never meant to satisfy it, but only to arouse it, to suggest the real thing. If that is so, I must take care, on the one hand, never to despise, or to be unthankful for, these earthly blessings, and on the other, never to mistake them for the something else of which they are only a kind of copy, or echo, or mirage. I must keep alive in myself the desire for my true country, which I shall not find till after death; I must never let it get snowed under or turned aside; I must make it the main object of life to press on to that country and to help others to do the same.": "C.S.",

Harry heard the high voice shriek as he too yelled his best hope to the heavens, pointing Draco's wand:\"Avada Kedavra!\"\"Expelliarmus!\"The bang was like a cannon blast, and the golden flames that erupted between them, at the dead center of the circle they had been treading, marked the point where the spells collided. Harry saw Voldemort's green jet meet his own spell, saw the Elder Wand fly high, dark against the sunrise, spinning across the enchanted ceiling, spinning through the air toward the master it would not kill, who had come to take full possession of it at last.": "J.K.",

And the souls of these departed joined hands, clasped ankles, and formed a web, a great net of souls, and the souls were three-atom oxygen molecules of the stuff of ozone, and the outer rim absorbed them and was repaired.

  "At such moments the collapse of their courage, willpower, and endurance was so abrupt that they felt they could never drag themselves out of the pit of despond into which they had fallen. Therefore they forced themselves never to think about the problematic day of escape, to cease looking to the future, and always to keep, so to speak, their eyes fixed on the ground at their feet. But, naturally enough, this prudence, this habit of feinting with their predicament and refusing to put up a fight, was ill rewarded. For, while averting that revulsion which they found so unbearable, they also deprived themselves of those redeeming moments, frequent enough when all is told, when by conjuring up pictures of a reunion to be, they could forget about the plague. Thus, in a middle course between these heights and depths, they drifted through life rather than lived, the prey of aimless days and sterile memories, like wandering shadows that could have acquired substance only by consenting to root themselves in the solid earth of their distress.": "Albert",

  "Faith, hope and charity go together. Hope is practised through the virtue of patience, which continues to do good even in the face of apparent failure, and through the virtue of humility, which accepts God's mystery and trusts him even at times of darkness. Faith tells us that God has given his Son for our sakes and gives us the victorious certainty that it is really true: God is love! It thus transforms our impatience and our doubts into the sure hope that God holds the world in his hands and that, as the dramatic imagery of the end of the Book of Revelation points out, in spite of all darkness he ultimately triumphs in glory. Faith, which sees the love of God revealed in the pierced heart of Jesus on the Cross, gives rise to love. Love is the light\u2014and in the end, the only light\u2014that can always illuminate a world grown dim and give us the courage needed to keep living and working. Love is possible, and we are able to practise it because we are created in the image of God.

  "Eddie saw great things and near misses. Albert Einstein as a child, not quite struck by a run-away milk-wagon as he crossed a street. A teenage boy named Albert Schweitzer getting out of a bathtub and not quite stepping on the cake of soap lying beside the pulled plug. A Nazi Oberleutnant burning a piece of paper with the date and place of the D-Day Invasion written on it. He saw a man who intended to poison the entire water supply of Denver die of a heart attack in a roadside rest-stop on I-80 in Iowa with a bag of McDonald\u2019s French fries on his lap. He saw a terrorist wired up with explosives suddenly turn away from a crowded restaurant in a city that might have been Jerusalem. The terrorist had been transfixed by nothing more than the sky, and the thought that it arced above the just and unjust alike. He saw four men rescue a little boy from a monster whose entire head seemed to consist of a single eye.\tBut more important than any of these was the vast, accretive weight of small things, from planes which hadn\u2019t crashed to men and women who had come to the correct place at the perfect time and thus founded generations. He saw kisses exchanged in doorways and wallets returned and men who had come to a splitting of the way and chosen the right fork. He saw a thousand random meetings that weren\u2019t random, ten thousand right decisions, a hundred thousand right answers, a million acts of unacknowledged kindness. He saw the old people of River Crossing and Roland kneeling in the dust for Aunt Talitha\u2019s blessing; again heard her giving it freely and gladly. Heard her telling him to lay the cross she had given him at the foot of the Dark Tower and speak the name of Talitha Unwin at the far end of the earth. He saw the Tower itself in the burning folds of the rose and for a moment understood its purpose: how it distributed its lines of force to all the worlds that were and held them steady in time\u2019s great helix. For every brick that landed on the ground instead of some little kid\u2019s head, for every tornado that missed the trailer park, for every missile that didn\u2019t fly, for every hand stayed from violence, there was the Tower.\tAnd the quiet, singing voice of the rose.

She discovers further that she is not crazy; the traumatic syndromes are normal human responses to extreme circumstances. And she discovers, finally, that she is not doomed to suffer this condition indefinitely; she can expect to recover, as others have recovered...": "Judith",

  "Four times during the first six days they were assembled and briefed and then sent back. Once, they took off and were flying in formation when the control tower summoned them down. The more it rained, the worse they suffered. The worse they suffered, the more they prayed that it would continue raining. All through the night, men looked at the sky and were saddened by the stars. All through the day, they looked at the bomb line on the big, wobbling easel map of Italy that blew over in the wind and was dragged in under the awning of the intelligence tent every time the rain began. The bomb line was a scarlet band of narrow satin ribbon that delineated the forward most position of the Allied ground forces in every sector of the Italian mainland.For hours they stared relentlessly at the scarlet ribbon on the map and hated it because it would not move up high enough to encompass the city.When night fell, they congregated in the darkness with flashlights, continuing their macabre vigil at the bomb line in brooding entreaty as though hoping to move the ribbon up by the collective weight of their sullen prayers. \"I really can't believe it,\" Clevinger exclaimed to Yossarian in a voice rising and falling in protest and wonder. \"It's a complete reversion to primitive superstition. They're confusing cause and effect. It makes as much sense as knocking on wood or crossing your fingers. They really believe that we wouldn't have to fly that mission tomorrow if someone would only tiptoe up to the map in the middle of the night and move the bomb line over Bologna. Can you imagine? You and I must be the only rational ones left.\"In the middle of the night Yossarian knocked on wood, crossed his fingers, and tiptoed out of his tent to move the bomb line up over Bologna.": "Joseph",

It means taking responsibility for the character of the human world. That's a real confrontation with the problem of value.

  "Even after centuries of human interacting, children still continue to rebel against their parents and siblings. Young marrieds look upon their in-laws and parents as obstacles to their independence and growth. Parents view their children as selfish ingrates. Husbands desert their wives and seek greener fields elsewhere. Wives form relationships with heroes of soap operas who vicariously bring excitement and romance into their empty lives. Workers often hate their bosses and co-workers and spend miserable hours with them, day after day. On a larger scale, management cannot relate with labour. Each accuses the other of unreasonable self-interests and narrow-mindedness. Religious groups often become entrapped, each in a provincial dogma resulting in hate and vindictiveness in the name of God. Nations battle blindly, under the shadow of the world annihilation, for the realization of their personal rights. Members of these groups blame rival groups for their continual sense of frustration, impotence, lack of progress and communication. We have obviously not learned much over the years. We have not paused long enough to consider the simple truth that we humans are not born with particular attitudinal sets regarding other persons, we are taught into them. We are the future generation's teachers. We are, therefore, the perpetrators of the confusion and alienation we abhor and which keeps us impotent in finding new alternatives. It is up to us to diligently discover new solutions and learn new patterns of relating, ways more conducive to growth, peace, hope and loving coexistence.

Would they rebuild at all? Could they continue to progress, knowing that they would be powerless to reclaim their future? And what if that future saw another rise of the living dead? Would our descendants rise to meet them in battle, or simply crumple in meek surrender and accept what they believe to be their inevitable extinction? For this alone, we had to reclaim our planet.

Let us so run that we may obtain: let us endure hardness as good soldiers; let us finish our course, and keep the faith, reliant in the issue to come off more than conquerors: 'Art though not from everlasting mine Holy One? WE SHALL NOT DIE!": "Charlotte",

  "My theory is that hope is a form of madness. A benevolent one, sure, but madness all the same.

How would you feel, surrounded by billions of human beings taking Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, the tooth fairy and the stork seriously, and capable of shaming, maiming or murdering in their name? I am embarrassed to live in a world retaining any faith in church, prayer or a celestial creator. I do not believe in Heaven, Hell or a Hereafter; in angels, demons, ghosts, goblins, the Devil, vampires, ghouls, zombies, witches, warlocks, UFOs or other delusions; and in very few mundane individuals--politicians, lawyers, judges, priests, militarists, censors and just plain people. I respect the individual's right to abortion, suicide and euthanasia. I support birth control. I wish to Good that society were rid of smoking, drinking and drugs.My hope for humanity - and I think sensible science fiction has a beneficial influence in this direction - is that one day everyone born will be whole in body and brain, will live a long life free from physical and emotional pain, will participate in a fulfilling way in their contribution to existence, will enjoy true love and friendship, will pity us 20th century barbarians who lived and died in an atrocious, anachronistic atmosphere of arson, rape, robbery, kidnapping, child abuse, insanity, murder, terrorism, war, smog, pollution, starvation and the other negative \u201cnorms\u201d of our current civilization.

He even smiled grimly, feeling now as clearly as a moment before he had felt the opposite, that what he had to do, he had to do, if he could, and that whether Faramir or Aragorn or Elrond or Galadriel or Gandalf or anyone else knew about it was beside the purpose. He took his staff in one hand and the phial in his other. When he saw that the clear light was already welling through his fingers, he thrust it into his bosom and held it against his heart.

  "From Les Miserables:All at once, in the midst of this profound calm, a fresh sound arose; a sound as celestial, divine, ineffable, ravishing, as the other had been horrible. It was a hymn which issued from the gloom, a dazzling burst of prayer and harmony in the obscure and alarming silence of the night; women's voices, but voices composed at one and the same time of the pure accents of virgins and the innocent accent of children, -- voices which are not of the earth, and which resemble those that the newborn infant still hears, and which the dying man hears already. This song proceeded from the gloomy edifice which towered above the garden. At the moment when the hubbub of demons retreated, one would have said that a choir of angels was approaching through the gloom.Cosette and Jean Valjean fell on their knees.They knew not what it was, they knew not where they were; but both of them, the man and the child, the penitent and the innocent, felt that they must kneel.These voices had this strange characteristic, that they did not prevent the building from seeming to be deserted. It was a supernatural chant in an uninhabited house. While these voices were singing, Jean Valjean thought of nothing. He no longer beheld the night; he beheld a blue sky. It seemed to him that he felt those wings which we all have within us, unfolding.The song died away. It may have lasted a long time. Jean Valjean could not have told. Hours of ecstasy are never more than a moment.": "Victor",

  "Now I want you to remember something because I don't think we shall meet again very soon. It is this; however fashionable despair about the world and about people may be at present, and however powerful despair may become in the future, not everybody, or even most people, think and live fashionably; virtue and honour will not be banished from the world, however many popular moralists and panicky journalists say so. Sacrifice will not cease to be because psychiatrists have popularized the idea that there is often some concealed, self-serving element in it; theologians always knew that. Nor do I think love as a high condition of honour will be lost; it is a pattern in the spirit, and people long to make the pattern a reality in their own lives, whatever means they take to do so. In short, Davey, God is not dead. And I can assure you God is not mocked.": "Robertson",

For most, their time suckling at her breast is naught but a scramble through stinging, tearing briars before a naked, shameful collapse as the flesh gives out. And yet in the bright eyes of every newborn, there lies a spark, a potential for goodness, the possibility of a life worth living. That spark deserves its chance. And though most of them will turn out to be as worthless as the parents who sired them, while the cruelty of the earth will tell them to release their innocence and join in the drawing of daggers, every now and then one manages to clutch to its beauty and refuses to release it into the dark.": "Ed",

A small thing. A voice. I listen. There are more voices. The sounds are human. How long has it been since I\u2019ve heard a human? The sounds scratch along my now present attention. They carve into my hearing. They are horrid, wretched things. Voices screaming. Growing loud and desperate. How many voices? Billions. This is the birth of our species. We are born screaming.

She lives in the future. Where the world is turning. I live within the past. Where the people are trapped and screaming and alone. I live within the past when Valeria and I were in love.

Tales of past likes and loves, lessons learned, and the stories about how you met the right person and how you ended up with them - often a winding tale until there's an 'AH-HA' moment of enlightenment, lol.

The suffering is actually merciful, from a God who would literally do ANYTHING to get us to run into His arms.": "Carrie",

  "Do you think they\u2019ll ever be a place for us? I mean, do you think there\u2019s a place for someone who lives under the radar, someone who has to pretend, someone who is a spy?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d Daly said it with such confidence that I sat up in my bed, my cast dangling over the edge. \u201cHow do you know?\u201d I asked. \u201cThere has to be. I don\u2019t usually philosophize, but I do know one thing.\u201d \u201cWhat\u2019s that?\u201d \u201cThat even when we\u2019re pretending, even when we\u2019re hiding under wigs or accents or clothes that aren\u2019t our style, we can\u2019t hide our nature. Just like I knew from the moment I met you that you would choose this life. And just like I knew, when you told me about this mission, that you would agree to help the CIA find this girl. You would sacrifice yourself and your time with your brother to save someone. It\u2019s just who you are.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve already messed things up, Daly. What if I\u2019m not good enough? What if I can\u2019t do it?\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s the thing, though. You\u2019ll find a way.\u201d I lay back again and buried the side of my face into my pillow. \u201cI\u2019m just not sure how.\u201d \u201cIf you continue to think as you\u2019ve always thought, you\u2019ll continue to get what you\u2019ve always got,\u201d Daly said. I considered that. I wasn\u2019t ready to give up. At least not yet. \u201cThat one is Itosu wisdom, in case you wondered.\u201d I yawned into the phone. \u201cIt\u2019s good advice.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll let you go. You should be resting. Don\u2019t you have school in the morning?\u201d He said the last part in a teasing tone. \u201cYeah, if I make it through another day at school. Maybe they\u2019ll get rid of me\u2014kick me out or something. You\u2019d think I would have inherited some of my mom\u2019s artistic genius.\u201d \u201cCan I give you one last bit of advice, Alex?\u201d \u201cSure.\u201d \u201cThrow it all out the window.\u201d \u201cWhat?\u201d I stared at my open window. A slight breeze blew the gauzelike drapes in and out as if they were a living creature. \u201cEverything you\u2019ve learned about art, the lines, the colors, the pictures in your head from other artists\u2014just throw it all out. And throw out everything you\u2019ve learned from books and simulations about being a good spy. Don\u2019t try to be like someone else. Don\u2019t force yourself to follow a set of rules that weren\u2019t meant for you. Those work for 99.99% of the people.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re telling me I\u2019m the .01%?\u201d I asked skeptically. \u201cNo, I\u2019m telling you you\u2019re not even on the scale.\u201d Daly\u2019s soft breathing traveled through the phone line. \u201cWith a mind like yours, you can\u2019t be put in a box. Or even expected to stand outside it. You were never meant to hold still, Alex. You have to stack all the boxes up and climb and keep climbing until you find you. I\u2019m just saying that Alexandra Stewart will find her own way.\u201d The cool night air brushed the skin of my arm and I wished it was Daly\u2019s hand instead. \u201cYou sure have a lot of wisdom tonight,\u201d I told him. I expected him to laugh. Instead, the line went silent for a moment. \u201cBecause I\u2019m not there. Because I wish I was.\u201d His words were simple, but his message reached inside my heart and left a warmth\u2014a warmth I needed. \u201cThank you, James.\u201d\u201cTake care, Alex.\u201d I wanted to say more, to keep him at my ear just a little longer. Yet the words itching to break free couldn\u2019t be said from over two thousand miles away. They needed to happen in person. I wasn\u2019t going home until I found Amoriel.

One tends to think of it almost as a phenomenon, without any roots or place in the natural world. And yet it, too, has had its tough old ancestors which have eluded fires and drought and freezes to pass on in this lovely form the boon of existence. If a plant so delicately lovely can at the same time be so toughly persistent and resistant to all natural enemies, can we doubt that hopes for a better an more rational world may not also withstand all assaults, be bequeathed from generation to generation, and come ultimately to flower?President Roosevelt says he has not lost faith in democracy; nor have I lost faith in the transcendent potentialities of LIFE itself.

We are dead in sin. \"But God, who is rich in mercy, because of the great love which he loved us, even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ\" (Ephesians 2:4-5). The Father, in His infinite mercy and grace, saved us in Christ Jesus.": "James",
  "The Christian has been drawn unto Christ. Those who wish to boast in having something to do with their salvation, or who insist that the final decision lays with man, resist the clear meaning of Christ's words, \"draw.\" But this is a wondrous term. It is beautiful to hear. Drawn in love. Drawn in mercy. Drawn unto the one who died in my place. It is sovereign action, undertaken by the one who holds the entire universe by His power. It is an irresistible drawing, most definitely, but is a drawing of grace. The one drawing loves the one who is being drawn. And those drawn can never be thankful enough to God who brought them out of darkness into the marvelous light of Christ.": "James",

Invisible to the five senses, they work from the most unbelievable places, places where they're hardly found, or when found never recognized. I change country at an average of three to six times a year, and travel to places as unpredictable as Lithuania, Julian Assange is in the Equator's Embassy in England, David Icke lives in a tiny apartment in a Island that few have heard about, and then there are many others that you've never seen or met. Without us, there would be no meaning for hope. We may one day be found and recognized, maybe even get statues and other works of art in our name and that will likely happen after we're gone. So we can't say we're doing it for the money or recognition. We're risking our lives for those that show no appreciation or support, for those that rather spend 10 dollars in a meal than two in a book, for those that to a great extent have ridicule us for a longer time than the one in which they've shown respect.": "Robin",

Many of us confuse hope with optimism, a prevailing attitude that \"things turn out for the best.\" But hope differs from optimism. Hope does not arise from being told to \"Think Positively,\" or from hearing an overly rosy forecast. Hope, unlike optimism, is rooted in unalloyed reality. Although there is no uniform definition of hope, I found on that seemed to capture what my patients had taught me. Hope is the elevating feeling we experience when we see - in the mind's eye- a path to a better future. Hope acknowledges the significant obstacles and deep pitfalls along that path.

  "Anticipation lifts the heart. Desire is created to be fulfilled - perhaps not all at once, more likely in slow stages. Isaiah uttered his prophetic words about the renewal of the natural Creation into a wilderness of spiritual barrenness and thirst. For him, and for many other Old Testament seers, the vacuum of dry indifference into which he spoke was not yet a place of fulfillment. Yet the promise of God through this human mouthpiece (and the word \"promise\" always holds a kind of certainty) was verdant with hope, a kind of greenness and glory. A softening of hard-heartedness, a lively expectation, would herald the coming of Messiah. And once again, in this season of Advent, the same promise for the same Anointed One is coming closer.": "Luci",

  "People referred to the symbolism of the empty Cross more than once on its journey. It would seem obviously to point to our faith in Jesus\u2019 resurrection. It\u2019s not quite so simple though. The Cross is bare, but in and of itself the empty Cross does not point directly to the Resurrection. It says only that the body of Jesus was removed from the Cross. If a crucifix is a symbol of Good Friday, then it is the image of the empty tomb that speaks more directly of Easter and resurrection. The empty Cross is a symbol of Holy Saturday. It\u2019s an indicator of the reality of Jesus\u2019 death, of His sharing in our mortal coil. At the same time, the empty Cross is an implicit sign of impending resurrection, and it tells us that the Cross is not only a symbol of hatred, violence and inhumanity: it says that the Cross is about something more.The empty Cross also tells us not to jump too quickly to resurrection, as if the Resurrection were a trump card that somehow absolves us from suffering. The Resurrection is not a divine \u2018get-out-of-jail free\u2019 card that immunises people from pain, suffering or death. To jump too quickly to the Resurrection runs the risk of trivialising people\u2019s pain and seemingly mapping out a way through suffering that reduces the reality of having to live in pain and endure it at times. For people grieving, introducing the message of the Resurrection too quickly cheapens or nullifies their sense of loss. The empty Cross reminds us that we cannot avoid suffering and death. At the same time, the empty Cross tells us that, because of Jesus\u2019 death, the meaning of pain, suffering and our own death has changed, that these are not all-crushing or definitive. The empty Cross says that the way through to resurrection must always break in from without as something new, that it cannot be taken hold of in advance of suffering or seized as a panacea to pain. In other words, the empty Cross is a sign of hope. It tells us that the new life of God surprises us, comes at a moment we cannot expect, and reminds us that experiences of pain, grief and dying are suffused with the presence of Christ, the One Who was crucified and is now risen.": "Chris",

  "I think I\u2019m getting a notion of how to do this. O.K., a carnival works because people pay to feel amazed and scared. They can nibble around a midway getting amazed here and scared there, or both. And do you know what else? Hope. Hope they\u2019ll win a prize, break the jackpot, meet a girl, hit a bull\u2019s-eye in front of their buddies. In a carnival you call it luck or chance, but it\u2019s the same as hope. Now hope is a good feeling that needs risk to work. How good it is depends on how big the risk is if what you hope doesn\u2019t happen. You hope your old auntie croaks and leaves you a carload of shekels, but she might leave them to her cat. You might not hit the target or win the stuffed dog, you might lose your money and look like a fool. You don\u2019t get the surge without the risk. Well. Religion works the same way. The only difference is that it\u2019s more amazing than even Chick or the twins. And it\u2019s a whole lot scarier than the Roll-a-plane or the Screamer, or any simp twister. This scare stuff laps over into the hope department too. The hope you get from religion is a three-ring, all-star hope because the risk is outrageous. Bad! Well, I\u2019m working on it. I\u2019ve got the amazing part down. And the scary bits are a snap. But I\u2019ve got to come up with a hope.": "Katherine",

  "Why do people go to church on Sundays? A question that is very complicated because I know what the answer is supposed to be but I do not really know the answer.. I think people go because it is a kind of tradition. I think some goes because someone told them if tgey do not they might go to hell. Maybe some go to look for a wife or husband \u263a. Maybe some go to church to display their latest designer shoes or handbags. Some goes just to please their Pastor. Some people go to church because they love the music or the preaching. Some goes because of some social reasons and friendship. Some have it in their mind that they will experience the presence of God in the church. Some goes to church because of miracle. Some goes to church when they are expecting something maybe child, comfort, marriage, work etc.. Some felt it is an obligation to give God a day out of the seven days he createdLet me tell you that church is not there to entertain you, Ephesians 3:20... there are things going on in the church that some people barely know about.Ask yourself today why do I go to church.

The invisible years are years of serving, studying, being faithful in another person\u2019s ministry and doing the behind-the-scenes work.

  "How dreadful are the curses which Mohammedanism lays on its votaries! Besides the fanatical frenzy, which is as dangerous in a man as hydrophobia in a dog, there is this fearful fatalistic apathy. The effects are apparent in many countries. Improvident habits, slovenly systems of agriculture, sluggish methods of commerce, and insecurity of property exist wherever the followers of the Prophet rule or live. A degraded sensualism deprives this life of its grace and refinement; the next of its dignity and sanctity. The fact that in Mohammedan law every woman must belong to some man as his absolute property \u2013 either as a child, a wife, or a concubine \u2013 must delay the final extinction of slavery until the faith of Islam has ceased to be a great power among men. Thousands become the brave and loyal soldiers of the faith: all know how to die but the influence of the religion paralyses the social development of those who follow it. No stronger retrograde force exists in the world. Far from being moribund, Mohammedanism is a militant and proselytizing faith. It has already spread throughout Central Africa, raising fearless warriors at every step; and were it not that Christianity is sheltered in the strong arms of science, the science against which it had vainly struggled, the civilisation of modern Europe might fall, as fell the civilisation of ancient Rome.": "Winston",

My absolute favourite piece of information is the fact that young sloths are so inept that they frequently grab their own arms and legs instead of tree limbs, and fall out of trees. However, this is not relevant to what is currently on my mind because it concerns sloths, whereas the Branwell Bront\u00eb piece of information concerns writers and feeling like death and doing things to prove they can be done, all of which are pertinent to my current situation to a degree that is, frankly, spooky.": "Douglas",
  "To escape death, she'd become death.": "Sarah",
  "People who get up early in the morning cause war, death and famine.": "Banksy,",
  "Anyway, I'm sort of glad they've got the atomic bomb invented. If there's ever another war, I'm going to sit right the hell on top of it. I'll volunteer for it, I swear to God I will.": "J.D.",
  "Dying should come easy:like a freight train youdon't hear whenyour back isturned.": "Charles",
  "We do not need to grieve for the dead. Why should we grieve for them? They are now in a place where there is no more shadow, darkness, loneliness, isolation, or pain. They are home.": "John",
  "I've got death inside me. It's just a question of whether or not I can outlive it.": "Don",
  "Yer a good lad, Atticus, mowin\u2019 me lawn and killin\u2019 what Brits come around.": "Kevin",
  "We're standing here, beat to shit, walking away from a crime scene where either or both of us could have bought it, and you're asking me to marry you?\"\"Perfect timing.": "J.D.",
  "Every poem should remind the reader that they are going to die.": "Edgar",
  "Peter was not quite like other boys; but he was afraid at last. A tremour ran through him, like a shudder passing over the sea; but on the sea one shudder follows another till there are hundreds of them, and Peter felt just the one. Next moment he was standing erect on the rock again, with that smile on his face and a drum beating within him. It was saying, \"To die will be an awfully big adventure.": "J.M.",
  "Everyone sounded the same when they died.": "Sarah",
  "Oh Lestat, you deserved everything that's ever happened to you. You better not die. You might actually go to hell.": "Anne",
  "No matter what, I want to continue living with the awareness that I will die. Without that, I am not alive.": "Banana",
  "And I put my hand on her arm to stop her rowing.Aaron\u2019s Noise roars up in red and black.The current takes us on.\u201cI\u2019m sorry!\u201d I cry as the river takes us away, my words ragged things torn from me, my chest pulled so tight I can\u2019t barely breathe. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, Manchee!\u201d?\u201d\u201cManchee!\u201d I scream.Aaron brings his free hand towards my dog.\u201cMANCHEE!\u201d?\u201dAnd Aaron wrenches his arms and there\u2019s a CRACK and a scream and a cut-off yelp that tears my heart in two forever and forever.And the pain is too much it\u2019s too much it\u2019s too much and my hands are on my head and I\u2019m rearing back and my mouth is open in a never-ending wordless wail of all the blackness that\u2019s inside of me.": "Patrick",
  "Believe me, when you die, it's everybody else's but your problem": "Cecelia",
  "Of all the ways to lose a person, death is the kindest.": "Ralph",
  "And then I did what I had never done in his presence, much less in his arms. I cried.": "Erich",
  "Do you not know that a man is not dead while his name is still spoken?": "Terry",
  "I held her close for only a short time, but after she was gone, I'd see her smile on the face of a perfect stranger and I knew she would be there with me all the rest of my days.": "Brian",
  "They say that war is death's best friend, but I must offer you a different point of view on that one. To me, war is like the new boss who expects the impossible. He stands over your shoulder repeating one thin, incessantly: 'Get it done, get it done.' So you work harder. You get the job done. The boss, however, does not thank you. He asks for more.": "Markus",
  "Those who shun the whimsy of things will experience rigor mortis before death.": "Tom",
  "When the first living thing existed, I was there waiting. When the last living thing dies, my job will be finished. I'll put the chairs on the tables, turn out the lights and lock the universe behind me when I leave.": "Neil",
  "About here, she thought, dabbling her fingers in the water, a ship had sunk, and she muttered, dreamily half asleep, how we perished, each alone.": "Virginia",
  "I think anyone who opened their heart enough to love without restraint and subsequently were devastated by loss knows that in that moment you are forever changed; a apart of you is no longer whole. Some will never again love with that level of abandon where life is perceived as innocent and the threat of loss seems implausible. Love and loss, therefore, are linked.": "Donna",
  "Things change after you die, though, I guess because dying is the loneliest thing you can do.": "Lauren",
  "We fear death, we shudder at life's instability, we grieve to see the flowers wilt again and again, and the leaves fall, and in our hearts we know that we, too, are transitory and will soon disappear. When artists create pictures and thinkers search for laws and formulate thoughts, it is in order to salvage something from the great dance of death, to make something last longer than we do.": "Hermann",
  "Conscience is no more than the dead speaking to us.": "Jim",
  "If this continues, if this goes on, then when I die, your memories of me will be my greatest accomplishment. You memories will be my most lasting impressions.": "David",
  "Can you do it? When the time comes? When the time comes there will be no time. Now is the time. Curse God and die.": "Cormac",
  "The only sin is the sin of being born": "Samuel",
  "Chronic anxiety is a state more undesirable than any other, and we will try almost any maneuver to eliminate it. Modern man is living in anxious anticipation of destruction. Such anxiety can be easily eliminated by self-destruction. As a German saying puts it: 'Better an end with terror than a terror without end.": "Robert",
  "He felt his heart pounding fiercely in his chest. How strange that in his dread of death, it pumped all the harder, valiantly keeping him alive. But it would have to stop, and soon. Its beats were numbered. How many would there be time for, as he rose and walked through the castle for the last time, out into the grounds and into the forest?": "J.K.",
  "They say even death can't cure an idiot.-Ririn": "Tite",
  "Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in mankind, and therefore never send to know for whom the bells tolls; it tolls for thee.": "John",
  "I died for beauty but was scarceAdjusted in the tomb,When one who died for truth was lainIn an adjoining room.He questioned softly why I failed?\"For beauty,\" I replied.\"And I for truth, the two are one;We brethren are,\" he said.And so, as kinsmen met a night,We talked between the rooms,Until the moss had reached our lips,And covered up our names.": "Emily",
  "A halo surrounded the grim reaper nun, Sister Maria. (By the way-I like this human idea of the grim reaper. I like the scythe. It amuses me.)": "Markus",
  "It's all right, Tessa, you can go. We love you. You can go now.''Why are you saying that?''She might need permission to die, Cal.''I don't want her to. She doesn't have my permission.": "Jenny",
  "Something has spoken to me in the night...and told me that I shall die, I know not where. Saying: \"[Death is] to lose the earth you know for greater knowing; to lose the life you have, for greater life; to leave the friends you loved, for greater loving; to find a land more kind than home, more large than earth.": "Thomas",
  "You can't just make yourself matter and then die, Alaska, because now I am irretrievably different, and I'm sorry I let you go, yes, but you made the choice. You left me Perhapsless, stuck in your goddamned labyrinth. And now I don't even know if you chose the straight and fast way out, if you left me like this on purpose. And so I never knew you, did I? I can't remember, because I never knew.": "John",
  "For this moment, this one moment, we are together. I press you to me. Come, pain, feed on me. Bury your fangs in my flesh. Tear me asunder. I sob, I sob.": "Virginia",
  "Miss Mary Mack, Mack, Mack, all dressed in black, black, black. She has a knife, knife, knife, stuck in her back, back, back. She cannot breathe, breathe, breathe. She cannot cry, cry, cry. Thats why she begs, begs, begs. She begs to die, die ,die..": "Laurie",
  "Would you give up your vengeance against someone you hate if it meant saving someone you love? Would you want your dreams to come true if it meant granting your enemy's dying wish?": "Jodi",
  "I'm not blessed, or merciful. I'm just me. I've got a job to do, and I do it. Listen: even as we're talking, I'm there for old and young, innocent and guilty, those who die together and those who die alone. I'm in cars and boats and planes; in hospitals and forests and abbatoirs. For some folks death is a release, and for others death is an abomination, a terrible thing. But in the end, I'm there for all of them.": "Neil",
  "When someone you love dies, you are given the gift of \"second chances\". Their eulogy is a reminder that the living can turn their lives around at any point. You\u2019re not bound by the past; that is who you used to be. You\u2019re reminded that your feelings are not who you are, but how you felt at that moment. Your bad choices defined you yesterday, but they are not who you are today. Your future doesn\u2019t have to travel the same path with the same people. You can start over. You don\u2019t have to apologize to people that won\u2019t listen. You don\u2019t have to justify your feelings or actions, during a difficult time in your life. You don\u2019t have to put up with people that are insecure and want you to fail. All you have to do is walk forward with a positive outlook, and trust that God has a plan that is greater than the sorrow you left behind. The people of quality that were meant to be in your life won\u2019t need you to explain the beauty of your heart. They already understand what being human is----a roller coaster ride of emotions during rainstorms and sunshine, sprinkled with moments when you can almost reach the stars.": "Shannon",
  "Death walks faster than the wind and never returns what he has taken.": "Hans"
